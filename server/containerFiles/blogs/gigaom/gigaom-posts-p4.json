Many leading technology providers are therefore optimizing their software to run on AWS as well as building globally available cloud services delivered through AWS&#8217; worldwide regions. <\/p>\n<p>Splunk has been very pleased with the success of our SaaS business on AWS, so we thought we&#8217;d share what we&#8217;ve learned in the form of best practices for you to keep in mind when developing your software or SaaS business on AWS.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1.\tEmbrace the change<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve attended the keynote at any recent AWS Summit, you&#8217;ve heard the message &#8220;cloud is the new normal.&#8221; Our advice is to take this to heart, and invest in your business knowing the momentum behind cloud will only continue to accelerate.<\/p>\n<p>This is a boon to businesses of every size and in every location around the world\u2014cloud makes it easier than ever before to innovate, rapidly bring an offering to market and serve your customer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2.\tRelentlessly focus on the customer experience<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Focusing your business on customer success is a must when building a business on AWS.<\/p>\n<p>Why? Because the number one driving factor behind everything AWS does is to help its customers be successful and innovative. Tactically, this can mean many things for a SaaS Partner, but the one that stands out is building technology integrations that can provide additional value to AWS customers. <\/p>\n<p>A good example of this involves AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config, services that deliver log data on AWS API calls around user activity and resource changes. When properly harnessed, these services help enable enterprises ensure security and compliance of their AWS deployments. A handful of SaaS Partners deliver integrations for these AWS services. The importance of these integrations is clear when you think of the importance of security and compliance for any successful AWS deployment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3.\tLeverage your customers in your go-to-market strategy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When it comes to building your software or SaaS business on AWS, nothing beats customer validation. One of the most compelling stories is when a customer fully integrates your technology into their AWS strategy.<\/p>\n<p>A great example of this is the Federal Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). FINRA is an independent regulator that examines all securities firms and their registered persons and monitors trading on U.S. markets. To respond to rapidly changing market dynamics, FINRA is moving its platform to Amazon Web Services (AWS) to analyze and store approximately 30 billion market events every day. FINRA uses <a href=\"http:\/\/www.splunk.com\/en_us\/solutions\/solution-areas\/cloud.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Splunk Cloud<\/a> to ensure security and compliance in their AWS deployment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4.\tChoose AWS and go &#8220;all-in&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When building out your cloud strategy, you have to make choices. Our advice: When two roads diverge in the cloud, choose AWS.<\/p>\n<p>This is a best practice because AWS has the richest and broadest set of services in the market. If your offering is storage intensive, there are specific solutions for that; if it&#8217;s compute intensive, there are specific solutions for that; if it&#8217;s I\/O intensive, there are specific solutions for that as well. Regardless of what you need on the infrastructure stack\u2014whether it&#8217;s automated provisioning, configuration or management, AWS has a mature solution that fits the bill.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, business today is global. To successfully grow your business you need the ability to rapidly expand around the world. AWS offers that through their 11 worldwide regions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5.\tLeverage the ecosystem<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re building on AWS, chances are that other folks building on AWS will find it useful. This is what makes the AWS announcement of its SaaS Partner Program so exciting. If you&#8217;re building a SaaS storage solution, odds are we could use it for our SaaS operational and security monitoring solution. Since we&#8217;re building a SaaS operational and security monitoring solution, odds are you could use it for your SaaS storage solution.<\/p>\n<p>We have the opportunity to be better together on AWS for the benefit of all of our customers.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about our cloud solutions, visit us <a href=\"http:\/\/www.splunk.com\/en_us\/solutions\/solution-areas\/cloud.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[person]As AWS increasingly becomes the preferred deployment model for enterprise applications and services, it&#8217;s never been more important for a software or&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611559,"featured_media":938055,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[7867394,359218029,359217009],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/938041"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611559"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=938041"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/938041\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/938055"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=938041"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=938041"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=938041"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":940973,"date":"2016-01-19T10:49:08","date_gmt":"2016-01-19T18:49:08","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/?p=248667"},"modified":"2016-02-25T13:45:21","modified_gmt":"2016-02-25T21:45:21","slug":"virtual-reality-just-for-fun-it-wont-stay-that-way","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/01\/19\/virtual-reality-just-for-fun-it-wont-stay-that-way\/","title":{"rendered":"Virtual Reality: Just for fun?

This\u00a0involved Williams, as toy designer Leslie Zevo, sitting on a sofa with his sister Alsatia (played by Joan Cusack) and wearing what looked like eye masks. As the pair rocked, screamed and waved their hands in the air it became clear that they were watching a roller coaster simulation.<\/p>\n<p>Spot the date: over a quarter of a century has now passed since virtual reality (VR) headsets first entered the popular consciousness. A number of challenges have had to be overcome \u2014 not least insufficient screen resolution and movement tracking, which have been considered as causes of queasiness when headsets are worn.<\/p>\n<p>But also, cost. I can remember, back then, considering the scenario of a young rebel on a city metro train, sporting cool-looking glasses that beamed images onto his retinas. Even if this were yet possible, it would be cost-prohibitive. But it is coming.<\/p>\n<p>A mere three years have passed since\u00a0Palmer Luckey first set himself the task of producing a low-cost VR headset. Following a\u00a0luck(e)y break when he met John Carmack, creator of the seminal first-person shooter Doom, Palmer followed the footsteps of so many entrepreneurs when he left college to follow his dreams.<\/p>\n<p>The Kickstarter <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/1523379957\/oculus-rift-step-into-the-game\">campaign<\/a> for the Oculus Rift heads-up display raised nearly $2.5m and while the device is yet to be released, its technology is <a href=\"https:\/\/news.samsung.com\/global\/infographic-gear-vr-a-virtual-reality-headset-with-world-class-resolution-and-performance\">already<\/a> built into Samsung Gear devices.\u00a0As it arrives however, the Rift is already offering more potential than just viewing images and videos.<\/p>\n<p>To understand why VR in general, and the Rift in particular, are set to be such a game changer, we need to consider not just the headset but how it fits with a range of other technologies. Augmented reality for <a href=\"https:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/report\/augmented-reality-in-the-enterprise-opportunities-and-challenges\/\">example<\/a>, which links visuals with context-based data. Motion tracking from the likes of <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2013\/07\/22\/leap-motion-as-far-as-controllers-go-its-not-a-big-leap-forward-yet\/\">Leap<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xbox.com\/en-GB\/xbox-one\/accessories\/kinect-for-xbox-one\">Kinect<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not how any one technology delivers that matters; rather, it is how they can be used in combination. You can think of all the pieces as components of a new range of solutions, which have applicability in <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2015\/12\/23\/retail-technology-trends-2015-a-year-of-digital-disruption\/\">retail<\/a>, in healthcare, in navigation, in geology and (as per Mr Williams) in film, media and all forms of entertainment.<\/p>\n<p>Audi\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/smbz.us\/1JWl3xw\">world\u2019s first fully digital car showroom<\/a>,\u201d based in London, is one example of how VR can benefit the retail experience. Audi integrated a Samsung Gear VR headset, immersing customers in a tour of the car\u2019s features \u2013 you can even take a test drive. While this set-up claims to be the first of its kind, it is unlikely to be the last. As such solutions become prevalent, and as an inevitable consequence of the laws of supply and demand, the components will also become cheaper even as they diversify in form and function.<\/p>\n<p>What other applications might we see? We might see a resurgence in virtual worlds such as Second Life; more likely however is that VR will become part of our daily lives.\u00a0As such it is important for any organisation to consider the implications, which can come from a number of directions. It may be that VR has applicability within the business \u2014 in R&amp;D for example, or in data visualization. Equally, it has potential to change behaviors, for example in how people work and relate to their colleagues.<\/p>\n<p>The bottom line is: today, for many, VR still looks like a fun gadget, and indeed it is outside of certain domains. So have some of that fun \u2014 for a few hundred dollars, invest in some headsets and try them out. That way, when VR becomes more than fun, you will have a more solid perspective into how to integrate VR into your business strategies.<\/p>\n<p><!-- Bitly link here --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While the 1992 film Toys, starring the late, great Robin Williams, did not meet with universal acclaim\u00a0(it registered a paltry 26% at&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87746169,"featured_media":869859,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359256358,18949],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/940973"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87746169"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=940973"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/940973\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/869859"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=940973"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=940973"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=940973"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":938043,"date":"2016-01-18T13:49:27","date_gmt":"2016-01-18T21:49:27","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=938043"},"modified":"2016-01-19T07:38:00","modified_gmt":"2016-01-19T15:38:00","slug":"work-chat-fleep","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/01\/18\/work-chat-fleep\/","title":{"rendered":"Work chat Fleep&#8217;s slash commands, tasks, and email integration"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>2016-01-19: Updated with some corrections.

Fleep is tightly integrated with email, so that non-Fleep users can be invited\u00a0to\u00a0conversations simply by adding their email. If they aren&#8217;t a Fleep user, they can participate through email. This leads to all messages &#8212; including tasks &#8212; being sent to them, and their responses showing up in the conversation. Emailed tasks just look like messages at present, so email only participants can&#8217;t check them off, for example.<\/p>\n<p><em>More importantly to me is that emails directed to Fleep aren&#8217;t treated as tasks but as messages, although they can be converted to tasks. And the model is that a new conversation is created with the other person for these emails. There is no way to direct them to an existing conversation. That&#8217;s a different slant than I am used to, from tools like Todoist.<\/em><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>I have not \u00a0touched on all features of the tool, but probably enough to get a sense for what using it feels like. Fleep is at core, a classic work chat tool, based on contextual conversation (see\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/report\/contextual-conversation-work-chat-will-dominate-collaboration\/\">Contextual conversation: Work chat will dominate collaboration<\/a>). Unlike leading competitors, however, Fleep has integrated task management.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, the limits on Fleep&#8217;s task model would chafe anyone who believes that richer capabilities are essential &#8212; like multiple assignment, subtasks, due dates, start dates, notes, comments, attachments, and so on. However, the fact that tasks and other messages can be brought back into context when looking at a task by selecting &#8216;show in conversation&#8217; does counter some of the issues with notes, comments, and attachments, so long as they are in fact truly contextualized.<\/p>\n<p><em>I hacked a link from a task to a day on my Google Calendar to represent a due date, but that just indicates the direction they might take if they start thinking about due dates and calendar integration.

The arduous, years-long effort to move Zappos to Amazon\u2019s servers has effectively frozen the company\u2019s website, and employees working on the project were offered more time before taking the buyout.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. [Arun] Rajan [Zappo&#8217;s Chief Operating Officer] said that the migration to Super Cloud, which he had hoped to complete last year, was still ongoing. Meanwhile, 38 percent of those working on the Super Cloud transition took the buyout offer.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>My bet is that a lot of these departures are folks that have burned out on the apparently difficult transition to Super Cloud, and the bail-out money simply makes leaving more attractive.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Bud Caddell of Nobl offers some light on what&#8217;s going on at Zappos, because he was asked by Zappos folks (*not* Tony Hsieh, specifically) to give an hour-long &#8216;Teal Talk&#8217;, referring to Frederick Laloux&#8217;s Teal organization concept. Afterward, Caddell remained in contact with some of the Zappos folks. This is causing me to rethink my initial read of the situation: Super Cloud might be the proximate cause of these new defections, but if Caddell is right, Holacracy is the real friction underlying the turmoil.<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-bud-caddell-teal-fai2\" ><p>Bud Caddell, <em><a href=\"http:\/\/us9.campaign-archive2.com\/?u=e80c7e00182317ea114b75362&amp;id=b9d7232edb&amp;e=d5516cbcf4\">Teal Fail<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>For a long time now, I\u2019ve felt like the little boy in &#8220;The Emperor&#8217;s New Clothes,&#8221; but others are finally realizing that, while Holacracy and Reinventing Organizations are compelling ideas, they are patently unsafe for existing businesses to adopt.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, since meeting with Zappos, I\u2019ve met with two other firms that have adopted Holacracy and are now struggling with the reality of its complication, rigidity, and lack of clear return on investment.

While we have come to rely on mobile devices as a critical aspect of business communications, the research found glaring deficiencies underlying the administration of those devices.<\/p>\n<p>Champion surveyed 447 IT decision makers, from a wide variety of sectors, looking to find what is the state of the practice in mobile policy enforcement and security.<\/p>\n<p>The key takeaway is that we\u2019re still in the early stages of dealing with the explosion of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dell.com\/learn\/us\/en\/555\/mobility-byod?dgc=SM&amp;cid=286157&amp;lid=5477257\">BYOD<\/a> in business. Less than one-half of businesses polled have a formal BYOD policy, and less that one in five requires multifactor authentication for mobile.<\/p>\n<p>The findings give a pretty clear picture of a split in BYOD approaches, but many companies are quite immature in their approach:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Organizations are nearly evenly split between those that have a formal BYOD policy (47 percent) and those that do not (53 percent).<\/li>\n<li>When it comes to password policies, most organizations favor complex alphanumeric passwords of six to 10 characters.<\/li>\n<li>More than three-quarters (77 percent) of those polled have policies to lock out devices after multiple failed login attempts, usually between three and five failed tries.<\/li>\n<li>Around 72 percent of organizations require re-authentication of mobile devices after periods of inactivity, with most opting for lockoutafter five to 15 minutes.<\/li>\n<li>The vast majority of those polled have provisions in place for expiring passwords and prohibiting reuse of old passwords.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There is really no reason that companies can\u2019t roll out a BYOD policy in short order, to allow employees to use their devices but to protect the company at the same time. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.itmanagerdaily.com\/byod-policy-template\/\">Here\u2019s a policy<\/a> template from IT Manager Daily, for example, that requires the company to detail what is and isn\u2019t allowed \u2014 such as prohibiting or allowing cell camera use while in the company\u2019s facilities, or enumerating which apps are prohibited and spelling out in detail what the security policies will be.<\/p>\n<p>Most importantly, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cio.com\/article\/2386235\/byod\/how-to-craft-the-best-byod-policy.html\">according to Matt Karlyn<\/a>, of Cooley LLC, a tech savvy law practice, a good BYOD policy will clarify the rights of both the company and the employee. His advice is that a good BYOD policy lays out general rules about personal mobile device usage.<\/p>\n<p><i><b>It clearly articulates what the company\u2019s rights are with respect to monitoring, accessing and reviewing all the data stored on, processed or used by the particular device. It goes through the employee\u2019s obligations with respect to keeping the device secure, password requirements, all the things you\u2019d expect to see in a general IT policy. It talks about what happens if you\u2019re terminated or decide to leave the company.<\/b><\/i><\/p>\n<p>Karlyn concludes that one of the goals should be to avoid any surprises, for example, when litigation or other events lead the company to access or wipe the employee\u2019s device.<\/p>\n<p>As the market for smartphones continues to grow, these issues will become only of greater importance. Market research firm IDC has predicted that nearly 2 billion smartphones will ship globally by 2019, and as much as 60 percent of them will be used in BYOD settings. MarketsandMarkets have projected that to be an over $250 billion market, a 200 percent spike in six years.<\/p>\n<p>Given that sort of growth, it may be unsurprising that formal BYOD policies and security provisions aren\u2019t ubiquitous, but companies will have to get on the dime if they want to sidestep the dangers inherent in informally managed BYOD. Both companies and employees will need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/trade-offs-age-context-john-mcclurg\">understand and set policies to manage data securely<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This is only going to grow in importance as employees begin to bring other devices to work, and not just smartphones and tablets. When corporate information can find its way to smartwatches, augmented and virtual reality gear, or other connected devices, we\u2019ll have to expand the purview of BYOD policies.<\/p>\n<p>Consider the recent concerns about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/09\/20\/magazine\/barbie-wants-to-get-to-know-your-child.html\">\u2018Hello Barbie\u2019<\/a>, a doll that can listen to conversations, upload the audio to a server with AI capabilities to interpret them, and then to respond intelligently. The basic idea seems appealing, superficially. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to have a doll that can talk with your child, and \u2018get to know them\u2019, quote unquote. But it winds up in creepyville, when such a toy could be building a profile of your children\u2019s interests. Or simply archiving a record of everything it hears your child say.<\/p>\n<p>So even something as apparently utilitarian as an Amazon Echo in the lunchroom, that listens to requests and queues up music, poses some of the same security questions as a smartphone in a confidential meeting.

At present the technology is focused on the language used in human resources, to help improve job descriptions, for example.<\/p>\n<p>The firm is applying artificial intelligence (AI) to \u2018understand\u2019 what goes on in job descriptions, and to guide those writing the descriptions to better achieve the company\u2019s hiring goals. In the example above, the phrase is geared to attracting higher-quality female candidates, based on the qualities we associate with \u2018love\u2019 and \u2018passion for learning\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>The company is planning to expand the targets of the Textio AI to other domains, and it\u2019s HR tool is in use by leading tech firms already. All very interesting. But the thing that caught my eye in the Xconomy article was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.xconomy.com\/seattle\/2015\/12\/16\/with-new-funding-textio-trains-machines-to-improve-hr-writing\/\">this<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><i><b>Textio tracks language and other document attributes, looking for patterns that correlate with increased applications and applications that lead to screening interviews, as well as language that is more likely to attract male and female applicants. \u201cTextio recognizes 50,000 distinct phrases that change the number, quality, and diversity of candidates who apply,\u201d [founder Kieran] Snyder wrote in a November blog post. \u201cThe list of effective phrases is changing constantly as the market shifts.\u201d<\/b><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><b>For example, name-checking \u201cbig data\u201d in an engineering job listing just two years ago attracted significantly more applicants. Today, however, job listings that include that now-clich\u00e9 phrase perform an average of 30 percent worse than those that leave it out. Meanwhile, the phrase \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d has come to the fore in the strongest-performing tech job listings during the last six months.<\/b><\/i><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Wait a minute: big data is now clich\u00e9? I was surprised to read that.<\/p>\n<p>A little research brought other information to light, that suggests that AI is eclipsing <a href=\"http:\/\/lt.dell.com\/lt\/lt.aspx?CID=286157&amp;amp;amp;LID=5477257&amp;amp;amp;DGC=SM&amp;amp;amp;DGSeg=GEN&amp;amp;amp;RED=301&amp;amp;amp;DURL=http:\/\/www.dell.com\/learn\/us\/en\/04\/business-intelligence-big-data\">big data<\/a> as a hot field of inquiry. As more companies have invested in big data initiatives they are wising up to the idea that data \u2014 even when there is a great deal of it \u2014 is passive. It\u2019s not the data that has value, it\u2019s the analytics that matters. That means we aren\u2019t in a big data economy, but an algorithmic, machine learning, or AI economy. That\u2019s where we are likely to get real leverage.<\/p>\n<p>And that\u2019s why even in 2014, I\u2019ve come to find out, big data credentials had already started to drop in value, as reflected in a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.datanami.com\/2015\/03\/06\/big-data-job-market-unexpectedly-cooled-in-2014\/\">Foote Partners report:<\/a><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><i><b>According to Foote\u2019s survey of more than 200,000 IT workers in the U.S. and Canada, pay premiums for 31 noncertified big data skills (such as Hadoop, MapReduce, Hbase, Hive, NoSQL, data mining, and base SAS) fell an average of 3 percent in over the second half of the year, but still ended up slightly for the year, thanks to healthy gains from January to June. Pay for 37 big data certifications (such as those from Cloudera, MongoDB, Teradata, and others) grew more than 10 percent for the year, but lost some value as the year went on.<\/b><\/i><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Basically, it seems like \u2018big data\u2019 is becoming \u2018data\u2019, full stop. The \u2018big\u2019 is becoming superfluous, and the analytic side is where the heat is. And we\u2019ll see the greatest returns on tightly focused analytics. As Shawn Rogers, Chief Research Officer, <a href=\"http:\/\/lt.dell.com\/lt\/lt.aspx?CID=286157&amp;amp;amp;LID=5477257&amp;amp;amp;DGC=SM&amp;amp;amp;DGSeg=GEN&amp;amp;amp;RED=301&amp;amp;amp;DURL=http:\/\/software.dell.com\/products\/statistica\/\">Dell Statistica<\/a>, recently <a href=\"http:\/\/insidebigdata.com\/2015\/12\/08\/big-data-industry-predictions-2016\/\">said<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><i><b>One could already argue that the ROI of advanced analytics is highest when applied to targeted, vertical market use cases. This will continue to be the case in 2016 and beyond, with manufacturing \u2013 particularly regulated manufacturing \u2013 leading the way. Advanced analytics platforms will be increasingly relied on not only to uncover insights that help optimize processes, but to verify and validate those insights in accordance with regulatory requirements.<\/b><\/i><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>That pragmatic insight into where we will see near-term gains can be balanced with more global and strategic notions. Kevin Kelly, the founding editor of Wired wrote a visionary piece that I often refer back to, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.com\/2014\/10\/future-of-artificial-intelligence\/\">The three breakthroughs that have finally unleashed AI on the world<\/a>. He makes the case that AI will become our generation\u2019s electricity, writing \u2018AI will be supremely boring, even as it transforms the Internet, the global economy, and civilization. It will enliven inert objects, much as electricity did more than a century ago\u2019. But he also points out this boring stuff will be the wellspring of much future innovation:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><i><b>There is almost nothing we can think of that cannot be made new, different, or interesting by infusing it with some extra IQ. In fact, the business plans of the next 10,000 startups are easy to forecast: Take X and add AI. This is a big deal, and now it\u2019s here.<\/b><\/i><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Yes, and now it\u2019s here. And it is showing up in the hiring data at US companies, where AI skills are commanding the premium that big data know how used to.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>This post was written as part of the Dell Insight Partners program, which provides news and analysis about the evolving world of tech.

For me, the epiphany came just as I turned into my driveway; how fortunate that I was moving very slowly at that point, as it was a bobby dazzler of a thought.<\/p>\n<p>Insight often comes through one of three routes: aggregation, extrapolation or conversation (for the record the last is often the most useful but the most risky, due to its anecdotal nature). Aggregation comes from quantitative research; extrapolation from analysing trends and, in the parlance, looking at where the hockey puck is headed.<\/p>\n<p>In my experience, two kinds of extrapolation exist. The first is shorter-term, based on seemingly sudden changes in the business or demographic landscape. Right now, for example, everyone is going digital, mobile, social and so on. And the sharing economy is in full swing, based on the valuations of Uber, AirBnB and the like.<\/p>\n<p>Such waves tend to overlap with, and overtake each other, each wave revealing new winners and sending others crashing into the rocks. Behind such shorter-term changes however, are relatively glacial forces of technology evolution, each continuing on its well-trodden path.<\/p>\n<p>For example Moore&#8217;s and Metcalfe\u2019s laws, driving miniaturisation and the network effect, each of which has had such a global impact over the past few decades. While such principles may eventually reach their logical ends, they have a way to run before their impact recedes &#8211; the Internet of Things is the most recent consequence.<\/p>\n<p>As they continue, it is they that create and destroy whole businesses. The sharing economy has emerged due to cloud-based information sharing capabilities, creating a cookie cutter of opportunities to link suppliers with consumers. The resulting businesses are symptoms of where technology is at today.<\/p>\n<p>But technology continues, regardless, becoming easier and more open. Inevitably, the ability to link trusted parties will commoditise, becoming a feature of the platforms upon which we increasingly depend. \u201cSharing\u201d is something we will just do, as it becomes as straightforward to borrow a book or a shovel as to offer a lift.<\/p>\n<p>Any new technology startup has an opportunity to benefit from a massive pool of potential difference as it short circuits traditional business models \u2014 simply put, making things cheaper for people while operating at lower cost than traditional businesses. Once such opportunities are plugged however, they become part of the landscape.<\/p>\n<p>This means, however successful a young company might be (I\u2019m looking at you, Uber) it has limited time with which to establish itself. This means either becoming a new platform (move over, Amazon, Google and Facebook) or being subsumed, potentially at massive profit to the original founders \u2014 in which case, job done.<\/p>\n<p>But it would be a mistake to see any such business as the shape of things to come.

The company has also developed an iOS app, which I haven&#8217;t had a chance to fool with, yet.<\/p>\n<p>Here you see a\u00a0screenshot (courtesy of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.onlinesocialmedia.net\/20141002\/smart-skin-for-gmail-prioritizes-email\/\">OSM<\/a>), showing four columns.

Here the user has defined &#8216;To Do&#8217;, &#8216;Follow Up&#8217;, and &#8216;Deals&#8217; boards. The items in the boards are nominally Sortd tasks, which are created by either dragging an email from the inbox, or creating a task in one of the boards by clicking the plus sign (&#8216;+&#8217;) at the foot of one of the\u00a0boards.<\/p>\n[My goal in this post is to discuss the concepts motivating Sortd&#8217;s design, and so I will leave my quibbles in square brackets, so they can be filtered. In this case, I think the plus sign should be at the top of the list, so it doesn&#8217;t drop out of sight when the task list grows long.]\n<p>Tasks that start out as an email inherit their name from the email subject, but can be renamed. Tasks can have email(s) added, so a task &#8212; in both cases &#8212; can include a variety or emails from various people. This is an interesting alternative to email labels or folders, when you think about it: a collection of emails united by some intention, goal, or activity.<\/p>\n<p>Tasks can have notes, deadlines, and reminders, but there is no real concept of subnotes. Boards can act as projects, but there is no other level of task lists.<\/p>\n<p>The UX allows for dragging and dropping of emails onto tasks, and dragging tasks around to reorder them. And dropping tasks onto other tasks consolidates any attached emails and notes, but does not create subtasks, alas. [This is something that should be remedied.]\n<p>In my personal case, I have defined &#8216;Today&#8217;, &#8216;Soon&#8217;, and &#8216;Later&#8217; boards.

[There should be away to select an existing task, too.]\n<p><strong>Discussion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I like the Sortd approach to melding task management and email right into Gmail. Partly that&#8217;s so that other services offered by Google and others that are integrated into Gmail continue to work, and so that I don&#8217;t have to move to some other client. That also makes trying it out much easier, and likewise for gradually transitioning.<\/p>\n<p>The problems I have are only a few:<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-sortds-task-manageme\" ><p><strong>Sortd&#8217;s task management is relatively immature<\/strong> &#8212; lacking features like subtasks, recurring tasks, multiple notes, bookmarklet, etc. &#8212; is a powerful disencentive. Sortd has not to deepen the offering&#8217;s task model dramatically if it wants to attract people using tools like Asana, Todoist, Wrike, Clarizen, and so on. Creating a bookmarklet, so users can create a task linking to the URL of any web page, is a really easy feature to create, especially since the tool runs as a Chrome plugin already, and this counters to some extent the lack of integration with other tools, presently.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sortd&#8217;s communication model is minimal<\/strong> &#8212; At present, there is nothing like chats, messaging, or comment threads. I&#8217;ve been told that @mention style communication is in the works, presuambly from the existing task notes.<\/p>\n<p>There is no capability for assigning tasks to people, so that effectively limits tasks to personal use. Note that other offerings &#8212; Like <a href=\"http:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/2014\/02\/218523\/\">Streak<\/a> &#8212; have extended the notion of Gmail labels for that enables personal\u00a0emails to be shared among invited users. I bet that Sortd will have to implement something like this for task assignment &#8212; or at least sharing the attached emails as something other than text &#8212; to work.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Skinning has limits, or maybe doesn&#8217;t go far enough<\/strong> &#8212; I like the idea of skins on top of Gmail, but it only goes so far. Why doesn&#8217;t Sortd implement opening one of multiple emails collected in a task as an additional hover panel above the topmost one? Each email could be its own task, with nested tasks and emails. Likewise, as in the task management tool Trello, why don&#8217;t we have &#8216;subboards&#8217; within boards? For example, in my &#8216;Soon&#8217; board, I create tasks that serve just as labels to break up the list of tasks into weeks, like &#8216;&#8212; wo 4 Jan &#8212;&#8216;, meaning &#8216;week of 4 Jan&#8217;. But if boards could be dragged onto boards, this would work better.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I will be tracking the progress at Sortd, which has been around for over a year, but we&#8217;ll have to see if they are pointing their efforts in the same direction as I would like to see.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Email is often characterized as hellish: at best a necessary evil and at worst a monstrous time sink.

For the trend watchers among us, the holiday season also turns out to be the most wonderful time of year to gain some insight into current shopping behaviors. How were <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2015\/12\/23\/retail-technology-trends-2015-a-year-of-digital-disruption\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">shoppers shopping this season<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, and what can that tell us about the year ahead?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>A rise in online (and mobile) shopping<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It\u2019s not surprising that e-commerce is continuing to grow its share of the shopping experience, with mobile\u2019s role increasing. According to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/software\/marketing-solutions\/benchmark-reports\/black-friday-report-2015.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">IBM US Retail Black Friday report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, more traffic was generated from mobile devices than desktop on Black Friday, driving a 30% increase in sales via mobile devices compared to the previous year. Cyber Monday told a similar story; <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.adobe.com\/news-room\/pressreleases\/201511\/113015AdobeDataCyberMondaySales.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Adobe data<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> showed that 49% of shopping visits could be attributed to mobile devices. This is both an opportunity and challenge for retailers; they\u2019ll need to ensure their properties are optimized to engage and convert mobile users while also exploring new incentives to drive traffic to brick and mortar locations. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Shopping starts earlier; fragments <\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And while Black Friday and Cyber Monday have long served as the groundhog-like indicator for holiday sales, there are signs of a shift. A <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mediapost.com\/publications\/article\/260850\/google-data-suggests-shopping-moments-replace-blac.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Google\/Ipsos Media CT study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> indicated that shoppers are starting earlier; in 2014, 61% began gift research before Halloween and 48% completed shopping by Cyber Monday. This may be a reflection of increasingly fragmented shopping driven by m-commerce; the same study showed that marathon shopping excursions are giving way to spare time shopping on mobile devices. In 2016, retailers will need to employ year-round top-of-mind strategies in order to capture more of those shopping moments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What we\u2019re buying<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There was no shortage of buzzworthy gadgets in 2015, but did that buzz translate to sales? While there are some discrepancies in the estimates around Apple Watch\u2019s overall sales, recent data from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/corporate.bestbuy.com\/best-buy-cyber-week-deals-start-today-doorbusters-still-available\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Best Buy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> stated that customers purchased twice as many wearables this year compared to the 2014 holiday season. That 100% increase is notable, but also suggests that the true Wearable Revolution has been postponed until at least 2016.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"background: #eeeeee;\">This post is sponsored by Samsung. All thoughts and opinions are my own.<br \/><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Meanwhile, other gadgets experienced a few bumps in the sleigh ride leading into the holiday season. Citing safety concerns, the Federal Aviation Association established a registration policy for drone owners, for which non-compliance could result in a fine. Hoverboards (more accurately known as \u201cself-balancing scooters\u201d) aimed for explosive holiday growth, but some were removed from shelves as it became evident that the self-balancing scooters were at risk of, yes, exploding. While both still made a strong presence under the tree, both <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/black-friday-shoppers-bought-electronics-2015-11\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Adobe and IBM\u2019s data<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> showed that Samsung TVs ranked as the most popular purchase on Black Friday 2015. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The wallet goes mobile, sort of<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Consumers had multiple point of sale payment options to choose from this holiday season as the mobile wallet wars heated up. Despite the intensity of the battlefield, however, a <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.infoscout.co\/black-fridays-payment-method-showdown-how-did-mobile-wallets-fare\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">study from InfoScout<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> showed single-digit activity in this area. Credit cards, in comparison, accounted for 79% of in-store payments, making mobile payments another entry into the \u201cmaybe next year\u201d category. Noting that younger generations will drive growth in this area, <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.emarketer.com\/Article\/Mobile-Payments-Will-Triple-US-2016\/1013147\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">eMarketer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> projects a 210% increase in mobile payments in 2016. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Social commerce debuts<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The pressure to monetize social media is on for both brands and platforms, and so 2015 saw a push for social commerce. Designed to usher social networkers down the path to purchase, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest promoted their respective \u201cbuy buttons\u201d in 2015. Still, while some brands and users experimented with the option, there was not yet a groundswell of activity in social commerce. Like mobile payments, the buy button needs a little more time to heat up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This holiday season showed us that consumers are developing a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2015\/11\/25\/3-ways-small-businesses-can-leverage-in-store-mobile-shopping\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">mobile shopping habit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, one that may have a measurable impact on brick and mortar traffic and sales in 2016, but other trends will take a little more time to hit the mainstream. For social commerce, it remains to be seen how easily users in a social mindset can be converted to buyers, but brands (and the platforms that support them) are motivated to monetize the critical channel. Mobile payments have the opportunity to gain a lot of ground in 2016, as long as providers continue to educate shoppers and assuage obstacles like security concerns. While change won\u2019t happen overnight, it\u2019s very likely that by this time next year we\u2019ll see a notable increase in items (perhaps wearables and safer hoverboards) purchased in non-traditional ways. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><!-- bitly for promotion: http:\/\/bit.ly\/1PKtBqo --><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We\u2019ve made it through that time of year again, when consumers struggle to manage busy schedules, tightening budgets and the pressure to&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87833663,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[383371,359222061,4325,359215952,359256358,1508],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/940986"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87833663"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=940986"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/940986\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=940986"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=940986"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=940986"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":940983,"date":"2016-01-06T01:00:34","date_gmt":"2016-01-06T09:00:34","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/?p=248626"},"modified":"2016-02-25T13:38:25","modified_gmt":"2016-02-25T21:38:25","slug":"thinking-differently-about-digital-signage-draft","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/01\/06\/thinking-differently-about-digital-signage-draft\/","title":{"rendered":"Thinking differently about digital signage"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Screens, it seems, are everywhere these days. Printers and watches, tablets and smartphones all have high-resolution digital displays; front rooms and shared spaces across the globe are being furnished with increasingly large monitors. It\u2019s a consequence of the relationship between increasing fabrication quality and falling prices, reducing what might be called the \u2018threshold of suitability\u2019 \u2013 simply put, the point at which deploying a screen becomes cost effective.<\/p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, this model is not only affecting <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2015\/08\/27\/digital-displays-are-reshaping-broadcast-sets-for-the-era-of-audience-engagement-video\/\">broadcast media<\/a> but also retailers, sports and entertainment venues, hospitals and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.higheredtechdecisions.com\/article\/3_things_college_campuses_should_consider_when_deploying_digital_signage\">university campuses<\/a>. Sometimes the need can be quite simple: for example, consider the use of digital screens to show up to date bus times at transit points. Doing so saves a not-insignificant amount of rigmarole, from printing and distributing timetables, to maintaining a list of what has been updated where.<\/p>\n<p>Once such a facility is in place it can serve as a basis for additional features \u2013 in this case, pushing out service changes or problems, serving adverts, updating the bus location in real time or even reporting emergencies. A screen is also just one step away from being an interactive terminal, accessible via a smartphone, watch or other device.<\/p>\n<p>Screens can scale up, and scale out. In terms of size the sky is the limit, as images can be projected onto entire buildings. With the right back-end infrastructure in place (i.e. systems that co-ordinate what is being displayed), screens can also be spread across a campus environment and updated, to all intents and purposes, <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2015\/08\/12\/digital-signage-in-higher-education-keep-your-campus-informed\/\">simultaneously<\/a>. In practice, this means that any surface, pillar or wall can be a location from which information can be shared.<\/p>\n<p>It also means that organisations could benefit from thinking differently about digital signage. In general screens and display acquisitions are considered on a capital or project basis \u2013 back with the bus stop example, the shopping list probably said \u201cscreens to display timetables etc.\u201d Given the broadening opportunity both in terms of where to display, what to display and indeed, how to interact, an advisable alternative is to broaden horizons in terms of what this makes possible.<\/p>\n<p>In practice this starts with a quite simple thought experiment. Look at the environment around you and think, \u201cWhat if every surface was able to deliver information, in any form? How would this change how I consumed information, if I was a student, a patient, a customer? What kind of relationship would I be able to have?\u201d While this may seem to be a step too far (\u201cAll we wanted was a display\u201d), it is not that different from design of a space \u2013 architects do not consider the lowly footpath in terms of linking two points, for example, but as an opportunity to create new, unthought-of routes.<\/p>\n<p>There remain numerous practicalities to keep in mind \u2013 connectivity, software integration and aspects such as <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2015\/12\/01\/a-tale-of-two-screens-getting-high-brightness-digital-signage-right-infographic\/\">screen brightness<\/a> in certain locations, as well as cost-benefit analysis of the specific business case. But even if the outcome of a given deployment of digital signage is going to be relatively limited, it would be wise to include an element of up-front brainstorming in any discussion such that the full potential of any investment can be realised.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re interested in learning more about the evolving digital signage industry, watch\u00a0our first webinar sponsored by Samsung titled \u201c<strong>Business on Display: Making a Statement with Digital Signage<\/strong>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"680\" height=\"383\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/E_eFJZgoqFQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><!--http:\/\/bit.ly\/22Vx5xC --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Screens, it seems, are everywhere these days.

But that&#8217;s one of the trends we are witnessing. And the relationship between Amazon and Ford &#8212; or any other permutation\u00a0of the formula &lt;Internet Giant&gt; + &lt;Automobile Manufacturer&gt; &#8212; is deeply imbalanced because of the relative velocity of the two players. So we can imagine that the destabilizing impact of this relationship will shake the Automobile Manufacturer into its constituents, and anywhere that the Internet Giant is strong will be taken over by them.<\/p>\n<p>In this case, imagine a few years down the line when a car is even more of a hardware commodity than it is now, and where you will select the &#8216;carware&#8217; based on how well it integrates with your &#8216;homeware&#8217;. Say I am a big fan &#8212; and buyer of &#8212; Amazon&#8217;s smart home products, and not invested in Apple, Google and Microsoft alternatives. Amazon\u00a0provides my\u00a0critical UX, stores all my data, and the various devices integrate &#8216;seamlessly&#8217; and complement each other well. So I may choose a Ford the way that people choose a Mac, Dell, or Microsoft\u00a0tablet\u00a0today, first choosing the OS and then the device.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a scenario that Ford provided to Geekwire as an example of the interaction through Alexa:<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-owner-%e2%80%9calexa\" ><p>Owner: \u201cAlexa, ask my Ford for my scheduled car start time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Alexa: \u201cHere is the list of your current go times. You have a start time set for Monday at 7 a.m., with a cabin temperature set to 85 degrees Fahrenheit. Tuesday at 5:45 a.m., with a cabin temperature set to 75 degrees Fahrenheit.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Owner: \u201cAlexa, ask my Ford for my car\u2019s driving range.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Alexa: \u201cYou have an available range of 56 miles.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In that scenario, Ford&#8217;s investment in proprietary on-board communications technology will turn out to be something like the Palm OS: a dead end in smart device operating systems. I will think of the Ford as another Alexa device, like my Fire TV Stick or Echo. I won&#8217;t care who manufactured the device. In fact, it could be branded Amazon, and built in Shenzhen by jobbers following an Amazon (or Apple, Microsoft, or Google) design.<\/p>\n<p>However,\u00a0the smart home-centric model isn&#8217;t the only model we are seeing at work. Consider <a href=\"http:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/johanabhuiyan\/lyft-driverless-cars#.anNnNyJW3w\">the news from General Motors<\/a> which is investing $500 million in Lyft, the Uber competitor. GM announced last year that it plans to deploy a &#8216;fleet&#8217; of autonomous Chevy Volts by the end of this year, so it has seen the decline in car ownership accelerating in the future, and want&#8217;s to get ahead of it.<\/p>\n<p>Millennials are much less car oriented than earlier generations, and the cost savings of car &#8216;sharing&#8217; &#8212; or fractional availability, are huge: connect the dots, and you see imminent revolution in carland.<\/p>\n<p>Cars spend <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.com\/2015\/03\/the-economic-impact-of-autonomous-vehicles\/\">95% of their lives parked<\/a>. Leaving aside the ecological and city planning aspects of that waste, the cost equation of fractional car availability &#8212; or\u00a0sharing &#8212; will trend toward very low car ownership when all falls out. If GM wants to have a dominant role in the future economics of cars, they need to broaden their economic participation because there will be much fewer car purchases, and more miles on the meter per car.<\/p>\n<p>They are hoping to become Lyft, or Uber, or the like, while operating as a car manufacturer in the meantime. Good luck. That&#8217;s the kind of self-renewing straddle that incumbents find so hard to accomplish. Will they be willing to accept Amazon-sized minuscule profits and plow profits back into disrupting their markets faster than others &#8212; like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft &#8212; will be doing?<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s an easier bet to say that Uber &#8212; and maybe Lyft, although they are facing strong headwinds &#8212; might start building their own cars, and get out ahead of the auto companies, just like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft will. The brand value will come from those defining the most unique aspects of the product, and that won&#8217;t be automotive: it will be the user experience. You might choose a future Uber over a Lyft because it integrates better with your smart phone, not because of the seats or steering.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A few news stories make it clear that the venerable automobile industry is going to wind up sliced, diced, and consumed\u00a0by the&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2184122,"featured_media":920977,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[2375067,71772,359216142,359234200],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920976"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2184122"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920976"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920976\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920977"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920976"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920976"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920976"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":940982,"date":"2016-01-04T07:38:59","date_gmt":"2016-01-04T15:38:59","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/?p=248627"},"modified":"2016-02-25T13:37:23","modified_gmt":"2016-02-25T21:37:23","slug":"why-the-future-of-payments-may-lie-deep-in-the-past","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/01\/04\/why-the-future-of-payments-may-lie-deep-in-the-past\/","title":{"rendered":"Why the future of payments may lie deep in the past"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s that time of year when we take stock, review where we are and try to work out where we are going.

P2P lending organisations such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lendingclub.com\/\">Lending Club<\/a>\u00a0are already moving beyond their social networking roots and adding stronger governance,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/articles\/2012\/12\/14\/why-is-larry-summers-signing-up-with-lending-club.html\">linking<\/a> high net worth with lower risk individuals.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile London-based Transferwise, which <a href=\"http:\/\/uk.businessinsider.com\/how-transferwise-works-2015-1\">enables<\/a> P2P currency transfers between individuals without using banks as intermediaries, has been valued at a <a href=\"http:\/\/uk.businessinsider.com\/transferwise-58-million-andreessen-horowitz-2015-1\">billion dollars<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Payment mechanisms are also becoming more affordable and, therefore accessible.\u00a0As we have seen, Near Field Communication (NFC) payments via cards and smartphones are giving people <a href=\"https:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/2015\/10\/mobile-payments-go-mainstream-is-it-time-to-say-goodbye-to-the-plastic\/\">confidence<\/a>\u00a0to let go of cash and accept mobile payments.<\/p>\n<p>And in many countries, any small business can buy a card reader terminal for tens of dollars or less, from the\u00a0likes of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/webapps\/mpp\/emv\">Paypal<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/squareup.com\/emv\">Square<\/a>, supporting chip card or NFC\u00a0payments.<\/p>\n<p>A third trend is how\u00a0cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin continue to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mining.com\/web\/33-signs-that-bitcoin-growth-isnt-slowing-down-in-2016\/\">rise<\/a> in popularity.\u00a0Due to their system of record, Blockchain, cryptocurrency payments can take place without involving banks, inviting new models for purchasing goods and services \u2014 not least <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hypebot.com\/hypebot\/2015\/07\/bitcoin-and-music-an-interview-with-artist-and-composer-zoe-keating.html\">music<\/a> and arts.<\/p>\n<p>So what does any of this mean? Most importantly, as costs reduce and confidence increases, so the lower limit on transaction size drops. We are unlikely to see the death of cash any time soon, but small change may become a thing of the past.<\/p>\n<p>Acceptance of smaller electronic payments also encourages the rise in minimal-cost services (such a, for example, the individual play of a song). And while traditional cash has a minimal measure, cryptocurrencies operate at sub-cent levels, further enabling micro-payments.<\/p>\n<p>As well as seeing a growth in such services, we also need to watch out for the potential for micropayment misuse, for example for currency laundering or fraudulent provision \u2014 if a service is offered for a ha\u2019penny then fails to deliver, few would bother to make a complaint.<\/p>\n<p>We will also, inevitably, see the creation of new intermediaries which offer a layer of governance and trust on top of payment mechanisms. Many are vying for this position, from service providers and handset manufacturers to old and new financial institutions.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, a new ecosystem is already evolving. Santander,\u00a0JPMorgan, UBS and Barclays are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/2\/eb1f8256-7b4b-11e5-a1fe-567b37f80b64.html#axzz3v3CxIu2z\">looking into<\/a> Blockchain, and Transferwise is in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/cms\/s\/0\/a963fca6-a59f-11e5-a91e-162b86790c58.html#axzz3v3CxIu2z\">talks<\/a>\u00a0with traditional banks about adding a P2P currency exchange feature to their mobile banking apps.<\/p>\n<p>The consequence is of improved flow of money. This is both a blessing and a curse as it yields market unpredictability, as various trading disasters in recent years serve to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/crowded-trades-collapse-1449194923\">illustrate<\/a>. Technology also brings its own risks \u2014 not least, it can be buggy or insecure.<\/p>\n<p>Overall however, less friction makes for more efficiency, meaning that the payment mechanism reduces in importance compared to the products or services we are selling or buying.<\/p>\n<p>Currency was never meant to become more important than the things that we do with it, but over the last couple of thousand years it has become so.\u00a0While we may never go back to a system of barter, our\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/oldestcoins.reidgold.com\/article.html\">experiment<\/a> with currency may well be moving back to its proper place.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s that time of year when we take stock, review where we are and try to work out where we are going.&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87746169,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[51541356,359256358],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/940982"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87746169"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=940982"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/940982\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=940982"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=940982"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=940982"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920925,"date":"2015-12-31T13:47:44","date_gmt":"2015-12-31T21:47:44","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920925"},"modified":"2015-12-31T13:47:44","modified_gmt":"2015-12-31T21:47:44","slug":"the-headset-cometh-a-virtual-reality-content-primer","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/12\/31\/the-headset-cometh-a-virtual-reality-content-primer\/","title":{"rendered":"The headset cometh: A virtual reality content primer"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>When we talk about VR, we tend to talk in broad strokes. &#8220;Experiences,&#8221; we call them, as if that term is somehow covers and conveys the depth and disparity that exists between gaming, watching, and interacting with VR content. The reality of virtual reality, however, is not so easily categorized or described.<\/p>\n<p>VR content is the big blanket term that clumsily and imprecisely covers large and vastly divergent portions of the content market as it stands. VR games, immersive video, and virtual cinema all fall under &#8220;VR content&#8221;, but they&#8217;re fundamentally different experiences, possibly appealing to very different portions of a potential mainstream VR market.<\/p>\n<p>Let me get this out of the way: the Samsung Gear VR, Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and Sony Playstation VR systems that are coming en masse in Q1 2016 are wildly dissimilar creatures. From hardware to headware, these headsets have commonalities (gyroscopes, accelerometers, lenses) but result in very different experiences, namely with respect to resolution, frame rate, quality of the image, type of content supported by each headset. But alas, that&#8217;s another story, which we&#8217;ll save for another time.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re here to talk about VR content and what there is to do in a headset. Who is VR for and why does it exist? What does VR content look like, where does it come from and end up, and why should anyone want to strap something the size of small(ish) camcorder on her face?<\/p>\n<p>Right now, most VR content falls into two distinct (if broad) categories: video and games.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s no secret that a large portion of the early adopter market for VR headsets will be made up of gamers, but gaming is really only part of the story. We&#8217;ll get to it, but first let&#8217;s take a look at the sleeping giant of VR content: video.<\/p>\n<p>For the time being, video in VR also pretty much falls into two categories: immersive video and virtual cinema. Video, for the purposes of this discussion, is any bit of content that you experience in a VR headset during which your degree of agency is limited to where you&#8217;re looking.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, whether it&#8217;s immersive or passive, in video content, you can&#8217;t control your or interact with your environment directly or physically. In some cases, you may be able to explore it by looking around, but your impact on the world is limited to changing your own perspective. Gaming and interactive content, by way of contrast, is content that allows you to affect and interact with the environment around you, whether its via gaze-based mechanics or controllers of any kind.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"immersive-video\">Immersive Video<\/h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ll admit that the first time I saw Paul McCartney in concert, I cried. Paul&#8217;s my favorite Beatle, the mastermind behind most of my favorite Beatles songs (including and especially Fool on the Hill), and seeing him live, right in front of me was, to put it simply, breathtaking.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, I wasn&#8217;t actually there. I was watching it in a VR headset, from a much better vantage point than any seat could hope to provide. I was right next the piano. If I&#8217;d been any closer, I&#8217;d have been sitting on the grand piano right in front of him. He was playing Live or Let Die which, while not one of my favorites, was incredible. There was no moment at which I felt just exactly like I was right there in the stadium, surrounded by thousands of people and whisper-distance from Paul McCartney. But then, I also forgot that I wasn&#8217;t right there. And that&#8217;s what VR is all about.<\/p>\n<p>Immersive video content comes in a number of different forms, though it all stems from the same general principle: putting you into the story or the action.<\/p>\n<p>Companies like Jaunt, Vrse, WEVR, Discovery, and even Jeep and Volvo are creating immersive video content. Right now, for both Cardboard and Samsung Gear VR, there are a number of apps and short video experiences that put you anywhere from in the audience at SNL to in a wetsuit, diving into and exploring a shark-riddled shipwreck. There are VR tours of museums and stunning locations, heart-pounding skydiving, flying and racing experiences, and human-centric stories and short films.<\/p>\n<p>Discovery VR is Discovery&#8217;s foray into the world of VR and immersive video, and features a number spherical video tie-ins with Discovery Channel IPs like Mythbusters, Gold Rush, Shark Week, and Survivorman. With immersive video, the team behind Discovery VR is experimenting with VR as a new way of telling stories.<\/p>\n<p>On the other end of the immersive video content spectrum is WEVR, the VR software company recently on the receiving end of a big ($10M big) investment from HTC (makers of the Vive headset). WEVR is an open platform VR ecosystem with agnostic software solutions, and it&#8217;s looking &#8220;enable a content explosion,&#8221; in the words of co-found and CEO Neville Spiteri.<\/p>\n<p>Conal Byrne, Discovery&#8217;s SVP of Digital Media and one of the leads for Discovery&#8217;s VR project calls virtual reality, &#8220;the first medium where you can turn a fan or a viewer into a character by just placing them smack-dab in the middle of the story.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And really, that&#8217;s what lies at the core of immersive video: presence.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You need to think about the audience as being in the experience,&#8221; says WEVR&#8217;s Spiteri. &#8220;You&#8217;re not just a viewer\u2026we use the term &#8216;visitor&#8217;.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Though the idea of creating video around a viewer instead of in front her may seem simple, the effect it has on the way we tell stories is nothing short of ground breaking. &#8220;With that simple change,&#8221; says Byrne, &#8220;to be in control of your POV as you watch video&#8211;it&#8217;s a seismic change.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Beyond presence lies another, much more illusive component of immersive video: storytelling. Right now, VR is new and novel, but there will come a time when strapping on a headset and looking at a sunset may come to feel commonplace&#8211;something like looking at a beautiful photograph. Enjoyable, stunning even, but somehow stagnant. The compelling element of any video, any experience, is the story. Immersive video will eventually develop and evolve to stretch the boundaries of storytelling, and that presents some exciting opportunities tempered by some very real challenges.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;360-degree video or &#8216;capture-based VR&#8217; where you&#8217;re starting with some aspects of the real world,&#8221; says Spiteri, &#8220;is proving to be very compelling and creating opportunities for ways of creating and telling video-based stories that have different degrees of interactivity.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Requiring complex multi-camera\/lens rigs, sophisticated editing software, and a team of people who understand the complexities of capturing all 360 degrees of a scene, creating immersive real-world video content is a difficult task. But of course, creating immersive video is much more complex than simply setting up a multi-camera rig that has the technical capabilities to capture 360-degree video.<\/p>\n<p>Creating immersive video content requires recognition that everything around, above, and even below will be captured on camera. Everything is in frame and it&#8217;s all a part of the story, and the viewer is going to have the freedom to consume all of it. It&#8217;s all a part of the story, even if the action is only happening in a small or partial portion of the scene.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;With traditional storytelling, the director has a pretty high degree of control over what you&#8217;re looking at,&#8221; says Spiteri. &#8220;The art of drawing the user&#8217;s attention and directing gaze becomes pretty fundamental to the story and the storytelling process.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>While much attention is given to capture and edit systems, fancy and rugged rigs, and perhaps one of the most crucial factors of storytelling in VR has nothing to do with technology at all. Instead, it&#8217;s entirely human.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We want to make sure that humans don&#8217;t get lost in the mix,&#8221; says Byrne, &#8220;that storytellers, journeymen, pioneers, the people that bring stories to life\u2026don&#8217;t get lost.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In discussing the lush forest-based Survivorman experience on Discovery VR, Byrne says, &#8220;It&#8217;s one thing to shoot a 360 shot of that forest off the grid in Canada, but when [Survivorman&#8217;s] Les Stroud steps out of that forest and starts talking about what he loves about being off the grid and why he does what he does, teaching survival to the viewer, it takes on a whole other meaning and comes alive.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Like my experience with Paul McCartney, the human element is essential. Who you find in the scene and what they have to share is every bit as important as where you are when you put on the headset.<\/p>\n<p>One of this year&#8217;s most stunning examples of immersive video, however, comes from Oculus Story Studio, and features not a human, but a hedgehog. Henry is a short film that follows Henry the hedgehog as he embarks on a journey to find friends.<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/134754691\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\"frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Henry&#039;s Premiere\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Unlike much of the immersive video content that exists and is available right now, Henry is an animated VR short and puts the audience inside of Henry&#8217;s animated world. The visuals are crisp and stunning, but perhaps one of the most stunning elements of the film is the way that Henry behaves within it.<\/p>\n<p>Henry can look at you. Like, right at you. And while it sounds simple, that is a fundamental paradigm shift. This isn&#8217;t just breaking the forth wall, it&#8217;s pulling you inside so that the fourth wall is firmly behind you. Henry&#8217;s world was designed around the you, the viewer, and you&#8217;re a part of it.<\/p>\n<p><!--nextpage--><\/p>\n<p>Though Henry may technically fall under the broad category of &#8220;immersive video&#8221;, it feels an entirely new plane of VR content for which there isn&#8217;t a category. Not yet, anyway. It&#8217;s like a gray area. Anything that allows you to duck and weave and turn and stretch to see things in a virtual environment, and anything that features a character that knows you&#8217;re there and can look you in the eyes (not just in the &#8216;camera&#8217;) goes far beyond just the ability to look around a 360-degree scene.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"virtual-cinema\">Virtual Cinema<\/h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s jump back to the other side of the fourth wall for a moment to talk about the other major form of video content emerging for VR headsets: virtual cinema.<\/p>\n<p>Where immersive video is captured and created specifically for a 360 degree platform, virtual cinema applications like Samsung Gear VR&#8217;s Virtual Cinema and the Oculus Cinema application for Rift allow users to watch existing 2D and stereoscopic video files in a headset.<\/p>\n<p>These videos themselves aren&#8217;t immersive in nature, though. Instead, virtual cinema applications put viewers into a virtual space like a movie theater or home theater. In these applications, the viewer often has a seat placed in front of a screen (which is anywhere from the size of a large home television to an IMAX screen) and given something of a theater-like experience inside the headset. The video plays on the screen and while video isn&#8217;t immersive, the experience is.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say your living room is relatively comfortable. You&#8217;ve got a decent couch, which sits a decent distance away from a reasonably-sized television. Watching films and television is an enjoyable experience, though not often breathtaking. For big, stunning experiences, you go to the theater and pay $14 for a ticket, $6 for popcorn, $3 for a soda and only later add it up and feel ashamed. $23 for a 90 to 120-minute film experience is a lot of money for the opportunity to look at a big screen, surrounded by big speakers and a lot of folks who love talking and their cell phones.<\/p>\n<p>The virtual cinema experience in VR essentially seeks to mimic the experience you might find in a movie theater. The screen feels huge. It feels like a theater screen&#8211;one that dwarfs even your 42&#8243; 4K television. The sound is entirely under your control. If you&#8217;re a wimp like me, you can turn down the volume on a horror movie during the scary parts. Or, if you&#8217;re a big Fast &amp; the Furious fan (also like me), you can take it as a cue to bump up the volume every time Dom says &#8220;Ride or Die.&#8221; You&#8217;re in control of your own theater experience, and it&#8217;s like having the entire place to yourself. No one&#8217;s talking or kicking your seat or texting or &#8220;forgetting&#8221; to turn off the ringers on their phones. If you&#8217;re a grump (like me), this is one hell of a selling point.<\/p>\n<p>Virtual cinema is very different from immersive video, but no less appealing. Being able to replicate the movie theater experience on-demand, for free*, and in the comfort of your own home is an deliverable, and one that may very well change the way that we think about home entertainment.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re sitting in your living room and you can feel like you&#8217;re looking at a screen that&#8217;s the size of an IMAX screen,&#8221; says Spiteri, &#8220;where you literally have to crane your neck upwards to see the top of the screen and you have to pan your head to the left or the right&#8230;That&#8217;s a fundamentally different experience that consumers want and we think that the impact in the living room is going to be very significant.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Studios like Twentieth Century FOX, Lionsgate and Legendary, along with content streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, Vimeo and more are teaming up with headset makers to bring content to a mainstream VR market. Though some of the studios are working with immersive content as a way to develop new experiences around their IPs, they&#8217;re also making video content available in the virtual cinema applications, which is essentially a vote of confidence in the future of VR as a form of home entertainment, and speaks volumes about where VR content might be heading outside of the gaming world.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"gaming\">Gaming<\/h3>\n<p>Much of the talk about VR comes down to gaming, and that&#8217;s because gamers are going to make up the majority of the early adopters. Many game developers have long awaited the arrival of viable virtual reality tech and in turn, the technology behind the games industry is something of a driving force behind VR content. Gaming is leading the charge in content and consumption because gamers understand the dIn many ways, games are and always have been a natural fit for VR&#8211;immersive content made better with interactive elements is powerful and transformative, and that&#8217;s exactly what games will be.<\/p>\n<p>To state the obvious, everything in VR right now is still in its infancy. Though we&#8217;re lightyears ahead of where we were just a year or two years ago in VR, the technology that comes one or two or five years from now is going to look and feel very different from the headsets that we&#8217;re strapping on today.<\/p>\n<p>As such, many of the games that are coming to VR headsets now are experimental in nature. That&#8217;s not to say that they&#8217;re buggy or bad&#8211;not by any means. But the way games are being developed in VR now is with an attitude of innovation. Where console and PC games are mature markets and somewhat known quantities, there are new things to be discovered and implemented in VR&#8211;new game mechanics, new ways to conceive of space and expanse, and new methods for telling stories in-game.<\/p>\n<p>Ustwo Games, the studio behind the hyper-successful mobile game Monument Valley, recently\u00a0released\u00a0Land&#8217;s End, a VR gaming experience for Samsung Gear VR. Land&#8217;s End is gorgeous, with sprawling maps inspired by real-world locations like Iceland and Stonehenge, and employs a gaze-based mechanic that lets gamers play with their eyes. As games like Land&#8217;s End find their way into the world of VR, the way that we use and interact with headsets and content is going to evolve.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"680\" height=\"383\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/XwJ9fiH2Ksw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>The involvement of the games industry in VR content goes beyond simply making games, though. Using tools from the game development arsenal, creators are finding ways to make VR content that steps outside of the world of gaming.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Most virtual reality content is actually being created using tools that were developed by the games industry,&#8221; said Palmer Luckey (Founder of Oculus) in short documentary piece from Unreal. &#8220;And that&#8217;s because the games industry is the only industry with the technology and the tools and the talent to create immersive, real-time 3D worlds.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Already sporting blistering frame rate and rendering capabilities, game engines like Unreal Engine are made to handle the challenges of building immersive 3D worlds and maps, and aren&#8217;t just used for creating games.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When you first jump into VR development, there are a few requirements that become rapidly apparent,&#8221; says Ray Davies, General Manager of Unreal Engine. &#8220;You need a rich rendering feature set to craft compelling visuals for the experience and you must maintain a high level of performance to avoid discomfort. You&#8217;ll also likely need features such as physics simulation and a particle effects system to create worlds that respond in believable ways, and allow you to make truly immersive experiences that take full advantage of the VR platform.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Using Unreal Engine, creators have been able to build complex 3D worlds without having to develop the tools on their own. As gaming and VR have many of the same technical requirements and standards, creators have been able to circumvent the costly and time-consuming process of reinventing the proverbial wheel.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;All of these tools are effectively required for building modern high fidelity games,&#8221; says Davis, &#8220;and we&#8217;ve been refining them through many years of firsthand games development; which means VR developers using Unreal Engine are able to hit the ground running that much quicker. In addition, content creators are able to spend more time exploring what&#8217;s possible in VR instead of having to invest their time building custom tools.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Though games have always been a natural fit for VR, it seems as though the films and games industry are poised to benefit from one another&#8217;s technical and creative tools.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the first industries to flock to VR outside of game development was the film industry,&#8221; says Davis, &#8220;and many teams across the world have already built truly amazing VR storytelling experiences using Unreal Engine. Teams like Oculus Story Studio are tackling the traditional storytelling methods head-on with their pieces like Henry, while other teams, such as Kite &amp; Lightning have created cinematic experiences like Senza Peso to fundamentally explore what is possible with this new medium. For the last several years many game developers were chasing after the high cinematic bar that films were pushing, and it&#8217;s interesting to see how the introduction of VR has changed that around as film creators are looking for more tools to create new types of content on the platform.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"content-evolution\">Content Evolution<\/h3>\n<p>VR content, though impressive and transformative and even awe-inspiring as it may be, is just beginning. In many ways, it&#8217;s only just pulled itself from the primordial muck to become something great. It&#8217;s not unlike moving pictures or talkies or CGI&#8211;what we have now is incredible, and it&#8217;s going to get much, much better.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If people are going to engage with the technology on a longer scale they&#8217;re going to need deeper, more affecting, more human stories to engage with,&#8221; said Vrse CEO Chris Milk in a Q&amp;A with Re\/code. &#8220;We, as an industry, have to be pushing that forward. Otherwise, the floodgates are going to open, the audiences are going to come, and they&#8217;re just going to get through the content very quickly and there will be nothing left.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As VR content evolves, it&#8217;s going to change the way that creators create, the way viewers view, and the way we see everything.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;With a new technology that&#8217;s as exciting as VR,&#8221; says Byrne, &#8220;you can get lost in the euphoria of what it&#8217;s like to use VR for the first time and not sort of take a step back and say, &#8216;how does this change content&#8217;? And I think the answer is probably &#8216;fundamentally&#8217;.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>With better headset technology, libraries full of rich content, and the ability to access incredible experiences on-demand, we may very well see our living rooms evolve right along with VR. After all, WEVR&#8217;s Neville Spiteri points out that the involvement of studios and premium content-makers and IP holders indicates that they&#8217;re beginning to see &#8220;headsets as the next logical evolution of the screen to program for.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The extent to and the ways in which VR will impact our lives remains to be seen, but the headset is coming, and it&#8217;s going to change everything.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When we talk about VR, we tend to talk in broad strokes. &#8220;Experiences,&#8221; we call them, as if that term is somehow&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611562,"featured_media":920969,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359225009,238462220,18949,359215885],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920925"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611562"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920925"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920925\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920969"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920925"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920925"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920925"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920968,"date":"2015-12-31T09:08:45","date_gmt":"2015-12-31T17:08:45","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920968"},"modified":"2015-12-31T09:08:45","modified_gmt":"2015-12-31T17:08:45","slug":"twitter-flip-flops-on-politwoops-again","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/12\/31\/twitter-flip-flops-on-politwoops-again\/","title":{"rendered":"Twitter flip-flops on Politwoops (again)"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Twitter has <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/2015\/holding-public-officials-accountable-with-twitter-and-politwoops\">reversed its decision<\/a> to bar Politwoops, a service which collects and preserves deleted tweets from public officials, from\u00a0using the public Twitter API.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Today we\u2019re pleased to announce that we have come to an agreement with\u00a0The Sunlight Foundation and The Open State Foundation around Politwoops,&#8221; the company said. &#8220;We look forward to continuing our work with these important organizations, and using Twitter to bring more transparency to public dialogue.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Both organizations previously criticized Twitter for attempting to hide what public figures said in public but later recanted by deleting their tweets. Here&#8217;s what a spokesperson for the Sunlight Foundation, which backs the US version of Politwoops, told me when Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/08\/25\/politwoops-shutdown-raises-questions-about-twitters-rules\/\">moved to block the international version<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-to-prevent-public-ov\">\n<p class=\"selectionShareable\">&#8216;To prevent public oversight when our representatives try to discreetly change their messaging represents a significant corporate change of heart on the part of Twitter and a major move on their part to privatize public discourse,&#8217; they said.<\/p>\n<p class=\"selectionShareable\">&#8216;Imagine if the Washington Post printed a retraction of a story, would it demand that all copies delivered to the home with the original story be returned? When a public statement is made, no matter the medium, can it simply be deleted and claimed as a proprietary piece of information?&#8217;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Twitter defended the move by saying that the &#8220;ability to delete one\u2019s Tweets \u2013 for whatever reason \u2013 has been a long-standing feature of Twitter for all users&#8221; and that the company would &#8220;continue to defend and respect our users\u2019 voices in our product and platform.&#8221; Providing\u00a0cover to\u00a0politicians actually helped other\u00a0users.<\/p>\n<p>Now the company has reversed its decision &#8212; the second time it&#8217;s done so where Politwoops is concerned. First it said the tool would be allowed to function on its platform; then it blocked Politwoops&#8217; access to its public APIs; and now it has reversed course so the service can monitor the tweets politicians want to hide.<\/p>\n<p>This flip-flopping makes sense given <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/09\/15\/twitter-and-square-use-presidential-campaigns-to-find-relevancy\/\">the importance of politics<\/a> to Twitter. But, as I wrote when the company shut down the international version of Politwoops, the company&#8217;s\u00a0inability to consistently enforce its rules (let alone uphold certain ideals) is the most\u00a0worrisome part of the back-and-forth between it and the tool:<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-consistent-rules-can2\">\n<p class=\"selectionShareable\">Consistent rules can be lived with and worked around. Inconsistent rules, however, lend some credence to the idea that Twitter might not be wise enough to decide\u00a0what outside groups can do with public tweets. The company should have either shut down Politwoops before or allowed it to run into perpetuity.<\/p>\n<p class=\"selectionShareable\">In a way, it\u2019s a lot like the controversy created whenever Politwoops did catch deleted tweets that\u00a0shamed the politicians who sent them.

As she says in the preface,<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-whether-openly-and-a\" ><p>Whether openly and actively or in subtle, subliminal ways, things talk to us. They do not all speak aloud: some communicate in text, diagrams, and other graphic interfaces; others empathetically and almost telepathically, just keeping us company and storing our memories; still others in sensual ways, with warmth, scent, texture. Objects populate our homes and pur lives; buildings and places have identities and characters; cars and airplanes speak and listen; virtual worlds beckon us; London&#8217;s Tower Bridge and artist Maria Abromovic&#8217;s chair even send tweets.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We are living in a world of increasingly talkative objects, objects that listen, text, and tweet. This is a growing trend, and one which will lead to a major impact on technology user experience, and ultimately, how we think about and interact with the world and each other.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>In the deluge of year-end future predictions, I have been observing one consumer trend that I believe will rapidly muscle its way into the business context: talking. When I say we will be talking more in 2016, I don&#8217;t mean that people are going to be making more phone calls &#8212; and writing less email &#8212; in 2016. I&#8217;m thinking of voice, and talking to increasingly smart devices that are appearing on the market.<\/p>\n<p>Today I received a press email about Otko, which is a smart ring that communicates with smart\u00a0devices, and allows you to take a call by tapping the ring and then\u00a0cupping\u00a0your hand &#8212; and the ring &#8212; over\u00a0your ear.<\/p>\n<img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/static1.squarespace.com\/static\/56433fd3e4b081513da8fa2f\/t\/565712c7e4b06b23bf1544b9\/1448547017768\/okto+man+with+ring.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" \/>\n<p>You can then leave your phone in your pocket or bag,<\/p>\n<p>Alternatives to the ring are various sorts of &#8216;earables&#8217;, like the Bragi Dash, a bluetooth noise-cancelling pair of wireless earbuds that work in tandem with smart phones and tablets as a touch-activated voice and audio solution.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/bragi_dash_black_model_03.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-large wp-image-248617\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/bragi_dash_black_model_03-804x590.jpg\" alt=\"bragi_dash_black_model_03\" width=\"600\" \/><\/a>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/bragi_dash_black.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-large wp-image-248618\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/bragi_dash_black-804x448.jpg\" alt=\"bragi_dash_black\" width=\"600\" \/><\/a>My experience is that wearing earbuds &#8212; even the best designed ones &#8212; can lead to ear pain, so for the long haul a smart ring looks like a better solution. On the other hand (so to speak) noise cancellation has a great attraction. I&#8217;m starting to imagine having both sorts of devices and using at different times in different contexts. And when will Apple get into the game?<\/p>\n<p>But over and above the obvious talk-talk-talk with earables and smart rings fronting for our phones, what about talking with apps, services, and artificial agents?<\/p>\n<p>This past year I &#8216;spoke&#8217; a great deal with an artificial agent, an &#8216;AI&#8217; called Amy Ingram that has been working as a virtual assistant making appointments for me. I don&#8217;t talk to Amy, though: she&#8217;s reachable only through email, which is probably the best medium, considering that most of the negotiation around setting appointments starts and ends with email. In Amy&#8217;s case, all I have to do is cc her on an email, and add some guidance like &#8216;Amy &#8211; Can you schedule a time for Carla and me to talk next Wednesday or the week after?&#8217;. She picks up the thread with Carla, and I can step aside. Later on I receive an invitation to an event, or an email from Amy letting me know something&#8217;s gone wrong. I figure that Amy is saving me hours of email tag per week: she&#8217;s become indispensable. And yes, I would like to be able to text and talk with her, too.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook&#8217;s Messenger is moving in that direction with M, their answer to Google Now, Siri, Cortana, and Alexa. And since its introduction in mid 2015, M is getting four times as many &#8216;social mentions&#8217; as any competitor, presumably since it is embedded in Messenger.<\/p>\n<p>And I expect to see a parade of other ai-enabled assistants like Amy (or Andrew, if you&#8217;d rather a male assistant) to support us\u00a0in other domains, like travel planning. Travelocity founder Terry Jones is at work on <a href=\"http:\/\/wayblazer.com\/\">WayBlazer<\/a>, a solution that is leveraging IBM&#8217;s Watson technology to help with travel planning. Personally, I&#8217;d be happy with something that just knows how to make plane reservations on my behalf, and to get me aisle seats if possible.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon Echo is likely to become one of those iconic innovations that comes to define a product category, and in this\u00a0instance, Echo looks like the form factor for the home hub that many are trying to emulate.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Screen-Shot-2015-12-30-at-12.50.06-PM.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-248619\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Screen-Shot-2015-12-30-at-12.50.06-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-12-30 at 12.50.06 PM\" width=\"600\" \/><\/a>\n<p>Or is it the underlying Alexa technology, which is a competitor to Siri and Cortana? I&#8217;ll be trying Alexa out in a slightly different package later this week, when my new Amazon Firestick arrives. Apparently I will be able to use voice commands\/interaction with Alexa on that device when plugged into my TV.<\/p>\n<p>The distinction between this form factor and the Echo is more about location. My TV is in the living room and far too large to move to the kitchen, while I think of the Echo as a kitchen-first object.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll report more on that experience in the weeks to come, and about smart rings and ear buds as I start to acquire them.<\/p>\n<p>But the simplest bet to make is that these tools &#8212; especially the wearables &#8212; will be rapidly moving into the workplace. About that, more to follow.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;ve been slowly digesting Talk to Me, the collection of essays edited by Paola Antonelli (of MoMA) over the holidays.

Established players are experimenting with new services to maintain their relevance, upstart messaging companies are doing their damnedest to knock incumbents off their thrones, and people have more options than ever before when it comes to connecting with other humans.<\/p>\n<p>Below I&#8217;ve tried to think up some of the changes we&#8217;re most likely to see in 2016 as companies try to diversify their products, renew competition with their rivals, and make good on some of the things forecasted by changes made this\u00a0last year. And, this being the holidays and all, I decided to do so in a handy-dandy listicle.<\/p>\n<p><b>Facebook Messenger learns from Asian services<\/b><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For social in 2016 I think we will see a further entrenching of messaging and it will have a more important role in personal communications, especially in mature markets such as the US,&#8221; Gartner analyst Brian Blau told me. &#8220;As the top messaging platforms extend their functionality it will open the door to third-parties and businesses who will want to leverage messaging [as] one of their next platforms of choice when [it] comes to connecting with their customers.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve already seen this <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.fb.com\/news\/2015\/12\/introducing-transportation-on-messenger\/\">with a recent update<\/a> that allows Messengers users to hail a ride through Uber without ever having to leave the communications app. The company was key to stress that this is just a test available to a limited number of users in the United States, and that Uber is just its\u00a0first transportation partner, but it&#8217;s clear that Facebook plans to start expanding Messenger&#8217;s capabilities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Snapchat works on its relevancy to the news cycle<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve already said Snapchat&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ibtimes.com\/snapchat-san-bernardino-story-shows-networks-entry-breaking-news-2209169\">introduction to breaking news<\/a> during\u00a0the San Bernardino shooting on December 2 <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/12\/08\/snapchat-entering-the-breaking-news-business-could-be-a-good-thing\/\">was\u00a0refreshingly different<\/a> from most coverage. The app&#8217;s ephemeral nature, combined with the fact that Snapchat&#8217;s coverage was based almost entirely on content shared by its users, made it a useful tool that provided a close look at what happened on the ground that day.<\/p>\n<p>It wouldn&#8217;t be surprising if Snapchat followed this early success with other news efforts. Perhaps it could help news organizations find content on its network to share with their audiences via Discover. (Anything would have to stay within the Snapchat ecosystem to preserve its impermanence and the privacy of its poster.) Or it could just\u00a0repeat its approach to covering\u00a0San Bernardino\u00a0in other places.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pinterest stops dancing around its commerce ambitions<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Many tech companies\u00a0don&#8217;t worry about making money. They know that if they have reach enough people, and convince enough venture capitalists that they could make money as soon as they decide to flip a magical switch that could eventually rake in millions of dollars, they don&#8217;t really need to do anything else. But, eventually, investors start to expect companies to bring in some dough.<\/p>\n<p>Pinterest could do that next year. The company has been flirting with commerce since it introduced &#8220;Buyable Pins&#8221; in the beginning of the year. It&#8217;s since added a <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/03\/pinterest-introduces-a-dedicated-shop-to-open-users-wallets\/\">dedicated shopping section<\/a> to its mobile applications, introduced a search tool that makes it <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/09\/pinterest-introduces-a-new-visual-search-tool\/\">easier to discover goods<\/a> within photos, and, most recently, updated the Buyable Pins so they can tell people <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.pinterest.com\/en\/save-little-your-holiday-shopping\">when\u00a0items shown\u00a0in them<\/a> drop in price.<\/p>\n<p>All that&#8217;s left is for the company to ask for a cut of those revenues. Perhaps it will continue to indirectly profit for a while &#8212; advertising revenue ain&#8217;t bad &#8212; but eventually it wouldn&#8217;t be a surprise if it started to make money when people buy stuff they discovered on its platform. In fact, it would be the opposite: I would be more surprised if this didn&#8217;t\u00a0happen than if the flip were switched next year.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Twitter introduces a competitor to Facebook&#8217;s Instant Articles<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s weird that Facebook beat Twitter to content hosting. Sure, Facebook sends more traffic to publishers, but many people use Twitter as a content discovery service. It would&#8217;ve made sense for Twitter to introduce something that makes opening a link, especially in the company&#8217;s mobile applications, less painful than it is. (In-app browsers never seem to function particularly wonderfully.)<\/p>\n<p>Given that, it wouldn&#8217;t be a surprise if Twitter at least attempted to offer a similar tool to publishers. It might not have as much success &#8212; Facebook&#8217;s efforts have succeeded in large part because it has more users, more control over the links they see, and more advertising options &#8212; but it could still give it a try. Otherwise it&#8217;ll be ceding one of its core strengths, content discovery, to its rival.<\/p>\n<p><b>Celebrities and brands keep testing features before the public<\/b><\/p>\n<p>It seems like one of the nicest things about being a celebrity, aside from the fame and the money and the prestige, is the ability to test new features before the unwashed masses ever hear of them. (And by &#8220;unwashed masses&#8221; I mean &#8220;we.&#8221;) That will probably remain true for two reasons: Giving a feature to celebrities naturally limits its reach, and access could keep celebrities engaged with a site.<\/p>\n<p>Just look at how Facebook rolled out new features. Perhaps the most notable example is the service&#8217;s live-streaming tool. It debuted first among celebrities; then made its way to other public figures; and <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/12\/03\/facebook-expands-live-streaming-tool-tests-new-sharing-mechanism\/\">is finally being tested<\/a> among a small number of Facebook users in the United States. This gave celebrities an interesting feature while also helping Facebook make adjustments to the tool.<\/p>\n<p>There was also the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.sfgate.com\/techchron\/2015\/09\/02\/twitter-tested-new-photo-tools-during-the-vmas\/\">the photo-editing features<\/a> Twitter gave to celebrities before anyone else. And it&#8217;s not just celebrities: features often debut early among brands, too, so their ads\u00a0can stand out from other content on the services.\u00a0<span style=\"line-height: 1.5\">&#8220;With Instagram\u00a0specifically, there are quite a few\u00a0features they&#8217;ve offered brands that will likely make their way to users too,&#8221; said Jackdaw Research&#8217;s Jan Dawson. &#8220;Account switching, multiple-photo carousels, being able to link externally, and so on are all features users want and which might well show up in 2016.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Facebook introduces\u00a0video-streaming apps<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve said\u00a0this already, but it&#8217;s worth repeating here: Facebook&#8217;s lack of standalone video apps is bizarre. The company has done everything it can to take over users&#8217; phones by taking features from its main\u00a0services\u00a0and giving &#8217;em their own apps. Messenger was part of Facebook. So <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/12\/14\/facebook-to-make-photo-syncing-feature-exclusive-to-moments-app\/\">was the ability to synchronize photos<\/a> across devices, which is now exclusive to Moments. Facebook likes independent apps.<\/p>\n<p>Combine that with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2015\/11\/4\/9671708\/facebook-videos-8-billion-views-per-day\">how popular video has become<\/a> on its service and it seems like only a matter of time before we start seeing these apps on our phones, tablets, and set-top boxes. Facebook will soon become a channel similar to YouTube or Netflix or Hulu.

People also use them more each year.

Because it&#8217;s often grown indoors, and growing it legally is just becoming legal in a few states around the country, the\u00a0plant is almost\u00a0begging to be messed with. And, if those experiments go well, they could affect more than just Mary-Jane.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s according to Fluence, a startup that builds LED-based lighting systems for legal cannabis growers and partners with researchers to study their impact. Want to know if a particular strain of marijuana grows best under one spectrum instead of another? Or how much money could be saved by switching from incandescent lighting systems to LEDs? Fluence wants to be the company to ask.<\/p>\n<p>The company, which was formerly called BML Horticulture, currently has to run all these experiments from a research lab in California &#8212; and rely on data from other growers and researchers &#8212; because its home city of Austin <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thecannabist.co\/2015\/05\/12\/texas-marijuana-austin-pot\/34780\/\">isn&#8217;t the most pot-friendly<\/a> place in the nation. (The company could relocate, but right now it&#8217;s content with keeping an eye on\u00a0everything with\u00a0remote monitoring systems.)<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We view this as just another plant. We&#8217;re looking at all crops that are considered high-value crops or crops that can better humanity, whether that&#8217;s lettuce, other types of leafy greens, or cannabis,&#8221; said chief executive Nick Klase. The company focuses on marijuana production because that&#8217;s where the money is, he said but it wants its research to affect other aspects of agriculture, too.<\/p>\n<p>Most of its cannabis-related research is meant to figure out how to grow more crop while using less electricity than other lighting systems. A <a href=\"http:\/\/www.technologyreview.com\/news\/528646\/weeds-chronic-energy-use-becomes-a-concern\/\">report from 2014<\/a> said that\u00a0growing marijuana accounted for $6 billion of the country&#8217;s\u00a0electricity cost throughout the year. Installing more efficient LED lighting systems could have a tremendous effect on the amount of energy used\u00a0by these operations.<\/p>\n<p>But Fluence wants to figure other things out, too. Klase told me that the company is experimenting to see if different colors of light affect plant growth, for instance, or if they promote the production of specific\u00a0desirable compounds. &#8220;Our goal is to better humanity with this technology, so obviously that&#8217;s going to extend way beyond cannabis,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The nice thing is that most of the things effective on cannabis is relatable to other crops.&#8221; Sounds like a dream, right?<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no denying the interest in growing plants other than marijuana inside. Countless <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/SB10000872396390443855804577602960672985508\">reports<\/a> have <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ibtimes.com\/indoor-farming-future-takes-root-abandoned-buildings-warehouses-empty-lots-high-rises-1653412\">talked<\/a> about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/articles\/2013\/05\/07\/vertical-indoor-farms-are-growing-in-the-u-s.html\">indoor<\/a> agriculture and how it&#8217;s become more popular in the last few years. This is because it&#8217;s seen as more\u00a0efficient; because people are interested in buying locally-grown produce; and because indoor farming might offer a solution to problems wrought by climate change.<\/p>\n<p>It just seems to make sense, right? If tech companies make efficient LED lights, and it&#8217;s going to get harder to farm in many parts of the world, why not play god and grow something that might not otherwise succeed in a particular area? As it turns out, there are many reasons. Economics might be the most important to growers. There&#8217;s also the effect these operations could have on the environment.<\/p>\n<p>Louis Demont Albright, a professor emeritus of biological and environmental engineering at Cornell University, <a href=\"http:\/\/news.cornell.edu\/stories\/2014\/02\/indoor-urban-farms-called-wasteful-pie-sky\">cites both factors<\/a> as the main obstacles to indoor farming.\u00a0&#8220;Just in today&#8217;s economic climate, if you buy enough light to raise wheat, you spend $18 for a loaf of bread just for the electricity for the wheat,&#8221; he said. Farmers won&#8217;t be able to handle\u00a0those costs\u00a0without assistance.<\/p>\n<p>All that light would also require growers to use electricity to power their lighting systems and the air conditioning used to prevent the whole thing from going up in flames. (That is not, as I understand it, what cannabis enthusiasts\u00a0refer to as &#8220;lighting up.&#8221;) This would, according to Albright, have a worse effect on the environment than growing in greenhouses to take advantage of natural light.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The idea that&#8217;s being proposed is a production system that increases the carbon footprint by an order of magnitude,&#8221; Albright said in an interview, &#8220;and it makes no sense to me that you would solve a problem by making it worse.&#8221; According to his research it&#8217;s actually better for the environment to bring\u00a0produce in from around the world than it is to grow it locally with large-scale indoor farming.<\/p>\n<p>Albright isn&#8217;t the only one who thinks that indoor agriculture might be wasteful. Some cannabis growers have even realized that growing all their crops indoors isn&#8217;t sustainable from a financial perspective. Here&#8217;s what\u00a0Utah State University professor Bruce Bugbee <a href=\"http:\/\/www.technologyreview.com\/news\/528646\/weeds-chronic-energy-use-becomes-a-concern\/\">told MIT Technology Review<\/a> in the same report that covered the electricity used in the process of growing marijuana plants indoors:<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-eventually-as-growin\"><p>Eventually, as growing marijuana becomes more accepted, some farmers may turn away from grow houses altogether. &#8216;I\u2019ve visited growers in Colorado who\u2019ve grown cannabis for 30 years and have always grown it indoors,&#8217; Bugbee says. &#8216;The most progressive growers have run the numbers, and instead of warehouses they\u2019re starting to build greenhouses.&#8217; The plants may still be sheltered, but they\u2019re open to view\u2014and to the natural light of the sun.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>There&#8217;s no denying the effect climate change will have &#8212; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nclimate\/journal\/v5\/n2\/full\/nclimate2470.html\">and has already had<\/a> &#8212; on agriculture. And it&#8217;s the human way to think that technology can save the day. But if these professors and the many other researchers who agree with them are believed, indoor agriculture won&#8217;t be the panacea that some expect it to be. It&#8217;s more likely to be a short-term\u00a0solution that will exacerbate a long-term\u00a0problem.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think agriculture will move. Wheat may move from Kansas or wherever up into Alberta if it gets a few degrees warmer,&#8221; Albright said. &#8220;But it&#8217;s still going to be grown on the land.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Marijuana is a natural candidate for experimentation &#8212; and not just the kind that leaves New York Times columnists in hallucinatory states&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611561,"featured_media":920960,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359234199,586,4483661,359234198],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920942"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611561"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920942"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920942\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920960"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920942"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920942"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920942"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":940988,"date":"2015-12-29T06:00:12","date_gmt":"2015-12-29T14:00:12","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/?p=248611"},"modified":"2015-12-29T06:00:12","modified_gmt":"2015-12-29T14:00:12","slug":"a-new-retail-model-for-a-new-class-of-devices","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/12\/29\/a-new-retail-model-for-a-new-class-of-devices\/","title":{"rendered":"A new retail model for a new class of devices"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Heading into CES I\u2019ve been thinking about all of the connected consumer devices flooding the market, some of them from established manufacturers like Whirlpool, many more crowd funded experiments in hardware design. It\u2019s that second group\u2014the droves of folks with bright ideas, like connected bike locks and smart water heaters, that could improve our lives, but which essentially exist outside of standard retail channels.<\/p>\n<p>One of the core issues with all of these products that are effectively being developed by small businesses is that there\u2019s no way to get the products into the hands of customers. Shelf space in retail electronics stores is a precious commodity, reserved for products that represent large revenue drivers for big box stores.<\/p>\n<p>But perhaps a larger issue with where we are in the evolution of consumer IoT products is that there is no way to get many of these products into the hands of consumers so they can try them, so they can see why connectivity might make a difference in their user experience, and then make the purchase. We operate on the assumption that everything can be sold via eretailers. And it can. But I still think in store experiences help, particularly in the early stages of a product launch.<\/p>\n<p>On December 11<sup>th<\/sup>, b8ta launched in Palo Alto. Founded by<a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/12\/09\/four-nest-alums-are-opening-a-retail-store-to-sell-trendy-tech-gadgets\/\"> a group of ex Nest employees<\/a>, b8ta is a small (1400 square feet) physical store that features approximately fifty of the most exciting products in IoT. You can walk in, give that smart thermostat or connected light bulb a spin, and see if it\u2019s for you.<\/p>\n<p>If the prevailing response to the ecommerce revolution among brick and mortar retailers has been to create experiences for customers ala Tesla and the Apple Store rather than sell goods, b8ta represents the epitomy of such a strategy. Come in. Try. Play. Learn about connected products.<\/p>\n<p>The problem, of course, is that stores need to sell goods and not everyone\u2019s a tech darling like Apple and Tesla. And while I\u2019m curious to see how well b8ta is able to actually move product, what\u2019s even more compelling about the startup is its business model.<\/p>\n<p>The company has no inventory risk because it takes everything on consignment. It pays its suppliers once sales have been made minus a commission plus monthly subscription fees. B8ta built a software system that allows companies to onboard their product into the system, see where the product is in the store, track sales, as well as access in store iPads that allow companies to control their merchandising by remotely updating the iPad.<\/p>\n<p>Thought of a different way, b8ta is not a store in the way that we think of stores as purely sales channels. Rather, the b8ta store is effectively a marketing platform that gives small business IoT startups a chance to get their products displayed in retail, something that will be nearly impossible for them in the Best Buys and Apple Stores of the world.<\/p>\n<p>Creating experiences for customers is clearly a premium brand type strategy but given that consumer IoT, to my mind, still requires a certain degree of interest in technology on the side of the consumer, this strategy is actually timely. Not to mention the location in Palo Alto is the right demographic to start with.<\/p>\n<p>The other thread that runs through the b8ta store concept is scalability and elasticity, to borrow some of the themes from the cloud, the share economy and really the modern trend in business and consumer behavior. When I spoke with b8ta co-founder Vibhu Norby, he noted \u201cwe needed to be agile enough to be able to ramp up inventory for a really good company, and ramp down for ones that weren\u2019t succeeding.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The ability to provide product manufacturers access to data on sales and give them greater control of their products in store should help them manage their production runs, at least at the early small scale stages. And in a consumer IoT world where hundreds, if not thousands, of connected products are coming and going, a company like b8ta has to be in a position of rapidly moving products on and off its shelves depending on what connects with its customers.<\/p>\n<p>Scalability, viewing retail as an experience, consignment rather than inventory, marketing platform rather than a sales channel. These all represent a new wave of thinking about how consumers and the retail outlets\u00a0serving them need to behave.<\/p>\n<p>And with consumer IoT representing a fundamentally new way that consumers are being asked to interact with the electronics products in their lives, it stands to reason that we might just need a new retail model for a new generation of hardware developers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Heading into CES I\u2019ve been thinking about all of the connected consumer devices flooding the market, some of them from established manufacturers&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87621237,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359235126,359235127,13879,243366],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/940988"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87621237"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=940988"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/940988\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=940988"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=940988"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=940988"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920912,"date":"2015-12-28T10:12:38","date_gmt":"2015-12-28T18:12:38","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920912"},"modified":"2015-12-28T10:12:38","modified_gmt":"2015-12-28T18:12:38","slug":"this-was-the-year-social-networks-turned-into-news-organizations","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/12\/28\/this-was-the-year-social-networks-turned-into-news-organizations\/","title":{"rendered":"This was the year social networks turned into news organizations"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Social networks are the overworked writer&#8217;s best friend. It&#8217;s easy to observe the latest outrage on Twitter,\u00a0grab\u00a0a few good jokes from Reddit, or\u00a0screen cap the ridiculous things people write on Facebook and turn them into blog posts. Writers used to have to find\u00a0stories to chase &#8212; now they just have to be willing to sift through gargantuan\u00a0masses of shit to find a few nuggets of social media gold.<\/p>\n<p>There are a few problems with this: the people whose content has been lifted don&#8217;t always like someone else taking credit for their words, photos, or videos; relying on outside platforms can lead to the meat of a publisher&#8217;s blog posts falling right out of their sandwich of context and witticism; and social networks don&#8217;t need writers to surface their best content. They can collect it themselves.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what many decided to do this year. Reddit created a publication called Upvoted to highlight\u00a0the stories that propagate on its service. Twitter introduced Moments to aggregate tweets about breaking news and entertainment alike. Snapchat got into the news business during the San Bernardino shooting. This was the year social networks tried to establish some control over social media.<\/p>\n<p>The reasoning behind this shift, as well as each company&#8217;s approach to it, has varied. Upvoted resembles a traditional publication that just happens to pull its stories from the Reddit platform. It&#8217;s designed at least partly to redirect some of the traffic that would&#8217;ve otherwise gone to other sites back to Reddit itself. But, <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/10\/07\/reddits-upvoted-is-about-humanizing-the-community-not-just-ads\/\">as Gigaom&#8217;s Tom Cheredar wrote<\/a>, it&#8217;s also meant to humanize the community:<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-right-now-reddit-is-\">\n<p class=\"selectionShareable\">Right now, Reddit is viewed by advertisers with caution. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/business\/la-fi-the-download-reddit-20150714-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">reasons<\/a> for\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/digiday.com\/publishers\/reddit-advertising-business\/\" target=\"_blank\">this<\/a>\u00a0are <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/07\/29\/reddit-plans-to-quarantine-toxic-communities-boost-transparency\/\" target=\"_blank\">well-documented<\/a>. But there\u2019s no denying that Reddit is popular enough that you\u2019d be crazy not to try and get in front of its\u00a0audience. The problem is that it\u2019s often hard to predict how the discussion will form on Reddit by its community, and that\u2019s a risk many advertisers aren\u2019t willing to justify should\u00a0things go sour \u2014 deserved or not.<\/p>\n<p class=\"selectionShareable\">Upvoted can soften those fears by enhancing the top\u00a0submitted content on Reddit proper (as explained above). On other news sites that may credit a Reddit user for submitting a piece of content that gets written up in an article, usually there\u2019s no desire to go beyond the user name. But doing so could help humanize the submitters, which might help advertisers overcome some of the negative characterizations of the overall Reddit community.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"selectionShareable\">Twitter&#8217;s Moments feature (not to be confused with the Facebook photo app of the same name) has a different motivation. It&#8217;s supposed to <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/10\/06\/are-you-not-entertained\/\">find the best tweets <\/a>so people never have to wonder why they should visit Twitter. It&#8217;s also supposed to make it easier for new users to understand what Twitter is about &#8212; a way to distill the chaos into a manageable form so normal people can interact with it.<\/p>\n<p class=\"selectionShareable\">But the implementation is very different from Upvoted. Moments doesn&#8217;t look anything like a traditional publication. Instead it looks like just another feature on Twitter&#8217;s navigation bar, making it harder to tell that <a href=\"http:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2015\/10\/20\/twitter-hires-new-york-times-editor-at-large-for-its-moments-channel\/\">serious editorial talent<\/a>, like New York Times editor at large Marcus Mabry, are in charge of its content. Its team is a dedicated newsroom masquerading as part of the Twitter machine.<\/p>\n<p class=\"selectionShareable\">Snapchat&#8217;s foray into breaking news took yet a different form. Its <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ibtimes.com\/snapchat-san-bernardino-story-shows-networks-entry-breaking-news-2209169\">staffers gathered content<\/a> shared to public &#8220;Stories&#8221; and made them available to anyone near the area affected by the San Bernardino mass shooting of December 2. Small updates about the investigation were written by these same staffers, but for the most part, the company simply shared what its users were experiencing.<\/p>\n<p class=\"selectionShareable\">I <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/12\/08\/snapchat-entering-the-breaking-news-business-could-be-a-good-thing\/\">argued that this approach<\/a>, combined with\u00a0the ephemeral nature of Snapchat&#8217;s service, is a refreshing departure from the majority of\u00a0breaking news reporting:<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-it%e2%80%99s-easy-fo2\">\n<p class=\"selectionShareable\">It\u2019s easy for misinformation to spread on the web. Hitting \u201clike\u201d or \u201cretweet\u201d on a false report doesn\u2019t require much effort \u2014 certainly less than it does to spend a few seconds looking for accurate information or sharing new info as it becomes available. That misinformation often remains until someone goes through and deletes it, which is another opportunity for someone to get the wrong idea about something, share that idea, and keep the perpetual ignorance machine going.<\/p>\n<p class=\"selectionShareable\">Snapchat\u2019s self-deleting updates don\u2019t afford this opportunity. There\u2019s no perpetuity. It\u2019s a bit like talking on the phone with someone: Unless they\u2019ve taken extra steps to record whatever was said, the information is passed along once before it disappears into the aether. The photo-and-video-based nature of the service also lends itself to eyewitness accounts, which limits the claims people can make. (Not that video or photo evidence on social media is infallible.)<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"selectionShareable\">These are three very different approaches, but the underlying goal is the same: Gathering user-generated content before writers aggregate it themselves. So I&#8217;m left to wonder when other social companies will get around to creating their own publications instead of waiting for writers to swoop in, gather all the free content lying around, and turn it into something that could lead to millions of pageviews.<\/p>\n<p class=\"selectionShareable\">There are some obvious contenders. Vine&#8217;s users <a href=\"http:\/\/qz.com\/74703\/vine-finds-its-purpose-in-boston-explosion\/\">already provide a glimpse<\/a> into what&#8217;s happening during important\u00a0events, so it would be trivial for the service to collect the best coverage and make it available to users. The same could be said of Periscope &#8212; instead of showing things in six-second loops, it offers live-streamed video. Twitter could editorialize both services without much effort.<\/p>\n<p class=\"selectionShareable\">Another less obvious one might be Product Hunt. That site is like a gift from the tech journalist&#8217;s gods. (That is assuming tech journalists have gods willing to serve their &#8212; sorry, our &#8212; wretched souls.) Need to find something cool to write about? Go to Product Hunt! It&#8217;s got everything from software to podcasts, and many founders use the platform to answer questions about their products.<\/p>\n<p class=\"selectionShareable\">Talk about manna from tech journo heaven. New products? Public statements? Links to the app store,\u00a0animated GIFs, and ready-to-use images? Product Hunt is one dedicated &#8220;news&#8221; section away from putting a good number of tech writers out of their jobs. Let&#8217;s all take a moment to thank chief executive Ryan Hoover for sparing us from such a grisly end to our careers\u00a0&#8212; at least for the moment.<\/p>\n<p class=\"selectionShareable\">Aggregating content from social networks has created a weird loop that takes something from those networks, puts it on another website, and then inevitably shares it to the same networks and other platforms. (I, and probably many other Redditors, encounter many links to BuzzFeed stories containing jokes I read a week ago.) These efforts are merely the result of social networks closing the loop.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Social networks are the overworked writer&#8217;s best friend.

But, much like its celebration of a record-breaking holiday shopping weekend in November, the company <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/12\/01\/amazons-celebration-of-record-holiday-weekend-sales-is-short-on-details\/\">hasn&#8217;t offered many details<\/a> about its boastful posturing.<\/p>\n<p>The disingenuousness begins with the company bragging that 3 million people signed up for its Prime service in the third week of December. That seems like a victory &#8212; Prime customers are far more likely to remain loyal\u00a0to Amazon than shoppers who don&#8217;t want to pay around $100 per year for access to the service.<\/p>\n<p>But it doesn&#8217;t count\u00a0the number of people who might have signed up for free trials &#8212; Amazon often pushes customers to give Prime a try &#8212; just so they could get free two-day shipping during the holidays. As long as those people cancel within the grace period, all Amazon really did was eat customers&#8217; shipping costs.<\/p>\n<p>Even worse are the boasts Amazon makes about the number of devices it sold or how many people watched something via its streaming video service. Those claims, much like similar ones made after\u00a0Thanksgiving, are represented by percentage increases that never provide a baseline for accurate comparisons.<\/p>\n<p>As I wrote when Amazon pulled the same stunt last month:<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-yet-the-fact-remains\"><p>Yet the fact remains that <a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/12\/01\/lies-damned-lies-and-amazon-holiday-metrics\/\">we have no idea<\/a> what any of this actually means for the company.

How about 42 million? Nobody knows!<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The reliance on percentage increases wouldn&#8217;t be so\u00a0baffling if Amazon didn&#8217;t get rather specific in other areas. The company knows how many timers its Alexa device\u00a0set, the candy bought through its store, and what movie people watched on Christmas. (Over four million, gummy bears, and &#8220;Interstellar,&#8221; respectively.)<\/p>\n<p>Amazon was also willing to share information about the last holiday delivery it made &#8212; enough for anyone close to the person to identify them, provided some of the items were given away as gifts and the recipients happen to stumble across a press release touted by a\u00a0large tech company. Here&#8217;s what Amazon said:<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-the-last-prime-now-o2\"><p>The last Prime Now order delivered in-time for Christmas was delivered at 11:59 p.m. on Christmas Eve to a customer in San Antonio, Texas.

And it&#8217;s based around the idea of communicating with other people which, due to the lens through which we view the Internet, makes it a Facebook competitor.<\/p>\n<p>But\u00a0it doesn&#8217;t matter that Ello wasn&#8217;t meant to compete with Facebook. That&#8217;s how <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/bw\/articles\/2014-10-16\/ello-anti-facebook-social-network-rises-out-of-vermont\">the service was perceived<\/a>, and it was called the &#8220;anti-Facebook&#8221; so much that it became the service&#8217;s tagline in the mind of the general population. (Well, the portion of the general population that reads tech journalism, at least.) It&#8217;s also part of the reason chief executive Paul Budnitz stopped talking to the press.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Someone, somewhere had called Ello a Facebook killer, and there was just all this hype in the news and I had basically every VC in the country trying to talk to me,&#8221; he said in a recent interview. &#8220;For most people that\u2019s really an awesome thing and I guess what every startup wants, but for us everyone was coming for something that I didn\u2019t want to build and we really had no interest in building.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t matter how often Budnitz said Ello wasn&#8217;t taking on Facebook &#8212; the story had taken on a life of its own. Investors were calling with hopes of getting in early with the so-called Facebook killer. Consumers were flocking to the site in search of an alternative to that most polarizing of social networks. And writers, like me, were interested in the company mostly because of a false narrative.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually the press stopped. Ello didn&#8217;t kill Facebook within a few months, its founder wasn&#8217;t giving interviews, and relatively few people used the service. An analyst for App Annie told me that Ello &#8220;essentially is so small it doesn&#8217;t and can&#8217;t compare to&#8221; Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and other established social networks or &#8220;anything that could be defined as an up-and-coming social <span class=\"il\">app<\/span>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Ello wasn&#8217;t even of much interest to researchers. Jason Mander, the director\u00a0of research at GlobalWebIndex, told me Ello was included in just one of the firm&#8217;s quarterly surveys about consumer Internet usage. It\u00a0wasn&#8217;t included\u00a0in following surveys because it was of little interest to\u00a0the firm&#8217;s clients and respondents. Ello seemed to have been forgotten by everyone outside its relatively small audience.<\/p>\n<p>That didn&#8217;t stop the company from continuing its work. I reached out to its press team shortly after I started at Gigaom on a lark. Mostly I expected it to email me every once in a while with a product update, or user data, or the other innocuous things most social networks use to garner attention. It did none of those things. Instead, it sent me the same emails its users get\u00a0about new features or changes.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I\u2019d do these interviews with these really nice people and they\u2019d put this stuff up like \u2018When is Ello going to switch and start running ads?\u2019 and \u2018You\u2019re really not going to go for the billion dollars right now?\u2019 So we just felt like we weren\u2019t getting through the noise,&#8221; Budnitz told me. &#8220;One of the reasons we&#8217;re finally doing interviews is that, if you go on Ello, it&#8217;s actually really, really awesome.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also focused on inspiration, as Budnitz puts it, instead of social networking. People aren&#8217;t using Ello to connect with high school classmates &#8212; they&#8217;re using it to share the images, blog posts, and graphic designs they&#8217;ve made or discovered. All of the company&#8217;s focus over the last year has been on furthering\u00a0that mission and giving users\u00a0a place to connect with like-minded people around the world.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s part of the reason why Ello doesn&#8217;t have ads. Sure, part of it&#8217;s because Budnitz and his co-founders think the way Web ads work <a href=\"http:\/\/mic.com\/articles\/121238\/ello-facebook-ads#.IsPNrq1gJ\">is kind of creepy<\/a>. But the other part is that most advertisements would disrupt the look of the site. &#8220;Beautiful photographs look really crummy next to ads for car insurance and tortilla chips,&#8221; he said. So the company doesn&#8217;t, <a href=\"http:\/\/dealbook.nytimes.com\/2014\/10\/23\/ello-enshrines-ad-free-status-in-its-charter-and-raises-5-5-million\/?_r=0\">and indeed can&#8217;t<\/a>, show ads.<\/p>\n<p>So what is Ello? \u201cThe basic thing that we\u2019ve been building is a safe and positive community where creators publish, share, and eventually sell inspiring work. It\u2019s really a place for people who make things to inspire one another,&#8221; Budnitz said. &#8220;And really it\u2019s not just high-end professionals and designers and all that stuff. I would say we have all types of people, amateurs, professionals, you name it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That positivity is enforced by a full-time support staff, features that give Ello users granular control over who can see what they post, and its small audience. Visiting the site feels less like signing on to a social network and more like stepping into an art gallery where people who don&#8217;t know each other gather around, look at a specific work, and then discuss it in a cool-but-congenial way.<\/p>\n<p>Soon it will be a little different. Budnitz said the company plans to introduce a commerce portion of the service that will allow creators to sell things to other users. It also plans to introduce a version of the site that doesn&#8217;t require people to sign on to view work &#8212; which should go a long way towards increasing its visibility &#8212; and to (finally) release an application for Android smartphones.<\/p>\n<p>But perhaps the biggest change will be the ability for Ello users to post content to other social networks through the platform. This could make it something akin to a central management tool that allows people to share things on Ello first, thus giving them access to what&#8217;s described as a supportive community filled with talented people, before sharing them with the masses on other networks.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our research shows that one of the most popular reasons for using social networks is because people\u2019s friends are on them too. I think that\u2019s why Ello struggled to attract a critical mass, because people tend to join when they perceive lots of their friends to be using the service too,&#8221; Mander said. &#8220;However, multi-networking is widespread. Globally, the average internet user has accounts on over 6 networks (rising to 7 among 16-24s). So, there\u2019s certainly scope for Ello to sit alongside other services, even if its users are still engaging with other platforms too.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Ello has <a href=\"https:\/\/recode.net\/2014\/10\/23\/ello-raises-5-5-million-to-grow-its-ad-free-social-network\/\">raised<\/a> around <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/ello-raises-5-million-2015-4\">$10 million<\/a>, and Budnitz said its team remains small so it can keep costs down. The commerce features will help it monetize. It probably won&#8217;t ever see the kind of success that other networks have (here I go thinking about Facebook again) but it could be a sustainable business. If anything that makes it\u00a0more interesting than if it were an also-ran that died battling Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>The company might never escape the idea that it&#8217;s the anti-Facebook. That&#8217;s certainly the perception I had of the service when I started researching this post. And I&#8217;ll confess that even now the cynic in me can&#8217;t help but wonder if it really was meant to take on Facebook but pivoted once the hype died down. Ello will be fighting this perception for a long time. Budnitz is okay with that. As he told me:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We have time.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Remember Ello, the social network that was first\u00a0portrayed as the anti-Facebook\u00a0well over a year ago?

Along with cheaper compute costs, better (and also cheaper) cloud integration and improved mobile broadband, sensors round out the keys not just to a networked physical world but a world of intelligent machines and machine learning.<\/p>\n<p>So all is hunky dory if you\u2019re a sensor manufacturer? Sort of. On the one hand your unit growth is ticking along at over 11 percent a year, according <a href=\"http:\/\/www.icinsights.com\/news\/bulletins\/Sensor-Shipments-Strengthen-But-Falling-Prices-Cut-Sales-Growth\/\">to one estimate<\/a>. Just look at Samsung. Accelerometers and gyroscopes weren\u2019t enough for their smart phones. They\u2019ve thrown in pressure and humidity sensors.<\/p>\n<p>But on the other hand your average selling price is forecast to fall by 5 percent not just this year, but <em>every<\/em> year for the next five years. Let\u2019s, um, hope your input costs decline.<\/p>\n<p>The trend is driven by intense competition as well as basic commodification of different sensor types. IP appears difficult to lock up in the market. Throw in the reality that many IoT applications require rock bottom pricing and that puts pressure on sensor manufacturers not just to lower prices but also to undercut competitors in the hopes of locking up the market for themselves, Amazon style. The giddiness for consumer IoT has infected sensor makers and no one wants to tell shareholders that they can\u2019t sell sensors to consumer IoT companies when that market is growing.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re thinking consolidation, you\u2019re partially right. There isn\u2019t enough room in this tight market for all the players, but more of what\u2019s going on right now is that companies are looking to bulk up their sensor portfolios through acquisitions.<\/p>\n<p>There have been no shortage of acquisitions. Sensor maker InvenSense\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eetimes.com\/document.asp?doc_id=1323027\">purchase<\/a> of Movea and Trusted Positioning has helped the company with indoor and outdoor navigation as well as motion sensing. In another deal TE Connectivity <a href=\"http:\/\/investors.te.com\/news-releases\/press-release-details\/2014\/TE-Connectivity-Completes-Acquisition-of-Measurement-Specialties-Inc\/default.aspx\">bought<\/a> Measurement Specialties for its sensor portfolios of everything from vibration to ultrasonics sensors. More recently, Sony <a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/10\/08\/sony-buys-gesture-tracker-and-3d-sensor-maker-softkinetic\/\">snapped<\/a> up SoftKinetic for its image sensor technology.<\/p>\n<p>A couple of things are happening. First is that some sensors like gyroscopes are commodified, while others like complex indoor motion sensors are still in the viable IP category. Second, if you\u2019re a company working with product manufacturers you need to be able to offer a suite of sensors.<\/p>\n<p>And so the name of the game going forward is being able to offer a strong portfolio of sensors for customers as a hedge against downward pricing and margin pressure in many segments.<\/p>\n<p>The other market trend on the horizon is integrated modules. Intel\u2019s big consumer IoT announcement at CES of its Currie chip heralded the company\u2019s effort to win over consumer IoT. The module includes not just a 32-bit Intel system on a chip, but also a DSP sensor hub and a 6-axis combo sensor with an accelerometer and gyroscope.<\/p>\n<p>For some IoT product developers there\u2019ll be added value in having sensors packaged with processors and even communications chips (Currie has Bluetooth LE built in). This is all the more reason why I think it\u2019s possible we could see more traditional microcontroller makers going after sensors makers.<\/p>\n<p>So it\u2019s the best of times and the worst of times. If you\u2019ve got a great new sensor with some valuable IP, excellent. If you\u2019re trying to compete on price with commodified sensors, not so much. What\u2019s clear is that for many manufactures in markets ranging from processors to connectivity, making a sensor company acquisition is worth consideration.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019ve written previously about how declining sensor costs are a key facet of IoT.

During those conversations, someone inevitably draws a comparison with service-oriented architecture (SOA) or hesitantly asks the question, \u201cAren\u2019t microservices just SOA?\u201d While it might not seem important on first glance, this is actually a pressing question that gets little attention.<\/p>\n<p>Usually this question is either outright dismissed in the negative or unquestionably accepted in the affirmative. As an exercise in more deeply answering the question, let\u2019s spend time a little time understanding SOA and microservices independently and then comparing.<\/p>\n<p>In the early 2000s, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Service-orientation\">service-orientation<\/a> became a popular design principle. Driven by backlash against highly coupled, binary-oriented systems, service-orientation promised significant increases in flexibility and compatibility. Microsoft\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Don_Box\">Don Box<\/a> was one of the first to truly spell out the guiding principles of SOA, captured in four simple tenets:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">1. Boundaries are explicit<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">2. Services are autonomous<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">3. Services share schema and contract, not class<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">4. Service compatibility is based on policy<\/p>\n<p>By adopting a service-oriented architecture that adhered to these tenets, one could unlock the value in SOA. Very quickly the world\u2019s top software vendors capitalized on the opportunity and began building platforms and technologies to support the concept.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, the SOA movement became almost entirely a vendor-driven paradigm. Vendors scrambled to build middleware to allow developers to build SOA components that could be delivered and managed in the context of those four tenets. That middleware, in many instances, became bloated. Moreover, industry specifications that defined things like SOA schemas and policy management also became bloated. This bloat resulted in heavyweight components and a backlash by developers who viewed SOA as a cumbersome, unproductive model.<\/p>\n<p>In the mid-2000s, cloud infrastructure started gaining steam. Developers were able to quickly standup compute and storage needs and install and configure new applications to use that infrastructure. Additionally, applications continued tackling new levels of scale, requiring distributed architectures to properly handle that scale.<\/p>\n<p>Distribution of components forced segregation of application logic based on functionality. That is, break up an application into smaller components where each component was responsible for specific functions in the app.<\/p>\n<p>This ability to instantaneously call-up infrastructure coupled with the propensity for developers to use distributed architectures prompted individuals to think about formalizing thoughts for a framework. Microservices became a concept that embodied much of this and more.<\/p>\n<p>It would seem that the backstory for microservices satisfies tenets 1 through 3 (although 3 is a bit more relaxed in microservices since a REST API wouldn\u2019t typically be considered a strict contract), making microservices very similar to SOA. So how is that different than SOA?<\/p>\n<p>Microservices, as <a href=\"http:\/\/martinfowler.com\/articles\/microservices.html\">originally conceptualized by Martin Fowler and James Lewis<\/a>, extend expectations beyond how an application is partitioned. Microservices as a pattern establish two other important tenets:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">5. Communication across components is lightweight<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">6. Components are independently deployable<\/p>\n<p>These seemingly small additions to the criteria defining microservices have a drastic impact, creating a stark difference between the microservices and SOA.<\/p>\n<p>Tenet 5 implies that complex communications buses should not be used in a microservices architecture. Something like an <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Enterprise_service_bus\">enterprise service bus (ESB)<\/a> under the hood would create a large, implicit system dependency that would, by proxy, create a monolith of sorts since all the microservices would have one common, massive dependency influencing the functional end state.<\/p>\n<p>Tenet 6 means that deployment monoliths are not allowed (which is something that was common in SOA). Each service should carry its isolation all the way up the SDLC to at least deployment. These two tenets ensure that services remain independent enough that agile, parallel development are not only possible, but almost required. While SOA meant that logic was divided into explicitly bounded components for the same application, microservices\u2019 independent deployability means that the components need to be for the same application at all, and may each be their own independent application.<\/p>\n<p>SOA set the tone for the fundamental architectural concepts embedded in modern microservices, but didn\u2019t go far enough to create a powerful model that would solve the problems associated with bloat and speed of development. Microservices principles have a huge impact in how we think about the software development process and are not just a prescription for the architectural outcome. Thus, microservices can create a better outcome than its SOA predecessor.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sinclair is CEO and cofounder of\u00a0Apprenda, a leader in enterprise Platform as a Service.

They have also got entrepreneurs thinking about other applications for the blockchain technology that underlies them, including ones that address various processes inside non-financial companies such as contracts, audits and shipping. The digital signatures that certify each transaction and the distributed, write-only online ledger that constitute the core of the blockchain tech have the potential to offer even more security in these and other areas than more traditional approaches used by businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Blockchain isn&#8217;t the only game in town either. The Linux Foundation recently\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.linuxfoundation.org\/news-media\/announcements\/2015\/12\/linux-foundation-unites-industry-leaders-advance-blockchain\">revealed<\/a> that it is leading an open source effort to develop an alternative to bitcoin\u2019s underlying tech. The initiative, which has been dubbed the Open Ledger Project, is being supported by a coalition of leading financial services and tech companies, including Wells Fargo, State Street, the London Stock Exchange Group, Cisco, Intel, VMware and IBM. IBM, which has been a driving force behind the project, is reportedly contributing many thousands of lines of code to it as well as considerable developer resources.<\/p>\n<p>The new kid on the block will have some catching up to do with blockchain, which is already being employed in some innovative ways. Nasdaq OMX, the parent company of the NASDAQ stock exchange, wants to use the tech to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/article_email\/a-bitcoin-technology-gets-nasdaq-test-1431296886-lMyQjAxMTE1MzEyMDQxNzAwWj\">oversee trades<\/a> in the stock of private firms and the Securities and Exchange Commission recently approved a plan by Overstock.com that involves the online retailer issuing stock using blockchain technology. Startups such as Digital Asset Holdings and Coinbase are also looking to profit from growing interest in digital tracking and trading using the new approach.<\/p>\n<p>The firms that gain traction here will get plenty of attention. Investment banking firm Magister Advisors <a href=\"http:\/\/www.finextra.com\/news\/fullstory.aspx?newsitemid=28248\">thinks<\/a>\u00a0that financial institutions will be spending a total of over $1 billion on blockchain-related projects in 2017. And finance is just one industry where the new technology could drive significant change. In the music world, startups such as <a href=\"http:\/\/peertracks.com\/\">PeerTracks<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/bittunes.co.uk\/\">Bittunes<\/a> are aiming to use it to revolutionize the way music is bought and shared. And in the art world, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.verisart.com\/\">Verisart<\/a> is harnessing the blockchain to improve the way art is secured and verified.<\/p>\n<p>Looking at enterprise markets, there is a huge opportunity to apply blockchain technology or other variants in any place that involves swaps, trades or exchanges. One of the most obvious applications is in contractual situations where there is a need for proof that various parties are committed to a transaction. Companies such as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blocknotary.com\/\">Block Notary<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/bitproof.io\/\">Bitproof<\/a> are developing ways to bind digital signatures into the blockchain and some firms are also experimenting with the technology to create escrow contracts that hold money on account until mutual agreement is recorded.<\/p>\n<p>Another area where I expect to see more activity using blockchain technology is in auditing. Deloitte is one of a number of professional services firms that is <a href=\"http:\/\/rubixbydeloitte.com\/\">experimenting<\/a> with distributed digital ledgers. Here, transactions can be posted into a blockchain, which would apply a timestamp and act as a repository. Typically, auditors only choose a sample from a set of transactions to check; but using the new approach, it may well be possible to verify a much broader range of transactions securely and cost-effectively. There are a lot of regulatory issues still to be ironed out, but the opportunity to provide certainty with significantly less friction is a compelling one.<\/p>\n<p>There is also a big opportunity to use the technology to improve shipping and supply chain management. An example of a startup here is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thingchain.com\/\">Thingchain<\/a>, which is applying a bitcoin-inspired cryptosystem to multiple use cases, including proving the provenance of goods and who owns them.<\/p>\n<p>Many companies are still learning about the potential of blockchain technologies, so it may be some time before we see broad adoption beyond finance. But the potential is significant\u2014and not only in the areas that I\u2019ve outlined above. Entrepreneurs are already exploring enterprise applications that cover everything from patent registration to recording the results of boardroom votes. Expect to see more and more businesses joining the blockchain gang in 2016 and beyond.<\/p>\n<p><em>Martin Giles is a partner at <a href=\"http:\/\/wing.vc\/\">Wing Venture Capital<\/a> (@Wing_VC).

It will also dramatically change, if not eliminate, the single-person role of Community Manager.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/carriedyoung\" target=\"_blank\">Carrie Basham Young<\/a>, an experienced and respected social business strategist, published a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cmswire.com\/tag\/fbaw-series\/\" target=\"_blank\">series of blog posts on Facebook at Work<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0last week. Her main thesis across these posts was that Facebook is playing a long game in which the line between social interaction in people\u2019s personal lives and at work becomes blurred or disappears altogether. Facebook is betting that it can change enterprise social to more closely resemble the way that people interact outside of work, on Facebook.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Young made many other astute observations in the posts, including,<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Facebook controls the message with respect to its product and the social networking industry in mainstream media<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Adoption (logging in for the first time) does not equal engagement (ongoing, purposeful use)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Facebook at Work is \u201cincredibly easy\u201d to use and may nearly eliminate the need for user training<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Facebook at Work\u2019s extreme end-user focus may cause problems for enterprises, and IT staff at big companies will have a negative view of Facebook at Work until it incorporates enterprise-grade identity management, security and information lifecycle management functionality<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Facebook has the power to change the entire conversation, user expectations and their behavior without input from currently active community managers<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 id=\"changing-nature-of-work-and-or\" ><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Changing Nature of Work and Organizations<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The present (and future) trend in the workplace is toward fewer managers in less hierarchical organizational structures. However, eliminating roles that command others\u2019 work does not equate with getting rid of those who guide and coordinate work. The need for people who can design, facilitate and monitor people interactions within business networks will only increase as authority, responsibility and accountability are decentralized across the employee base of an organization.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If Young\u2019s assessment of the irreplaceable contributions of community managers is correct, then Facebook\u2019s intention to minimize or eliminate them may be a fatal mistake. Instead, Facebook at Work should give all employees access to the tools that Young cites as necessary for successful community management. By doing so, Facebook would accelerate the existing trend of democratizing authority and distributing work ownership. Everyone would be responsible for contributing to the management of communities in which they are members, and stewardship of them would shift contextually.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This vision is not unprecedented. Over the last two decades, Knowledge Management (KM) has moved away from being a top-down activity started and executed by an individual situated fairly high in a company\u2019s organizational chart. Instead, the notion of Personal KM has gained favor, making all employees responsible for creating, capturing, sharing and using knowledge within their company.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It is possible that day-to-day community management will move in the same direction and become a distributed responsibility and activity. Young clearly acknowledged this when she wrote,<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-%e2%80%9cfacebook-wi2\" ><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cFacebook will maintain a pure focus on viral adoption, resulting in an industry-wide slow shift away from the concept of managed communities and toward the concept of ad-hoc, self-driven collaboration as a new normal employee behavior\u201d<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I disagree with Young\u2019s interpretation of Facebook\u2019s goal for Facebook at Work though. I think Facebook seeks to de-emphasize or eliminate community managers, but not community management. It appears that Facebook at Work has been designed for distributed, bottom-up community coordination, rather than top-down, imposed management. (I sincerely hope that Facebook at Work does not intend to have communities ruled by algorithms that decide which topics and interactions are given preference in an employee\u2019s activity stream.) While this will be unappealing to existing community managers, Facebook\u2019s vision for more self-governed collaboration is consistent with the larger trends that are distributing and democratizing work coordination in increasingly flat, networked organizational structures.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 id=\"enterprise-social-will-change-\" ><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Enterprise Social Will Change Sooner Rather Than Later<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Young is right that Facebook at Work will upset the status quo in enterprise social and community management, but I think her timeline is too long. This change is likely to happen in 3 years or less, rather than the 5-10 years she predicts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It will be faster because Facebook can learn from other vendors in adjacent enterprise software market segments, most notably Box and Dropbox in the Enterprise File Sync and Sharing space. Like Facebook, both of those companies began as consumer-oriented services that emphasized user experience over other considerations, including breadth and depth of functionality. Box has since built an offering that meets many of the security, privacy, administration and integration requirements of business customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dropbox has also undertaken that journey, although it did not begin it until well after Box started. That is an advantage in some ways. Dropbox is moving down the learning curve quickly because it has watched Box and learned from its strategic decisions taken and tactical moves made to effect the consumer-to-enterprise shift.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Facebook will do the same, gaining insight from both Box and Dropbox. This will allow Facebook at Work to become enterprise-ready in a fraction of the time that most expect. Watch for Facebook to gradually expand beta access to Facebook at Work over the coming months, then make a version that meets most enterprise requirements generally available by the end of 2016.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It may not yet be generally available, but Facebook at Work is a quickly evolving solution that will change how enterprises think&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87625438,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[31779,69440,359216947,2528,359235131,148433,359235132,359235133,15328,359216724,161492,100866,359235134,16804,264,4236,16917,359235135,359215928,359235136,65391,3457,25716,131],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/940990"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87625438"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=940990"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/940990\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=940990"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=940990"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=940990"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920930,"date":"2015-12-17T08:53:40","date_gmt":"2015-12-17T16:53:40","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920930"},"modified":"2015-12-17T08:53:40","modified_gmt":"2015-12-17T16:53:40","slug":"flipboard-tries-to-keep-publishers-happy-with-profiles-end-cards","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/12\/17\/flipboard-tries-to-keep-publishers-happy-with-profiles-end-cards\/","title":{"rendered":"Flipboard tries to keep publishers happy with profiles, &#8216;end cards&#8217;"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Flipboard is releasing a slew of features to make its content discovery service more attractive to the publishers whose content appear in its apps and website. In doing so, it&#8217;s also indirectly responding to the threat posed by Facebook&#8217;s Instant Articles and other services that find blog posts\u00a0for their users to read.<\/p>\n<p>The first of these features is the ability for publishers to create profiles where all of their content will be posted. Previous versions of the service, which debuted to much fanfare alongside the original iPad, were limited to a series of feeds that had to be discovered via its search tools instead of a single easy-to-find place.<\/p>\n<p>Publishers can manage their profiles with custom logos, designs, and many of the settings that can be tweaked on essentially any platform. Flipboard will also work with publishers to verify these profiles, making it easier to tell if a page is actually run by a paper like the Washington Post or if it&#8217;s managed by impostors.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to these profiles, publishers will now be able to include &#8220;end cards&#8221; that link to their other content in the last &#8220;page&#8221; of their stories. Now, instead of having to worry about readers abandoning them whenever they finish a story, these content providers will be able to at least attempt to keep their interest.<\/p>\n<p>Flipboard&#8217;s head of partner platform products, Jack Mazzeo, said that early tests showed these new end cards increase click-throughs by 15 percent. &#8220;We think publishers will really find that valuable,&#8221; he said, adding that Flipboard wants to &#8220;improve reader engagement&#8221; with the publishers with which it has partnered.<\/p>\n<p>Both of these changes make Flipboard more competitive with Facebook&#8217;s Instant Articles, which <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/facebook-bends-to-publishers-tweaks-instant-articles-advertising-1449676734\">were recently updated with<\/a> similar features allowing publishers to link to whatever content they&#8217;d like at the end of their stories. The new profile pages resemble the central hub for content around which Facebook is organized.<\/p>\n<p>Another change is Flipboard&#8217;s new support for Google Analytics and ComScore. Both are supposed to make it easier for publishers to sell ads against\u00a0traffic in Flipboard&#8217;s mobile applications, which were previously measured by the company and detailed in monthly reports instead of up-to-the-minute updates.<\/p>\n<p>Mazzeo said publishers requested both\u00a0integrations. The update\u00a0is meant to serve two purposes: for &#8220;larger publishers to have more real-time visibility into their traffic on Flipboard&#8221; and for &#8220;smaller publishers who want to understand how much traffic&#8221; they get to decide if they want to invest more in the service.<\/p>\n<p>All of these efforts <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/facebook-bends-to-publishers-tweaks-instant-articles-advertising-1449676734\">follow a report<\/a> from the Wall Street Journal which claimed that the company was &#8220;floundering&#8221; because one of its co-founders left; its ad rates reportedly fell by half; and acquisition talks with Twitter fell through. Chief executive Mike McCue dismissed the report <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/10\/30\/flipboard-mccue\/\">in a later interview<\/a> with Fortune.<\/p>\n<p>That dismissal was echoed by Flipboard spokeswoman Christel van der Boom. During the interview with Mazzeo, she said that the Journal&#8217;s report was based on &#8220;anonymous sources&#8221; and that Flipboard recently had the best quarter in its history. She later said she didn&#8217;t have the exact numbers to back up that claim.<\/p>\n<p>Either way, and regardless of how Flipboard has positioned these new features, it&#8217;s clear that the company is moving past its beginnings as a social aggregator. Is that because Facebook removed the need for apps like Flipboard with Instant Articles, or because the company&#8217;s experiencing a turbulent period in its history?<\/p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t really matter. The result is the same: An experience that relies less on the hodgepodge nature of Flipboard&#8217;s core service and makes the service more like a collection of traditional magazines. It&#8217;s happy. Publishers are happy. Now it&#8217;ll see if users will be happy, too, and that&#8217;s when the real fun will get started.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Flipboard is releasing a slew of features to make its content discovery service more attractive to the publishers whose content appear in&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611561,"featured_media":920173,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920930"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611561"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920930"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920930\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920173"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920930"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920930"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920930"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920929,"date":"2015-12-16T10:18:05","date_gmt":"2015-12-16T18:18:05","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920929"},"modified":"2015-12-16T13:00:51","modified_gmt":"2015-12-16T21:00:51","slug":"googles-self-driving-car-division-to-become-alphabet-company","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/12\/16\/googles-self-driving-car-division-to-become-alphabet-company\/","title":{"rendered":"Google&#8217;s self-driving car division to become Alphabet company"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Google&#8217;s self-driving car division will soon become an independent company under the <a href=\"https:\/\/abc.xyz\/\">Alphabet<\/a> umbrella, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-16\/google-said-to-make-driverless-cars-an-alphabet-company-in-2016\">a report from Bloomberg Business<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Alphabet is <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/08\/10\/google-becomes-alphabet-in-major-restructuring-plan\/\">the corporate behemoth<\/a> Google turned itself into earlier this year so it could have more freedom to experiment with businesses unrelated to the Web without facing pressure from shareholders to monetize the many experiments.

These companies <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/google-parent-to-ask-subsidiaries-to-pay-for-corporate-services-1448325619\">will be expected to<\/a> experiment with new ideas like startups while conducting themselves like real businesses that can&#8217;t rely on venture capitalists to help keep them afloat.<\/p>\n<p>Such a move could motivate the self-driving car division to test\u00a0a ride-hailing service in the cities where its vehicles are allowed to operate. Along with the news about the division&#8217;s looming independence, Bloomberg Business also reported that such a service could debut in cities like Austin and San Francisco.<\/p>\n<p>A service like that would put Google in competition with Uber, which also plans to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2015\/sep\/17\/uber-well-ease-the-transition-to-self-driving-cars\">replace drivers with self-driving cars<\/a>.

It would also make it easier to trust the vehicles not to gather personal information to feed into Google&#8217;s advertising network, give the division more freedom, and let Alphabet expand its growing empire of small businesses.<\/p>\n<p>So I suppose the surprise isn&#8217;t that Alphabet would spin off this division and separate it from Google. That&#8217;s why the restructuring occurred in the first place: To allow Google&#8217;s founders to experiment with new ideas while allowing Google to focus on its strengths.

Suppose you have a question about how to design a product. Which features to add? Which to take away? Where geographically is the product most being used? Normally you\u2019d call in some focus groups, maybe hire a user experience consultant.<\/p>\n<p>But IoT believes all you have to do is <em>Ask The Product.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Much of the drive to add connectivity to consumer products is because the product requires connectivity to operate. If you want to build a learning thermostat you need to aggregate data related to human behavior and run analytics on that data. If you want a smart lock, it has to be connected to a smart phone.<\/p>\n<p>But inherent in this connectivity is the potential to better understand the usage patterns of users and to run analytics at a very granular level. Not only could you track how a smart lighting system is being used, but you could also cross reference that data against age, demographics, gender, usage of other smart home products. The data opportunities suggest not just better product design but significant marketing opportunities or even tailoring of product features for key groups.<\/p>\n<p>Any way you slice it, it would be hard to find a product design team that <em>doesn\u2019t <\/em> want rich data on how their products are beings used, for how long, what times of day, etc. Privacy restrictions will play out here and data may not be available for every company that wants access to it. There are, for example, reasonable concerns surrounding how Google will use all of the home data being tracked on a Nest thermostat.<\/p>\n<p>But whether a company has the ability to track usage data on all their products, they almost definitely can put prototypes in the hands of select users and analyze their usage patterns. Or more likely we&#8217;ll see certain premium features or discounts in exchange for allowing data collection. And this possibility raises the question of whether the value of connectivity is only to enable the product\u2019s operation or if it has become a core part of product development, and what IoT promises companies\u2014the ability to ask the product.<\/p>\n<p>The value of asking the product is probably even more profound in the world of industrial IoT where there are no pesky privacy restrictions and where machines can be tweaked, firmware updated, and redesigned to drive efficiency. For example, in the utility industry, being able to connect a gas or wind turbine, and generate enough data from the turbine to assess where preventative maintenance needs to be performed can result in significant benefits. Even 1 percent efficiency gains in the industrial sector can mean billions of dollars in cost savings.<\/p>\n<p>As with any major technology promise, \u201cAsk The Product\u201d is not bullet proof.

And we send out an insight report the day the breach is identified and then again every week after.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Eastwind also offers context around the breach. Instead of holding information for a few days before trashing it, the company monitors its customers&#8217; data for 200 days to offer\u00a0an idea of what happened before, during, and after a breach. This data is then collected and shown in the weekly reports sent to its customers.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/EWN-dashboard-threatdetection-620.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-920927\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/EWN-dashboard-threatdetection-620.png\" alt=\"EWN-dashboard-threatdetection-620\" width=\"620\" height=\"395\" data-attribution=\"Eastwind\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/EWN-dashboard-threatdetection-620.png 620w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/EWN-dashboard-threatdetection-620-300x191.png 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/EWN-dashboard-threatdetection-620-210x134.png 210w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/EWN-dashboard-threatdetection-620-320x204.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/a>\n<p>It&#8217;s a bit like marrying your high school sweetheart: This person knows what happened before any problems occurred, watched them take place, and will presumably be around to make sure the issue is taken care of.

Eastwind is meant\u00a0to remain constantly vigilant, and its memory is long.<\/p>\n<p>The company has other features that are supposed to differentiate it from its competitors, including a mobile application people might actually want to use; a service that can operate on Eastwind&#8217;s cloud or other tools like Amazon Web Services; and the ability to detect when a breacher has stolen any information.<\/p>\n<p>But perhaps Eastwind&#8217;s greatest strength is that it was built to make it so anyone could use it. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to sit with [leaders of] Fortune 100 companies that have said, &#8216;I&#8217;ve taken the traditional security solution and give it to really smart guys to analyze,&#8221; Kraus said. &#8220;It hurt me to think that a Fortune 100 company would have a monopoly on smart people, or that the problem was so complicated that only PhDs from Stanford or PhDs from MIT could solve it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Eastwind is Kraus&#8217; response to that concern. Its mobile app is designed to be easy for anyone to learn about the health of their company&#8217;s network. Its team was assembled\u00a0to be the &#8220;really smart guys&#8221; behind the service obviating really smart guys. And the company&#8217;s reports are meant to do the thinking for users.<\/p>\n<p>All together, this means\u00a0Eastwind isn&#8217;t going to forget anything that might help it detect a breach, and it\u00a0won&#8217;t\u00a0stop warning its customers about the issue until it&#8217;s been resolved. Maybe these features will be enough to convince the companies responsible for millions of people&#8217;s private data to heed alerts about a threat.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Security tools are only useful if their warnings are heeded.

Mr. Creery and hundreds of fellow drivers in Seattle helped push for the legislation. The hope, he said, is to give drivers more say on how much they should be paid.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The successful vote in the\u00a0City Council means the drivers&#8217;\u00a0organization \u2014 the\u00a0<a title=\"The group\u2019s website.\" href=\"http:\/\/www.teamstertnc.org\/\">App-Based Drivers Association<\/a>\u00a0(ABDA) \u2014 will gain an explicit right to unionize on-demand workers, a first in the U.S. This does not mean that the federal government has agreed, and it would be reasonable to expect that ultimately the National Labor Relations Board or the federal courts might get involved.<\/p>\n<p>Uber, its competitors like Lyft, and a wide variety of other on-demand work companies have their economics squarely based on the premise that on-demand workers are not employees, and as a result, the companies paying them for their labor can sidestep the expenses and liabilities that come with full-time employment, such as insurance, worker compensation, social security contributions, vacation, sick leave, and the like. The on-demand companies clearly benefit from this arrangement, while \u2014 at least in some cases \u2014 the on-demand workers would rather gain the protections and benefits that labor laws in the U.S. provide.

In labor law, there are certain litmus tests to determine whether a supposed contractor is actually a misclassified\u00a0employee. The employer has a strong incentive to claim that the worker is a contractor, because that allows the firm to sidestep taxes, legal liability, and the purchase and upkeep of equipment (like cars, insurance, and gas, in the case of Uber). If the worker is controlled directly by the company \u2014 is told how and when to provide services (like Homejoy\u2019s scheduling appointments instead of its \u2018contractors\u2019 making those arrangements, what tools or equipment to use, and specific procedures to follow (like the Lyft fistbump) \u2014 then misclassification becomes more likely.<\/p>\n<p>Consider the level of control that Handy \u2014 a Homejoy competitor \u2014 applies to \u2018contractors\u2019:<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-ellen-huet%c2%a0cont3\"><p>Ellen Huet,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/ellenhuet\/2014\/11\/18\/contractor-or-employee-silicon-valleys-branding-dilemma\/\">Contractor or Employee?

Again, from\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/report\/handicapping-the-on-demand-market-sectors\/on-demand-on-the-stand\/\">Handicapping On-Demand Market Sectors<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-on-demand-work-has-r5\"><p>On-demand work has risen in the national conscience to the point that presidential candidates are senators are asking difficult questions. Hillary Clinton recently <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/hillary-clinton-takes-aim-at-uber-during-speech-gig-economy\/\">said<\/a>that she plans to \u2018crack down on bosses who exploit employees by misclassifying them as contractors or even steal their wages.\u2019 Senator Mark Warner gave a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/hamzashaban\/on-demand-economy-collides-with-presidential-politics-in-war#.qr0XwzNKk4\">talk<\/a> at a DC-based think tank, New America, in which he supported the idea of a third\u00a0category of worker, saying,<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-for-many-of-these-on2\"><p>For many of these online and contingent workers, they\u2019re operating without any safety net below them.

For example, the half of social security that employers pay for their employees is paid for freelancers, along with the employees half. In a \u2018hours bank\u2019 model, clients would pay a share. So if a freelancer worked 10 hours for company X, they would contribute one quarter of that week\u2019s employer-side social security contributions, and other clients would two.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So, we\u2019ll have to see where this newest detour leads for Uber and the on-demand economy. It seems unlikely that the genie will be chased back into the bottle and that on-demand work will fade away.<\/p>\n<p>However, new protections for the precarious nature of on-demand work obviously need to be put in place, so that the downsides of being an independent worker do not fall solely on the shoulders of the workers, and neither\u00a0should they be socialized by state and federal governments, so that taxpayers wind up subsidizing the on-demand employers. Uber and the other companies that tout their exponential economics will have to return\u00a0some of the 20 to 30 percent they slice out of every transaction, and reinvest that in higher salaries, pensions, and insurance for those making the on-demand economy go, ultimately.

(Specific examples of these problems <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2015\/jun\/03\/facebook-real-name-policy-hurts-people-creates-new-digital-divide\">here<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/morning-mix\/wp\/2015\/02\/10\/online-authenticity-and-how-facebooks-real-name-policy-hurts-native-americans\/\">here<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.salon.com\/2015\/03\/30\/say_my_name_facebooks_unfair_real_names_policy_continues_to_harm_vulnerable_users\/\">here<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>These complaints <a href=\"http:\/\/motherboard.vice.com\/read\/nameless-coalition-petitions-facebook-to-rethink-its-real-name-policy\">led to the creation of<\/a> the &#8220;Nameless Coalition,&#8221; which advocated for Facebook to change its real-name policy to accommodate people who might need to use a &#8220;fake&#8221; name for their own protection or who identify with another name. Dozens of organizations and individuals supported the coalition&#8217;s goals.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook&#8217;s Chris Cox <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/chris.cox\/posts\/10101301777354543\">previously apologized for<\/a> the real-name policy&#8217;s failings and explained that it&#8217;s enforced because it&#8217;s &#8220;part of what made Facebook special in the first place&#8221; and it&#8217;s the &#8220;primary mechanism we have to protect millions of people every day, all around the world, from real harm,&#8221; as he wrote at the time.<\/p>\n<p>Now, the company will require people to provide additional context when they report someone for using a fake name. &#8220;In the past, people were able to simply report a &#8216;fake name&#8217; but now they will be required to go through several new steps that provide us more specifics about the report,&#8221; Facebook said today.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This additional context will help our review teams better understand why someone is reporting a name,&#8221; product manager Todd Gage and vice president of global operations Justin Osofsky wrote in the announcement, &#8220;giving them more information about a specific situation.&#8221;\u00a0And that&#8217;s not the only fix being made.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook will also ask people to explain their situations when they&#8217;re reported for using a fake name. &#8220;People can let us know they have a special circumstance, and then give us more information about their unique situation,&#8221; Gage and Osofsky wrote.

(They can also manually search for businesses in a different area.) Results are shown with review snippets, a star rating, contact information, and the address. It is, in other words, just like Yelp.<\/p>\n<p>Businesses seem\u00a0to be ordered based on the number of reviews they&#8217;ve received. This makes sense for Facebook &#8212; why have something with two reviews as the top result when another business has dozens? &#8212; but it&#8217;s weird\u00a0to see a business with a four-star rating appear far above a business that&#8217;s often given five stars.<\/p>\n<p>Professional Services, as the feature is called, makes sense for Facebook. The company has been trying to become more useful to businesses lately, whether it&#8217;s by introducing the Facebook at Work service\u00a0or allowing them to <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.facebook.com\/blog\/post\/2015\/03\/25\/introducing-messenger-platform-and-businesses-on-messenger\/\">stay in touch with customers<\/a> via\u00a0the Messenger platform, as it diversifies revenue sources.<\/p>\n<p>The surprising thing is that it might actually make sense for Facebook&#8217;s users, too. Even though Yelp has <a href=\"http:\/\/gizmodo.com\/facebook-is-testing-the-yelp-killer-it-shouldve-launc-1748101419\">remained the de facto standard<\/a> for finding businesses, Facebook might have the edge in some cases. I searched for gyms in a nearby city, for example, and Professional Services had many more reviews than Yelp.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook also has the benefit of requiring people to use their real names with their profiles. It&#8217;s easier to trust a review from a friend, acquaintance, or family member than it is to trust anonymous users. You know whether your aunt has wonderful\u00a0taste in hairdressers; you don&#8217;t know the same about XxBoWlCuTsxX.<\/p>\n<p>But\u00a0posting under real names might have its drawbacks. GlobalWebIndex, a firm which regularly surveys Facebook users about their habits, told Gigaom that just 10 percent of respondents to a\u00a0recent survey &#8220;posted a negative comment about a product or brand.&#8221; Reviews could be skewed by\u00a0users afraid to be seen as mean.<\/p>\n<p>This is clearly a quiet test of a potential feature. Facebook never announced that it&#8217;s testing something like this, and a request for comment on this story wasn&#8217;t immediately returned. The company isn&#8217;t yet competing head-to-head with Yelp, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if Professional Services gets more attention soon.<\/p>\n<p><em>h\/t <a href=\"http:\/\/searchengineland.com\/is-facebook-professional-services-facebooks-stealth-project-to-beat-yelp-238430\" target=\"_blank\">Search Engine Land<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook is quietly testing a new feature that allows its users to find &#8220;local businesses with the best Facebook reviews and ratings&#8221;&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611561,"featured_media":920920,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359218214,211455,359216007,359219602],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920918"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611561"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920918"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920918\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920920"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920918"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920918"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920918"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920917,"date":"2015-12-15T06:00:08","date_gmt":"2015-12-15T14:00:08","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920917"},"modified":"2015-12-15T08:06:17","modified_gmt":"2015-12-15T16:06:17","slug":"bing-pulse-engagement-and-research-tool-drops-the-bing","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/12\/15\/bing-pulse-engagement-and-research-tool-drops-the-bing\/","title":{"rendered":"Microsoft relaunches Bing Pulse research tool to go beyond search"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Microsoft is relaunching\u00a0its Bing Pulse audience engagement and market research service to make it clear that it reaches farther than the search engine. The service will now be called Microsoft Pulse &#8212; no relation to the LinkedIn Pulse news app &#8212; in honor of its connections to\u00a0Skype, Yammer, and other tools.<\/p>\n<p>A pilot version of Pulse was\u00a0tested by Fox News during the state of the union address in 2013. The broadcaster used Pulse to ask viewers how they felt about the president&#8217;s speech, analyze the responses, and show them on its broadcast. More than 700,000 respondents voted almost 13 million times in a single hour.<\/p>\n<p>That early success led Microsoft to expand the platform to other broadcasters, teachers, and conference runners, all of whom use Pulse to poll their audiences. Pollsters can use the service, which is connected to Microsoft&#8217;s Azure platform, to get responses from anyone willing to click a link and answer a few questions.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an engagement tool and a surveying tool,&#8221; said Microsoft technology and civil engagement director Dritan Nesho. &#8220;You&#8217;re both solving for the problem that most online polls find of having very low responses, because you have them engaged with a particular form of content, and you&#8217;re collecting that feedback.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The idea is that Pulse can create a feedback loop: Broadcasters solicit opinions via email, social platforms, or on-air callouts; viewers interact with Pulse instead of playing a game or checking their social feeds; and their responses are put on the screen for them to enjoy. It&#8217;s something like a perpetual entertainment tool.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Whenever people are watching a program that&#8217;s being broadcast on TV or participating in meetings and conferences, the majority of them are interacting with their phones,&#8221; Nesho said.\u00a0&#8220;Often times what they&#8217;re doing is veering their attention away onto someone else&#8217;s platform and some other form of content.&#8221; Pulse is supposed to help presenters keep their audiences engaged with them.<\/p>\n<p>Now the tool\u00a0is tied to many of Microsoft&#8217;s other platforms. Skype for Business can be used to solicit opinions from people watching a massive teleconference. Yammer can collect sentiment from a company&#8217;s workers. Microsoft&#8217;s Power BI service can be used to analyze the data. And the Azure platform powers it all.<\/p>\n<p>Hence the relaunch. Much of the service remains the same &#8212; it&#8217;s still free to use, it&#8217;s still connected to Bing, and its core purpose is unchanged &#8212; but rebranding the service gives Microsoft more freedom to continue expanding it. (Nesho said the Pulse team would &#8220;love to be integrated with Xbox very soon,&#8221; for example.)<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our current focus and our current goal is making sure that people start using this product frequently, at scale, and get their reactions to it so it&#8217;s something that becomes part and parcel of their every day activities and becomes useful to their needs for engaging the customers they have,&#8221; Nesho said in our interview.<\/p>\n<p>Dropping the &#8220;Bing&#8221; from the name is just one way for the company to do just that. Sure, it&#8217;s picking up a &#8220;Microsoft&#8221; in the process, but at least then it&#8217;s clear that Pulse is tied into many of the company&#8217;s services instead of seeming like it&#8217;s restricted to the also-ran search engine that never threatened Google&#8217;s throne.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Microsoft is relaunching\u00a0its Bing Pulse audience engagement and market research service to make it clear that it reaches farther than the search&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611561,"featured_media":920422,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359234193,359234192,359234194],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920917"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611561"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920917"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920917\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920422"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920917"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920917"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920917"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920913,"date":"2015-12-15T05:00:20","date_gmt":"2015-12-15T13:00:20","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920913"},"modified":"2015-12-14T16:32:36","modified_gmt":"2015-12-15T00:32:36","slug":"exploring-the-worlds-first-3d-printed-cars","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/12\/15\/exploring-the-worlds-first-3d-printed-cars\/","title":{"rendered":"Exploring the world&#8217;s first 3D-printed cars"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>3D printing technology has made a lot of advancements lately, prompting people to create more useful objects.

Before the LM3D Swim, Local Motors built the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.popularmechanics.com\/cars\/a16726\/local-motors-strati-roadster-test-drive\/\" target=\"_blank\">world\u2019s first ever 3D-printed car<\/a>, the Strati. Built and printed in Detroit, this electric car was the first step in mass producing printed cars.<\/p>\n<p>Strati changed the way the world thought about 3D-printed vehicles. In 2010, printed cars were created, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.com\/2013\/02\/3d-printed-car\/\" target=\"_blank\">such as the Urbee<\/a>, but they weren\u2019t as mechanically involved as the Strati. In the past, car panels and features were printed, then placed on a traditionally-built structure. This meant that important components, such as the battery or motor, were not created using the 3D-printer. The Strati used direct digital manufacturing for the majority of the components.<\/p>\n<p>Building a 3D car isn\u2019t easy. To \u201cprint\u201d a Strati, Local Motors had to first create the body using a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fool.com\/investing\/general\/2014\/04\/26\/the-next-big-thing-in-3-d-printing-big-area-addi-2.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Big Area Additive Manufacturing (BAM)<\/a> machine. After the body was printed, <a href=\"http:\/\/customizedpart.com\/settling-the-debate-cnc-machining-vs-3d-printing\/\" target=\"_blank\">subtractive manufacturing<\/a> using a computer numerical control routing machine, or CNC, was used. That still didn\u2019t include all of the features. Additional components were added over the course of several days. Manufacturing took a total of five\u00a0days, with 44 hours of printing.<\/p>\n<p>Local Motors plans on using this innovative process to further explore car customization and, eventually cut manufacturing costs. While the Strati was a small electric car, the company hopes to appeal to a wider audience by offering several different 3D-printed vehicles. Sport versions of the <a href=\"https:\/\/localmotors.com\/3d-printed-car\/\" target=\"_blank\">LM3D Swim<\/a>, for example, are expected to be produced in the future.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_920916\" style=\"width: 814px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/LM3D-Swim.png\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-920916\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/LM3D-Swim-804x438.png\" alt=\"Local Motor's new LM3D Swim.\" width=\"804\" height=\"438\" data-attribution=\"Local Motors\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/LM3D-Swim-804x438.png 804w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/LM3D-Swim-300x164.png 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/LM3D-Swim-968x528.png 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/LM3D-Swim-210x114.png 210w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/LM3D-Swim-320x174.png 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/LM3D-Swim-640x349.png 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/LM3D-Swim.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 804px) 100vw, 804px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Local Motor&#8217;s new LM3D Swim.<\/p><\/div>\n<h4 id=\"the-lm3d-swim\">The LM3D Swim<\/h4>\n<p>Expected to be released in 2017, the Local Motors LM3D Swim uses a <a href=\"http:\/\/ceramics.org\/ceramic-tech-today\/local-motors-debuts-new-lm3d-swim-to-drive-mass-production-of-3d-printed-cars\" target=\"_blank\">unique manufacturing technique<\/a>. While the Arizona-based company isn\u2019t a household name yet, it\u00a0does have a history of working quickly to create innovative designs. The LM3D prototype has already been produced, but future models will have a slew of customizable features.<\/p>\n<p>Because each vehicle is being 3D printed, buyers will be able to select from several <a href=\"http:\/\/www.proctorcars.com\/the-most-unusual-concept-cars\/\" target=\"_blank\">different aesthetic<\/a> features. Removable panels are a possibility, which would allow buyers to have much <a href=\"https:\/\/localmotors.com\/explore\/concept\/category\/design\/#%2F\" target=\"_blank\">more control over the design<\/a> they choose. Despite the advanced 3D capabilities, all vehicles would have the same powertrain and electronic engine.<\/p>\n<p>Not all of the components will be 3D printed in the comfort of your own home. Body panels and the chassis would likely need to be traditionally manufactured. Local Motors has been working on a way to have as many parts printed as possible. As much as 90 percent of the car will be printable using a composite ABS plastic and carbon fiber material.<\/p>\n<p>Even upgrades wouldn\u2019t likely be performed at home. Local Motors claims it\u00a0plans on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.autoblog.com\/2015\/11\/18\/local-motors-melt-3d-printed-car-recycle-la-2015\/\" target=\"_blank\">melting each car<\/a> from time to time in order to provide key upgrades. By melting unwanted components, the company can easily recycle them, cutting down on costs and waste.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"can-you%c2%a0print-a%c2%a0car-\">Can you\u00a0print a\u00a0car at home?<\/h3>\n<p>While 3D printing technology does make it possible for buyers to print a car at home, it is impractical for them to do so. Local Motors is currently constructing a new <a href=\"http:\/\/gizmodo.com\/a-visit-to-local-motors-badass-innovators-of-future-ve-1495859889\" target=\"_blank\">microfactory<\/a> to print and assemble the vehicles in. Construction in Knoxville, Tennessee is expected to be complete early next year, allowing the company to continue to focus on car designs and capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>Local Motors is striving to get the LM3D series on the market. While each car has a <a href=\"http:\/\/mashable.com\/2015\/11\/06\/local-motors-pre-sale\/#Snh0HbLFjaqD\" target=\"_blank\">hefty price tag of $53,000<\/a>, the company is expecting several pre-sales. Preorders for the vehicles will start in 2016, but it will still be at least a year before anyone gets their 3D printed vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>Because the manufacturing process and car style is still untested, federal regulations will require several tests to be performed before sales can begin. Standard crash testing is expected to start in 2016, with highway certifications quickly following.<\/p>\n<p>3D printing technology has a lot to offer the automotive industry. The innovative technology that Local Motors is using will pave the way for more designs and advancements in the future. With successful pre-sales and testing, Local Motors can become a household name.<\/p>\n<p><em>Matthew Young is an automotive reporter from Boston.

Even after it <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/facebook-quietly-shuts-down-creative-labs-and-apps\/\">shut down its Creative Labs division<\/a> and the experimental apps that emerged from it &#8212; including Riff, Slingshot, and Rooms &#8212; the company is doing its best to convince its users download the standalone photo-sharing application.<\/p>\n<p>To do that, the company\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/12\/14\/facebook-is-killing-photo-syncing-asks-users-to-download-its-moments-app-instead\/?ncid=rss\">will remove the ability<\/a> to synchronize photos across multiple devices from the\u00a0main Facebook app. (You know, the one that has steadily become less important as many of its functions are split\u00a0into standalone applications like Messenger.) Now the feature will be exclusive to Moments.<\/p>\n<p>A Facebook spokesperson provided Gigaom\u00a0the following statement via email:<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-starting-this-week-w\"><p>Starting this week, we are beginning to phase out Facebook&#8217;s photo syncing feature. This is an opt-in experience that syncs photos taken on your mobile phone to a private section on Facebook, viewable only to you, where you can view or post the photos if you choose. The feature was launched in 2012 when people took photos on their phones, but still posted primarily from computers. People that use the photo syncing feature will have the option to move the photos they&#8217;ve previously synced to our new app Moments, where they will be able to view, download, or delete them. If they don&#8217;t want to download Moments, you will also be able to download a zip file of your synced photos or delete them from your Facebook profile on your computer.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Some users could welcome this change. Moments is much better at syncing photos than the main Facebook app, and it <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.com\/2015\/06\/facebook-moments\/\">comes equipped with features<\/a> like facial recognition and tools that make it easier to get a friends&#8217; photos from an event, so it&#8217;s not like Facebook is forcing an incompetent service\u00a0on its users.<\/p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s hard not to view this as yet another of Facebook&#8217;s attempts to become the primary interface people use to interact with their digital lives. No longer can someone download the Facebook app and do anything they want with the service &#8212; now they must install a bunch of standalone apps to achieve the same result.<\/p>\n<p>The main Facebook app offers access to the news feed; Messenger lets people stay in touch with friends and family; Moments helps people manage photos; Instagram allows them to share photos with the outside world; WhatsApp makes it easy to stay in touch with people who don&#8217;t use Facebook; the list goes on.<\/p>\n<p>And we&#8217;ve reached the point where even those apps have standalone utilities. Instagram has <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.instagram.com\/post\/114416360957\/layout-from-instagram\">Layout<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.instagram.com\/post\/131684343987\/boomerang-from-instagram\">Boomerang<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/hyperlapse.instagram.com\/\">Hyperlapse<\/a>. Messenger has Selfied, Strobe, and Stickered. It&#8217;s surprising that WhatsApp hasn&#8217;t been broken into multiple pieces, or spawned a bunch of little\u00a0apps that augment its service.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Moments-Photographic.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-920908\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Moments-Photographic-804x539.png\" alt=\"Moments-Photographic\" width=\"804\" height=\"539\" data-attribution=\"Facebook\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Moments-Photographic-804x539.png 804w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Moments-Photographic-210x140.png 210w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Moments-Photographic-300x201.png 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Moments-Photographic-968x649.png 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Moments-Photographic-205x137.png 205w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Moments-Photographic-175x117.png 175w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Moments-Photographic-320x214.png 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Moments-Photographic-640x429.png 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Moments-Photographic.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 804px) 100vw, 804px\" \/><\/a>\n<p>Releasing all these standalone apps does make things easier for Facebook users. People don&#8217;t have to download Messenger, Instagram, or their add-ons if they don&#8217;t want to. Sure, they&#8217;ll be limited by what the main Facebook app can do, but they won&#8217;t have to jump between multiple apps to accomplish simple tasks.<\/p>\n<p>The gambit\u00a0also gives Facebook more and more reach on people&#8217;s home screens, though, and that could mean more time spent with its products. Instead of being confined to a single app icon, the company could now fill most of a home screen with just its applications. Facebook, in other words, is breaking out of its box.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easier to do that with Moments than with the apps Creative Labs introduced. So even as it cleans house, Facebook appears to be doing its damnedest to make sure people who might benefit at all from Moments&#8217; photo-syncing are going to download it, use it, and devote even more of their home screens to its services.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook won&#8217;t let the\u00a0Moments app join its growing pile of abandoned projects.

The company is one of Silicon Valley\u2019s oft-fabled \u201cunicorns\u201d \u2014 that is, a company for which the valuation has surpassed\u00a0the $1 billion dollar mark \u2014 and last week the company\u00a0saw its shares jumping over the initial price of $21 to just over $27, where it has held for the most part.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Atlassian was founded in 2002 and specializes in workplace software. Most of their products are aimed at streamlining workplace communication and simplifying collaboration in teams.\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">HipChat, one of its most popular products, is an email-buster comparable to Slack that brings ongoing correspondence out of lengthy email threads and into a simple chat interface shared by teams and departments within a company. JIRA Software is a project-tracking software development tool. JIRA Service Desk is a task management platform that allows teams to coordinate the living, breathing, changing tasks that often become the foibles of service teams everywhere. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">From BBC to Adobe and NVIDIA to Land Rover, Atlassian products are used by over fifty thousand teams worldwide. Which is great, but ultimately just the tip of the iceberg where the company\u2019s concerned. With the successful IPO under their belts, Atlassian\u2019s chasing down some seriously lofty goals. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cOur mission, ultimately, is to have every employee inside of every company using Atlassian products every day,\u201d says Atlassian President Jay Simons. &#8220;And when you consider that there\u2019s more than 800 million knowledge workers around the world, that\u2019s a pretty big ambition and it\u2019ll take a while to get there. The IPO doesn\u2019t really change that. That\u2019s basically been a goal of the company since inception.\u201d\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A pretty big ambition, indeed. But it\u2019s a pretty big market, too, and it\u2019s no secret that email\u2019s not particularly well-suited to the way that we work today. Inboxes that tend to get cluttered paired with our own abysmal skills when it comes to staying on top of the constant digital deluge, email\u2019s become something of a dirty word in some circles.\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Though email\u2019s something of a necessary evil that likely won\u2019t be going anywhere (no matter how much I wish the opposite were true), Atlassian products exist largely to bring conversations and collaborative efforts that don\u2019t belong in our inboxes into more appropriate arenas. Even with fifty thousand companies already onboard, there are still thousands of teams stuck in the cluttered trenches of email-only communication. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI think there\u2019s a tremendous amount of white space across teams with a lot of inefficient use of email,\u201d says Simons. &#8220;I don\u2019t think email\u2019s going away anytime soon because it is an effective way to direct certain kinds of communication to people, but I do think that when you use our products, your inbox becomes a lot smarter, more directed and more appropriate for what email\u2019s good at.\u201d\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In Simons\u2019 eyes, the successful IPO signals a recognition that what Atlassian\u2019s doing is not only working, but that there\u2019s room to grow\u2014more tasks to manage, more email chains to prevent, more projects completed on-time with fewer hiccups and dropped balls. The way we work is changing, and the response yesterday would seem to suggest that Atlasssian\u2019s going to be around to usher in some of these changes in the way we get things done. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cI think that the market and the investor enthusiasm recognizes that we\u2019ve built a pretty special company,\u201d says Simons, \u201cand also recognizes that there\u2019s a big opportunity in front of 800 million knowledge workers worldwide and teams all over the place that are trying to figure out how to work better together.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of Silicon Valley\u2019s \u201cunicorns\u201d (that is, a tech company valued at over $1 billion), Atlassian is the company behind JIRA, HipChat,&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611562,"featured_media":920901,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359220610,15716024,359216947,163,40632612,359217030,250223,359234190,34423],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920900"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611562"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920900"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920900\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920901"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920900"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920900"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920900"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920905,"date":"2015-12-14T10:17:49","date_gmt":"2015-12-14T18:17:49","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920905"},"modified":"2015-12-14T10:17:49","modified_gmt":"2015-12-14T18:17:49","slug":"uber-bucks-holiday-trend-of-killing-products-by-testing-new-services","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/12\/14\/uber-bucks-holiday-trend-of-killing-products-by-testing-new-services\/","title":{"rendered":"Uber bucks holiday trend of killing products by testing new services"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick must feel like Santa Claus. While other tech companies <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/12\/08\/for-tech-companies-tis-the-season-for-cleaning-house-killing-apps\/\">have killed off various products<\/a> during this holiday season, Uber has introduced\u00a0new experiments\u00a0in Toronto, Seattle, and Chicago. Merry Christmas! But I doubt the company is handing out these gifts because of its holiday cheer.<\/p>\n<p>It started with <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/12\/09\/uber-teases-foodies-with-standalone-ubereats-app\/\">an expanded UberEats service<\/a> in Toronto. The test will allow people who live in the city to download a standalone app &#8212; the first Uber has released &#8212; to order food off the full menus of some\u00a0one hundred restaurants. (A limited version of the service\u00a0with a restricted menu is available in other cities.)<\/p>\n<p>Then the company decided to test\u00a0a service called UberHop in Seattle. It&#8217;s a glorified bus route: People\u00a0will pay $5 to be picked up at select locations and dropped off at pre-determined destinations at particular times. Uber is, <a href=\"http:\/\/nymag.com\/daily\/intelligencer\/2015\/12\/uber-inspired-by-public-transport-everyone-hates.html\">as New York magazine put it<\/a>, emulating the most hated form of public transportation.<\/p>\n<p>It <a href=\"http:\/\/newsroom.uber.com\/seattle\/2015\/12\/more-people-in-fewer-cars\/\">also announced UberCommute<\/a>, a service that will allow Chicago residents to carpool\u00a0to reduce the cost of the\u00a0trip\u00a0for the driver and the passenger. Drivers will be partially compensated for gasoline used on the trip, and passengers will pay less than they would if they summoned a ride through\u00a0Uber&#8217;s other services.<\/p>\n<p>Of these services, the one that makes the most sense is UberEats. There isn&#8217;t much point in using UberHop instead of an existing bus system, and something like UberCommute seems likely to exacerbate Uber&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marieclaire.com\/culture\/news\/a14480\/uber-rides-dangerous-for-women\/\">violence and harassment problem<\/a>, given that it&#8217;s not running background checks on the service&#8217;s drivers.<\/p>\n<p>But the services themselves aren&#8217;t important. The key thing here is that Uber is teasing potential investors with all the possible expansions its company might make &#8212; and it&#8217;s doing so <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-03\/uber-raises-funding-at-62-5-valuation\">while trying to raise<\/a> as much as $2.1 billion in funding with a valuation of $62.5 billion, according to a report from Bloomberg Business.<\/p>\n<p>This could be part of the standard fundraising tactic: Strut your stuff, promise to innovate, and watch as the billions start to roll in. It might also, <a href=\"https:\/\/pando.com\/2015\/12\/10\/big-reason-ubereats-has-launched-right-now\/\">as Pando&#8217;s Sarah Lacy argued last week<\/a>, be a result of Uber&#8217;s inability to tout the potential of the Chinese market to investors. These pilot programs help Uber&#8217;s cause either way.<\/p>\n<p>Uber&#8217;s heart hasn&#8217;t grown three sizes this month. It&#8217;s just finally decided to use its potential to branch into areas other than rides between points &#8220;A&#8221; and &#8220;B&#8221; to woo potential investors. Considering that the company has already raised more than $8 billion in funding, there&#8217;s a good chance this strategy will work for it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick must feel like Santa Claus.

Mr. Creery and hundreds of fellow drivers in Seattle helped push for the legislation. The hope, he said, is to give drivers more say on how much they should be paid.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>If the drivers prevail in the City Council, their organization &#8212; the\u00a0<a title=\"The group\u2019s website.\" href=\"http:\/\/www.teamstertnc.org\/\">App-Based Drivers Association<\/a>\u00a0(ABDA) &#8212; will gain an explicit right to unionize on-demand workers, a first \u00a0in the US. This does not mean that the federal government has agreed, and it would be reasonable to expect that ultimately the National Labor Relations Board or the federal courts might get involved.<\/p>\n<p>Uber, its competitors like Lyft, and a wide variety of other on-demand work companies have their economics squarely based on the premise that on-demand workers are not employees, and as a result, the companies paying them for their labor can sidestep the expenses and liabilities that come with full-time employment, such as insurance, worker compensation, social security contributions, vacation, sick leave, and the like. The on-demand companies clearly benefit from this arrangement, while &#8212; at least in some cases &#8212; the on-demand workers would rather gain the protections and benefits that labor laws in the US provide.

In labor law, there are certain litmus tests to determine whether a supposed contractor is actually a misclassified\u00a0employee. The employer has a strong incentive to claim that the worker is a contractor, because that allows the firm to sidestep taxes, legal liability, and the purchase and upkeep of equipment (like cars, insurance, and gas, in the case of Uber). If the worker is controlled directly by the company \u2014 is told how and when to provide services (like Homejoy\u2019s scheduling appointments instead of its \u2018contractors\u2019 making those arrangements, what tools or equipment to use, and specific procedures to follow (like the Lyft fistbump) \u2014 then misclassification becomes more likely.<\/p>\n<p>Consider the level of control that Handy \u2014 a Homejoy competitor \u2014 applies to \u2018contractors\u2019:<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-ellen-huet%c2%a0cont5\" ><p>Ellen Huet,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/ellenhuet\/2014\/11\/18\/contractor-or-employee-silicon-valleys-branding-dilemma\/\">Contractor or Employee?

However, the company doesn\u2019t offer the alternative of full-time employment for drivers, so the experiment to prove their claim hasn\u2019t been run.\u00a0Whether drivers believe they are employees or contractors \u2014 many hold other jobs, and some preclude other \u2019employment\u2019 \u2014 is a factor in the analysis, but may be moot in the final analysis, since so much of the control of the work\u00a0is in the hands of Uber.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The reality is that we may need to develop a third category of worker to better match the times we are living in. Again, from\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/report\/handicapping-the-on-demand-market-sectors\/on-demand-on-the-stand\/\">Handicapping On-Demand Market Sectors<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-on-demand-work-has-r7\" ><p>On-demand work has risen in the national conscience to the point that presidential candidates are senators are asking difficult questions. Hillary Clinton recently <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/hillary-clinton-takes-aim-at-uber-during-speech-gig-economy\/\">said<\/a> that she plans to \u2018crack down on bosses who exploit employees by misclassifying them as contractors or even steal their wages.\u2019 Senator Mark Warner gave a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/hamzashaban\/on-demand-economy-collides-with-presidential-politics-in-war#.qr0XwzNKk4\">talk<\/a> at a DC-based think tank, New America, in which he supported the idea of a third\u00a0category of worker, saying,<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-for-many-of-these-on2\"><p>For many of these online and contingent workers, they\u2019re operating without any safety net below them. They may be doing extraordinarily well \u2014 until they\u2019re not, and then there is nothing to catch them until they end up, candidly, back on the taxpayer\u2019s dime.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The third worker class\u00a0has many possible facets, like a way to have a freelancer\u2019s clients contribute on a pro rata basis toward the sorts of benefits that full-timers receive. For example, the half of social security that employers pay for their employees is paid for freelancers, along with the employees half. In a \u2018hours bank\u2019 model, clients would pay a share. So if a freelancer worked 10 hours for company X, they would contribute one quarter of that week\u2019s employer-side social security contributions, and other clients would two.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So, we&#8217;ll have to see where this newest detour leads for Uber and the on-demand economy. It seems unlikely that the genie will be chased back into the bottle and that on-demand work will fade away.<\/p>\n<p>However, new protections for the precarious nature of on-demand work obviously need to be put in place, so that the downsides of being an independent worker do not fall solely on the shoulders of the workers, and neither\u00a0should they be socialized by state and federal governments, so that taxpayers wind up subsidizing the on-demand employers. Uber and the other companies that tout their exponential economics will have to return\u00a0some of the 20%-30% they slice out of every transaction, and reinvest that in higher salaries, pensions, and insurance for those making the on-demand economy go, ultimately. It&#8217;s just a matter of\u00a0time.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Update Tuesday 15 December 2016:<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-seattles-city-counci8\" class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Seattle&#8217;s City Council unanimously approved a bill allowing on-demand drivers (Uber, Lyft, etc.) to form unions <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/5WstApke78\">https:\/\/t.co\/5WstApke78<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Stowe Boyd (@stoweboyd) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/stoweboyd\/status\/676765683900895232\">December 15, 2015<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Uber has hit another speed bump on its way to disrupting the transportation establishment worldwide.

Cookies served as a tagging device to identify your computer among the millions of other users browsing the Internet, tracking your activity as you visited pages online. This meant marketers could use this \u201ccookie profiling\u201d to reach you via an ad exchange, or an automated pool of ad impressions. Marketers targeted potential customers based on their browsing patterns, displaying ads tailored to age, marital status, or political affiliations. When one person equaled one browser, this targeted ad model worked.<\/p>\n<p>Fast-forward to now, with consumers spreading their digital time among various devices and apps.\u00a0Today\u2019s consumer is a multi-tasking, multi-talented research expert who communicates, researches and shops on multiple devices.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, industry reports estimate that consumers spend an average of three hours each day on their mobile devices.\u00a0For marketers, following a consumer\u2019s journey across digital destinations and touch points is difficult. And for those marketers who rely on cookies to track your digital trail, their task is a difficult one. They must connect all the cookies across all of the devices and apps that you use. How can\u00a0companies\u00a0track consumer demand as well as anticipate and meet consumer needs? How can marketers best listen to customers?<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"mobile-ate-the-cookie\">Mobile ate the cookie<\/h4>\n<p>Traditionally, marketers relied on\u00a0pixel\u00a0tracking, a cookie-based technology that uses code to anonymously follow\u00a0people\u00a0around the Web as they visited webpages.\u00a0When a potential customer visits a page, the code drops a browser cookie. The cookie then determines when to serve ads, ensuring ads are sent only to those who have previously visited a particular site.\u00a0Pixel\u00a0tracking provides information on who is clicking through on ads and ending up on a sales page.<\/p>\n<p>However, five years from now, we\u2019ll look at\u00a0companies\u00a0that use\u00a0pixel-based marketing in the same way we view someone who still has a GeoCities email address &#8212; another addition to the Wayback Machine.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.emarketer.com\/Article\/Total-US-Ad-Spending-See-Largest-Increase-Since-2004\/1010982\">eMarketer<\/a>\u00a0estimates that by 2018, mobile will account for 70 percent of digital marketing spend. Mobile is complicated, as mobile browsers don\u2019t support cookies. Given consumer mobility,\u00a0pixels\u00a0and cookies fail to connect users as they shift between their various devices.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"people-and-why-they%c2%a0matte\">People, and why they\u00a0matter more than ever<\/h4>\n<p>We are moving from\u00a0pixels\u00a0to\u00a0people &#8212; more specifically\u00a0people-based marketing.<\/p>\n<p>People-based marketing allows the marketer to learn \u2013 from actual humans &#8212; about an audience\u2019s sentiments and reactions to a\u00a0company\u2019s products, performance and prices.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Facebook Atlas demonstrates that there is a simpler way to enable marketers to reach\u00a0people\u00a0that does not involve using\u00a0pixels. Atlas represents the two foundations of\u00a0people-based marketing: allowing consumers to establish their identity through opt-in\/log-in and accounting for consumer cross-device and cross-channel activity. Brands and agencies, with Atlas, can measure ad campaigns across screens\u00a0and\u00a0solve the cookie issue, targeting real\u00a0people\u00a0across mobile and the Web. Atlas uses Facebook\u2019s ID (rather than a cookie) to follow a user\u2019s journey from mobile to desktop and back.<\/p>\n<p>Humans are at the core of\u00a0people-based marketing, of course, and mining human data intelligence is integral to marketers understanding their audience.\u00a0Human data, which includes real-time feedback from real humans, is quite valuable. Brands can analyze this information to track customer responses, patterns and trends to refine their competitive edge.<\/p>\n<p>The ubiquitous nature of social media has prompted businesses to adjust their marketing strategies accordingly.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketingtechblog.com\/2014-statistics-trends-businesses-social-media\/\">Recent research<\/a>\u00a0indicates the average American spends 37 minutes per day on social media. Also, 46 percent of web users look towards social media when making a purchase. Meanwhile, 65 percent of B2B marketers invest in social media to gain market insights.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"human-marketing-requires-human\">Human marketing requires human input<\/h4>\n<p>The marketer\u2019s goal has moved beyond serving ads to the same\u00a0people\u00a0on the same device toward gaining a greater understanding \u2013 and even anticipating \u2013 consumer buying patterns. When you consider that more than half of all site visits are not even made by\u00a0people, but by bots, it\u2019s clear active human participation is vital to successful marketing.<\/p>\n<p>For example, to properly engage with potential customers regardless of device, ask their permission by requesting their email address. Urge customers to opt-in and provide product preferences so that you, the marketer, can personalize and improve the customer experience.<\/p>\n<p>Brands and agencies must first understand their audience before they can build and nurture customer relationships. This \u201cunderstanding\u201d involves going where customers are (social media on mobile devices), listening, communicating the value they offer to the consumer, and enabling user control. Modern marketing is really\u00a0people-based marketing and should involve choice and convenience across multiple devices. Only then will today\u2019s marketers gain an accurate understating of their market, customer, and future customers.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u00a0Tim is CEO at DataSift.\u00a0 Cookies were once the kings of the advertising industry, but times are changing.

While executives are tucking into their dinners, hackers will be trying to tuck into their businesses\u2019 data. High profile breaches <a href=\"http:\/\/www.heritage.org\/research\/reports\/2015\/11\/cyber-attacks-on-us-companies-since-november-2014\">this year<\/a> at organizations ranging from Anthem Healthcare to Ashley Madison and the US government\u2019s Office of Personnel Management are a reminder of the threats that lurk online. And they raise the question of whether the cyber security industry can come up with a powerful new tool to frustrate the bad guys.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s been plenty of discussion at security conferences about the impact that machine learning will have on the cyber landscape. A subset of artificial intelligence, it involves the use of powerful algorithms that spot patterns and relationships from historical data, and get better over time at making predictions about brand new data sets based on this experience. Companies such as Amazon and Netflix use machine learning to help drive their recommendation engines, and banks and other financial institutions have long used it to tackle credit card fraud.<\/p>\n<p>Now, we are starting to see some cyber security firms offering solutions that involve a machine-learning component. Huntsman Security, which counts intelligence agencies amongst its clients, recently <a href=\"http:\/\/www.heritage.org\/research\/reports\/2015\/11\/cyber-attacks-on-us-companies-since-november-2014\">announced<\/a> what it claims is the security industry\u2019s \u201cfirst machine-based threat verification technology\u201d that uses machine-learning algorithms to help analysts spot serious threats swiftly and take corrective action. Startups such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cylance.com\/\">Cylance<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/palerra.com\/\">Palerra<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.darktrace.com\/\">Darktrace<\/a> are also employing machine-learning techniques in their services. <em>[<strong>Disclosure<\/strong>: Wing Venture Capital is an investor in Palerra.]<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s tempting to portray machine learning as a silver bullet that can be used not just to wipe out hackers, but also to wipe out jobs, too, by automating tasks performed by expensive personnel. This has provoked a backlash from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.darkreading.com\/vulnerabilities---threats\/machine-learning-is-cybersecuritys-latest-pipe-dream\/a\/d-id\/1322878\">some commentators<\/a>, who have warned companies not to waste money on an unproven technology, and encouraged them to invest more in security teams and other tools instead.<\/p>\n<p>However, that critique is based on a false claim about the technology\u2019s potential \u2014 and a false dichotomy between human and machine.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take the issue of efficacy first. Machine-learning models work best when they can \u201ctrain\u201d on large volumes of data. Thanks to the rise of big data and extremely cheap storage, it\u2019s now possible to feed vast amounts of information into models, which greatly improves their ability to detect suspicious activity. The goal is to distinguish anomalous behavior in things such as network traffic that might indicate a breach while minimizing false alerts (or \u201cfalse positives\u201d to use the industry\u2019s terminology).<\/p>\n<p>There are certainly challenges to be overcome. Algorithms are only as good as the quality and quantity of the data they are trained on, and data sets on the most sophisticated kinds of attacks mounted by nation-state actors (or their proxies) are still relatively thin. Sophisticated hackers can also try to fool models by employing tactics that seek to convince them that malicious activity is in fact legitimate.<\/p>\n<p>In spite of such caveats, the machine-learning approach is still a great asset in a defensive arsenal. Given the volumes of data that security teams now have to deal with, adopting a more automated approach to querying network traffic and looking for anomalies that are not detected by traditional, signature-based systems makes sense. For instance, an analyst who has threat intelligence which suggests a network may be subject to a particular kind of data exfiltration attack could task a machine-learning model to look for telltale signs of this. Models can also provide analysts with other valuable insights, such as correlations between suspicious events.<\/p>\n<p>To minimize false positives, many models rely not just on \u201cunsupervised learning\u201d, which involves crunching data to spot patterns themselves, but also on customer-driven, \u201csupervised\u201d learning. This can take the form of specific security policies, such as one that requires an alert to be issued if a bunch of sensitive files are suddenly sent to a new location. It can also involve analysts giving\u00a0a digital thumbs-up or thumbs-down to alerts issued. Over time, this training can help a model to identify what really matters to an organization and reduce the risk of false alerts.<\/p>\n<p>Will human trainers ultimately be displaced by the \u201cmachines\u201d they teach? Some companies may use machine-learning as an excuse to downsize, but I think they\u2019ll be the exception rather than the rule. When I speak to chief information security officers, I often hear that they are concerned about a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.csoonline.com\/article\/2953258\/it-careers\/cybersecurity-job-market-figures-2015-to-2019-indicate-severe-workforce-shortage.html\">worrying shortage<\/a> of skilled cyber personnel. By putting machine-learning models to work in support of existing staff, security leaders can boost productivity and free up their teams to work on the most pressing and strategic issues.<\/p>\n<p>There is another consideration that might resonate at this time of year. Algorithms don\u2019t need to take a holiday, so they can keep on working while some of their human masters are taking a well-deserved break!<\/p>\n<p><em><del><\/del>Martin Giles is a partner at <a href=\"http:\/\/wing.vc\/\" target=\"_blank\">Wing Venture Capital<\/a> (@Wing_VC).

It\u2019s as unglamorous as it is necessary, but Trim makes at least one aspect of personal finance management a little less painful in less time than it takes to floss (probably \u2014 I don\u2019t really know your life or how long it takes you to floss, but it took me all of one minute to get underway). <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Once you connect your credit card, Trim\u2019s algorithm sifts through your transaction data to find subscriptions \u2014 things you\u2019d expect, like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime and maybe a few that you\u2019ve forgotten you\u2019re paying for or haven\u2019t gotten around to cancelling.\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I know what you\u2019re thinking: is this safe?\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Petkevich breaks it down for me and the short answer is: totally, with the help of Plaid, an API designed to securely handle bank data. Plaid\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre is to allow developers to access financial data securely, without risk to banks and customers. To connect your credit card to Trim, you simply login to your bank through Plaid and an encrypted read-only token is sent back to Trim.\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While Trim can help you cancel subscriptions you don\u2019t want, it can\u2019t access your accounts directly. No need to worry about attacks on Trim\u2019s servers, either. They\u2019re protected with Amazon Web Services (also used by NASA and the DoD) and 256-bit SSL encryption. Oh, and even if someone was feeling extra motivated and <i>did <\/i>manage to find a way into the servers, there wouldn\u2019t be anything to steal \u2014 Trim doesn\u2019t store your username or password or any other sensitive data.\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThrough these integrations with the banks, they only give read-only access tokens,\u201d says Smyth, &#8220;so there\u2019s literally no way for anything to go wrong or weirdly with your account.&#8221;\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After Trim\u2019s algorithm has had a chance to parse your transaction data, you\u2019ll get a text detailing your subscriptions, from Spotify to the Wall Street Journal.\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For those diligent folks who keep careful track of monthly statements and expenses, these probably won\u2019t come as a surprise, but it\u2019s certainly helpful to have a monthly breakdown of just how much you\u2019re dropping in subscriptions every month. Those who tend to be a little less detail-oriented with monthly transactions, however, may find something rotten in the state of Denmark. \u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Whether it\u2019s LinkedIn Premium charges, a\u00a0Wall Street Journal subscription, or the notoriously difficult to cancel gym memberships, Trim is good at weeding out the invisible financial skeletons in one\u2019s closet. And while the average person saves about $15 per month ($180 per year) with the service, the current all-time high for unearthed monthly subscriptions is a baffling 95 for a single customer. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Trim is totally free, and Smyth says that they want to keep it that way. Right now, Trim is backed by private venture capitalists and while they may one day consider adding a premium tier that includes more in-depth analysis and financial coaching, he says that because Trim\u2019s service is essentially software that doesn\u2019t cost anything to run, it doesn\u2019t seem quite right to charge people in order to help them save money. Ideally, there will always be a free version &#8212; and they mean really, truly free.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cPersonal finance is something you can always put off until another day, and we want to make it something you can today just by making it as simple as possible,\u201d says Smyth. \u201cI do think it\u2019s really, really important for us to just spend a minute doing something to get our financial lives a little more in-order, and that\u2019s where we want to help.\u201d\u00a0 <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Making sense of your personal finance is a lot like flossing \u2014 it\u2019s tedious, it\u2019s not what you might call \u201cfun\u201d, but&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611562,"featured_media":446259,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[33337,10625,314400,359234189],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920889"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611562"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920889"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920889\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/446259"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920889"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920889"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920889"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920890,"date":"2015-12-10T09:01:47","date_gmt":"2015-12-10T17:01:47","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920890"},"modified":"2015-12-10T09:01:47","modified_gmt":"2015-12-10T17:01:47","slug":"twitter-monetizes-500m-strong-audience-of-non-users","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/12\/10\/twitter-monetizes-500m-strong-audience-of-non-users\/","title":{"rendered":"Twitter monetizes 500M strong audience of non-users"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Twitter is <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/2015\/testing-promoted-tweets-on-our-logged-out-experience\">testing an expansion<\/a> of its promoted tweets advertising unit that displays the sponsored messages even if someone doesn&#8217;t sign in to its service.<\/p>\n<p>The test could help Twitter address one of its core problems: People don&#8217;t have to sign up for its service to take advantage of the public nature of its contents. Anyone capable of searching for someone on Google, or following a direct link to a public tweet, can peruse the\u00a0platform even if they\u00a0tweet something themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Many people take advantage of this fact. Re\/code <a href=\"https:\/\/recode.net\/2015\/12\/10\/its-time-to-deliver-twitter-is-finally-making-money-off-people-without-twitter-accounts\/\">reports that roughly<\/a> 500 million people who don&#8217;t have Twitter accounts visit the service each month. That&#8217;s greater than the 320 million users who log in to\u00a0the site each month, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/about.twitter.com\/company\">Twitter&#8217;s usage statistics<\/a>, and a valuable audience for advertisers.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;By letting marketers scale their campaigns and tap into the total Twitter audience, they will be able to speak to more people in new places using the same targeting, ad creative, and measurement tools,&#8221; Twitter\u00a0said. &#8220;Marketers can now maximize the opportunities they have to connect with that audience.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>According to the blog post, promoted tweets will be shown to visitors without Twitter accounts whenever they view a user profile or a tweet&#8217;s detail page. The experiment\u00a0is currently limited to the desktop Web \u00a0and being\u00a0tested\u00a0by &#8220;selected advertisers&#8221; across\u00a0the United States, Japan, United Kingdom, and Australia.<\/p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Twitter has tried to appeal to new or potential\u00a0users. Earlier this year the company <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/2015\/twittercom-gets-a-refresh\">introduced a new homepage<\/a> meant to lure people into signing up for its service. It built &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/bits.blogs.nytimes.com\/2015\/02\/02\/twitter-displays-its-value-with-instant-timeline-for-new-users\/?_r=0\">instant timelines<\/a>&#8221; for people who sign up without knowing what to do next. The service has done everything short of making it so people can post, like, or retweet something without an account.<\/p>\n<p>These promoted tweets seem like an admission that not everyone who visits Twitter will grok the value in creating an account. But someone deciding not to sign up for the service\u00a0can still be monetized as long as they&#8217;re willing to visit the site every once in a while and focus even a moment of their attention on an ad.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Twitter is testing an expansion of its promoted tweets advertising unit that displays the sponsored messages even if someone doesn&#8217;t sign in&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611561,"featured_media":834535,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920890"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611561"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920890"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920890\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/834535"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920890"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920890"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920890"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920887,"date":"2015-12-09T12:14:45","date_gmt":"2015-12-09T20:14:45","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920887"},"modified":"2015-12-09T12:14:45","modified_gmt":"2015-12-09T20:14:45","slug":"uber-teases-foodies-with-standalone-ubereats-app","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/12\/09\/uber-teases-foodies-with-standalone-ubereats-app\/","title":{"rendered":"Uber teases foodies with standalone UberEats app"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Uber is <a href=\"http:\/\/newsroom.uber.com\/toronto\/2015\/12\/ubereatsapp\/\">testing a service<\/a> that will allow Toronto residents to order food from their favorite restaurants through a standalone application called UberEats.<\/p>\n<p>That name might seem familiar.

Now, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.com\/2015\/12\/ubereats-is-ubers-first-app-thats-not-about-rides\/\">as the company told\u00a0Wired<\/a>, it wants to\u00a0give UberEats room to breathe.<\/p>\n<p>Toronto users can order food through UberEats between 10am and 10pm seven days a week. Right now the company is said to support the full menu of &#8220;over\u00a0a hundred&#8221; restaurants in the city. The service&#8217;s Instant Delivery menu, which is available in the main Uber app, offers fewer options but much\u00a0faster deliveries.<\/p>\n<p>Deliveries from UberEats will be free until 2016.

Instead, the company will now undertake a &#8216;reverse spin off&#8217;, where the company&#8217;s core Internet business &#8212; Yahoo.com, Tumblr, Yahoo Mail, Flickr, and the like &#8212; will be spun out of the company, and Yahoo will become a holding company for Alibaba and other assets. The intent of this is to avoid tax issues relating to possible divestiture of Alibaba assets, estimated at $31 billion, as those of Yahoo Japan, pegged at $8.5 billion. Yahoo&#8217;s core business is estimated to be worth only $3-$8 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Max Levchin, the co-founder of PayPal, and a major supporter of Marissa Meyer, has stepped down from the board, effective immediately, after the board&#8217;s offsite meeting. I have to read this as the blowback of a board dispute about how to direct the massive Alibaba resources. Should they be siphoned off as dividends, or separated from other assets, so investors can maximally gain from Alibaba&#8217;s rise? Or should they be invested into making Yahoo relevant again? My bet is that Meyer and Levchin lost &#8212; and lost big &#8212; at the board meeting.<\/p>\n<p>Meyer is expecting twins, and plans to take a few months off after their arrival in January. I&#8217;m betting she resigns, citing her desire to spend more time with her family.<\/p>\n<p>I admit that tracking Meyer is something of a guilty pleasure, and not for the best of reasons. When she joined Yahoo and almost immediately clamped down on remote work (see \u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/2013\/02\/yahoos-mayer-thinks-that-remote-workers-are-too-remote\/\">Yahoo\u2019s Mayer thinks that remote workers are\u2026 too remote<\/a>), I thought her priorities misaligned with the benefits of remote work for workers. And the highest hubris was when she installed a personal daycare center for her\u00a0own brood, around the corner from her office, a perq that the average worker could never get.<\/p>\n<p>But the narrative about Meyer has moved beyond her odd OCD-like fascination with details &#8212; like working personally on a new Yahoo logo, and slowing down critical hires by wanting to review them personally &#8212; and the stark questions about her inability to lead the company back into a central role in the realm of Internet Giants like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. As I said in a recent tweet, she appears more and more to be just an empty suit, incapable of turning the Yahoo\u00a0around,\u00a0despite the dozens of acquisitions she&#8217;s made.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In a major flip-flop, Yahoo has backed away from plans to spin off a holding company for the company&#8217;s stake in Alibaba&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2184122,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/940995"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2184122"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=940995"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/940995\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=940995"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=940995"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=940995"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":940996,"date":"2015-12-08T14:53:50","date_gmt":"2015-12-08T22:53:50","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/?p=248587"},"modified":"2015-12-08T14:53:50","modified_gmt":"2015-12-08T22:53:50","slug":"iot-trends-in-the-mobile-carrier-market","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/12\/08\/iot-trends-in-the-mobile-carrier-market\/","title":{"rendered":"IoT trends in the mobile carrier market"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Wireless analyst Chetan Sharma <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chetansharma.com\/usmarketupdateq32015.htm\">rolled out his numbers<\/a> on the US mobile market a couple weeks ago, with some indicators of where future growth might come for the carriers. Spoiler alert: It\u2019s not in the smart phone market.<\/p>\n<p>Sharma writes:<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-smartphone-penetrati9\" ><p>Smartphone penetration increased to 81% and roughly 97% of the devices sold now are smartphones. The smartphone penetration amongst postpaid users is now 87%&#8230;&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>\u2026.Back in 2002, very few in the industry saw what was coming in mobile data. IoT is at the same stage though mobile data was growing faster \u2013 mobile data was almost doubling in revenue every year. IoT is growing at a quarter of that rate currently. But the big two are pushing to create a larger ecosystem to accelerate the growth. AT&amp;T already had an active IoT developer program. Verizon introduced its <a href=\"https:\/\/thingspace.verizon.com\/developer\/\">ThingSpace platform<\/a>\u00a0to the developers last month. It is already selling complete IoT solutions in energy, transportation, security, and several other industry segments. The sale of IoT solutions is quite different than selling mobile data which sells itself for most part. As we mentioned before, Verizon is on track to crack the billion-dollar mark in IoT next year. For trivia buffs, Verizon passed the billion-dollar mark in mobile data revenues back in 2004 which at the time made only 5%of the overall wireless revenues for the operator.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s abundantly clear that smart phone saturation is around the corner and that everyone from the handset makers to the carriers to the chip makers are looking for the next big market. The question at this point isn\u2019t really whether IoT can be the next big thing but how big a thing will it actually be.<\/p>\n<p>Shartan points out that IoT growth measured by revenue is a quarter of the growth rate that mobile data experienced at the same stage and points out that mobile data was easier because it \u201csells itself for the most part.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The broad challenge in IoT is making products relevant to consumers, the enterprise and industry. ROI has to be proven, even at the consumer level (think energy saving thermostats), while mobile data seems to have started by addressing basic communications needs and then accelerated into today\u2019s world in which mobile data provides everything from a restaurant reservation to a ride home. This core difference is what, in my view, differentiates IoT growth from historical mobile data growth for the carriers.<\/p>\n<p>Shartan\u2019s analysis continues:<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-connected-devices-no10\" ><p>&#8230;&#8230;..Connected devices (non-phones) accounted for almost 60% of the net-adds in Q3 2015. This means that while there is a healthy smartphone sales pipeline, it is for the existing subs and as such net-adds for the phone business is tapering off and we can expect that new net-adds will continue to be dominated by the connected devices segment\u2026\u2026.For AT&amp;T, connected cars started to form a significant base of the connected devices segment with 40% of the new connections coming from cars.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>While the carriers may try to squeeze revenue out of mobile data, particularly as consumer behavior shifts toward high bandwidth activities like video streaming, the writing is on the wall that they need a strategy for IoT.<\/p>\n<p>The fact that 60 percent of net adds in Q3 came from connected devices and not phones is impressive. Yes, 28 percent of that is tablets but the rest was cars and M2M.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s unlikely that IoT will provide the kind of revenue growth that mobile data provided for the carriers, and there are challenges in selling IoT because they must deal with lots of different connected devices, often using small amounts of data.<\/p>\n<p>On the consumer product end, manufacturers often want low cost bandwidth with even lower power requirements. Given that households already spend the bulk of their connectivity charges on their smartphones and wired services, IoT products have to become valuable and relevant. Though the fact that connectivity costs are typically bundled into the product itself and not bought directly from the carrier by the consumer may help. That hasn\u2019t stopped the carriers from trying to sell their own direct to the smart home product suites.<\/p>\n<p>So\u00a0with all the caveats said, there should still be some excitement about the fact that IoT is emerging as a market for carriers. Because one things seems inevitable: growth in the smart phone market is nearing its end.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Wireless analyst Chetan Sharma rolled out his numbers on the US mobile market a couple weeks ago, with some indicators of where&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87621237,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/940996"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87621237"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=940996"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/940996\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=940996"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=940996"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=940996"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920880,"date":"2015-12-08T13:48:06","date_gmt":"2015-12-08T21:48:06","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920880"},"modified":"2015-12-08T13:54:19","modified_gmt":"2015-12-08T21:54:19","slug":"for-tech-companies-tis-the-season-for-cleaning-house-killing-apps","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/12\/08\/for-tech-companies-tis-the-season-for-cleaning-house-killing-apps\/","title":{"rendered":"For tech companies, tis the season for cleaning house &amp; killing apps"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Now is the winter of tech companies&#8217; discontent.

The company\u00a0also pulled all\u00a0the\u00a0Labs&#8217; output\u00a0from app stores.<\/p>\n<p>Mozilla joined in the action earlier this afternoon. The company plans to <a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/12\/08\/mozilla-will-stop-developing-and-selling-firefox-os-smartphones\/?ncid=rss\">stop developing and selling<\/a> devices featuring its Firefox OS, which was designed to offer a cheaper, more open mobile\u00a0platform.

Oyster&#8217;s planning to &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.oysterbooks.com\/boh7IeY7\">sunset<\/a>&#8221; its all-you-can-read book service in January 2016 after much of its team was hired to work at Google.

What should you do? Well, if you&#8217;re in danger, you should probably find safety. And if you&#8217;re safe, there&#8217;s a good chance that you <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slate.com\/articles\/technology\/technology\/2013\/04\/boston_bombing_breaking_news_don_t_watch_cable_shut_off_twitter_you_d_be.html\">should wait until the next day<\/a> to learn more about what the shooting because\u00a0of how much\u00a0misinformation is involved with a major story such as this. But, if you must follow breaking news, you might want to check Snapchat first.<\/p>\n<p>Snapchat might seem like an improbable source of breaking news\u00a0updates. The service is known primarily\u00a0for letting people superimpose goofy stickers over their selfies and taking some of the risk out of sharing nude photographs with others (because those photos\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/09\/15\/snapchat-monetizes-a-feature-that-runs-counter-to-its-reason-for-being\/\" target=\"_blank\">sort of<\/a> disappear forever). As the San Bernardino shooting that killed 14 people and injured another 21 on December 2 unfolded, though, the service <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ibtimes.com\/snapchat-san-bernardino-story-shows-networks-entry-breaking-news-2209169\">became a source<\/a> of up-to-the-minute briefings\u00a0on what was happening in neighborhoods around the targeted area.<\/p>\n<p>Offering these updates <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/snapchat-enters-breaking-news-with-the-san-bernardino-shooting-2015-12\">required Snapchat<\/a> to find publicly-posted snaps, curate them into one story, and,\u00a0in some cases, use\u00a0text to clarify what was happening. This gave Snapchat users\u00a0an idea of what people in the area were sharing &#8212; and provided much needed background information that informed users without making it seem like Snapchat knew the entire story. It was just a simple service gathering news and making it available to the people who might\u00a0benefit from seeing it.<\/p>\n<p>Combine this with the ephemeral nature of Snapchat&#8217;s content and it seems like the service might be a good source for breaking news. It can react quickly, use content from many users, and pass along brief updates on the situation as they happen. When the situation has resolved, all that content disappears, making it less likely to contribute to the flood of misinformation that can haunt the web, while law enforcement and the journalists covering it\u00a0struggle to find the truth.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy for misinformation to spread on the web. Hitting &#8220;like&#8221; or &#8220;retweet&#8221; on a false report doesn&#8217;t require much effort &#8212; certainly less than it does to spend a few seconds looking for accurate information or sharing new info as it becomes available. That misinformation often remains until someone goes through and deletes it, which is another opportunity for someone to get the wrong idea about something, share that idea, and keep the perpetual ignorance machine going.<\/p>\n<p>Snapchat&#8217;s self-deleting updates don&#8217;t afford this opportunity. There&#8217;s no perpetuity. It&#8217;s a bit like talking on the phone with someone: Unless they&#8217;ve taken extra steps to record whatever was said, the information is passed along once before it disappears into the aether. The photo-and-video-based nature of the service also lends itself to eyewitness accounts, which limits the claims people can make. (Not that video or photo evidence on social media is infallible.)<\/p>\n<p>I reached out to Snapchat to get their perspective on their news-aggregation. I was given a statement attributed to the company&#8217;s head of communications: &#8220;We published this story because we felt that the content, which comes from the LA Local Story, was newsworthy and held national significance&#8221; &#8212; and later told that my followup questions wouldn&#8217;t be answered. &#8220;We have nothing more to share at this time, sorry,&#8221; a spokesperson said in a rather short\u00a0email. &#8220;Thanks!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Still, it wouldn&#8217;t be a surprise if Snapchat did something similar in the future. \u00a0It&#8217;s in a unique position to offer people lightweight updates about a developing situation from the eyes of the people most affected by it. Combined with a little editorial judgment and some other features, like the one that allows Snapchat users to view similar content from other public stories, that seems like a nice setup for anyone who wants to know what&#8217;s happening in a breaking news story.<\/p>\n<p>Will there be downsides? Of course. Some of Snapchat&#8217;s verbiage doesn&#8217;t mesh with what it&#8217;s showing during stories like this. (&#8220;Swipe up to Explore similar Snaps!&#8221; read a line of text shown over a photo of kids lining up to leave\u00a0a locked-down school.) And there&#8217;s always the chance that the company will pass along videos or images that somehow mislead their viewers. I wouldn&#8217;t expect the company to have all the answers about important story developments, either.<\/p>\n<p>But if someone is unwilling to wait for law enforcement to investigate the situation, for journalists to get to the bottom of the story, and for the frenzied masses to stop sharing whatever information comes to them, they could do worse than to check Snapchat.

December 15 marks the deadline to sign up for health coverage in order to be covered in 2016.\u00a0And, seemingly recognizing that making sense of the complex health coverage landscape is about the least festive thing there is, the White House spoke up today with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/blog\/2015\/12\/08\/working-together-help-americans-getcovered\" target=\"_blank\">dispatch<\/a> about health care technology.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">White House digital strategy director Joshua Miller took to the blog to discuss the record low of uninsured Americans, as well as\u00a0highlighting few of the companies that are leveraging technology to help the uninsured get coverage.

In the process, it&#8217;s offering\u00a0more evidence that it wants to compete with Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>A\u00a0Twitter spokesperson\u00a0confirmed that the company is testing a new timeline. &#8220;This is an experiment. We&#8217;re continuing to explore ways to surface the best content for people using Twitter,&#8221; the spokesperson said in an email. &#8220;That&#8217;s all we have to share on the test at the moment.&#8221; Other\u00a0questions weren&#8217;t answered.<\/p>\n<p>The Facebook-ification of Twitter isn&#8217;t new. Everyone&#8217;s favorite little tweety bird has redesigned its user profiles, removed <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/08\/13\/t-should-be-for-twitter\/\">the limit on<\/a> direct messages, and even changed its iconic &#8220;favorite&#8221; to the &#8220;like&#8221; most often associated with Facebook. But the reverse-chronological timeline continues to differentiate the networks.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook doesn&#8217;t trust its users to be content\u00a0with a time-ordered News Feed. The company uses all kinds of algorithms to determine what&#8217;s most likely to make its users scroll down through the status updates, image macros, and videos shared to its service. It&#8217;s almost like the company has to spoon-feed its users.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter doesn&#8217;t bother with that. It simply regurgitates what other users have said, almost like it&#8217;s mama-birding its users with 140-character snippets of text. The stuff Twitter users put into the service is the same stuff (for the most part) that will come out when other users mindlessly check the service for updates.<\/p>\n<p>A timeline like the one with which Twitter&#8217;s experimenting changes that. Now instead of an unfiltered feed that people can trust to show them whatever they people they follow have decided to share, now they&#8217;ll be presented with whatever view of the world Twitter thinks is most likely to keep their eyes on its service.<\/p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Twitter has changed the timeline. It&#8217;s also <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2014\/oct\/17\/twitter-tweets-timeline-dont-follow\">inserted tweets from users<\/a> that a person doesn&#8217;t follow to try and get them to interact with new people, selected tweets a <a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2014\/12\/31\/while-you-were-away-we-filled-your-timeline\/\">user\u00a0might have missed<\/a> with a &#8220;While you were away&#8221; feature, and created an &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/bits.blogs.nytimes.com\/2015\/02\/02\/twitter-displays-its-value-with-instant-timeline-for-new-users\/?_r=0\">instant timeline<\/a>&#8221; to acclimate new users to its service.<\/p>\n<p>Though this experiment shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise. Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey said in a second quarter earnings call that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/3049161\/tech-forecast\/twitters-jack-dorsey-we-continue-to-question-the-reverse-chronological-timelin\">the company would <\/a>&#8220;continue to question the reverse chronological timeline&#8221; as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slate.com\/blogs\/future_tense\/2015\/07\/28\/twitter_q2_earnings_how_jack_dorsey_is_reinventing_the_company.html\">it attempts to<\/a> &#8220;balance recency with relevance.&#8221; This experiment is a step in that direction.<\/p>\n<p>Now the service will see how many of its users preferred to consume\u00a0whatever Twitter forced\u00a0back up its digital gullet or if they&#8217;ll like the more selective diet afforded by an algorithmically-determined timeline.\u00a0Perhaps the company could ask Facebook for pointers on how to make its users take whatever they can get.<\/p>\n<p><em>h\/t <a href=\"http:\/\/motherboard.vice.com\/read\/twitter-is-testing-timelines-that-arent-in-chronological-order\" target=\"_blank\">Motherboard<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Twitter has changed a lot in the last few months.

A 40-minute-long podcast episode might have plenty of quotable, sharable moments, but doing so is kind of a pain. You can transcribe the entire quote and then share to Facebook\/Twitter. Or, you could make a general comment and link to where that particular episode is hosted online, and allow those interested to figure out what you were talking about (even though they probably won&#8217;t). New startup <a href=\"http:\/\/www.clammr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Clammr<\/a> has a solution that might be a game changer for podcasts, and interesting audio of all sorts.<\/p>\n<p>The service, launching today, allows you to click a &#8220;Clammr&#8221; button whenever you come across a particularly interesting or sharable moment while listening to streaming audio. It then grabs a 24-second clip (starting a few seconds before you press the button to ensure you get the good parts) that can then be easily shared on Facebook, Twitter, etc. For Twitter, Clammr is actually only the second service to be granted access to a special embedded audio Twitter card (with SoundCloud being the other).<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We decided on 24 seconds because that&#8217;s roughly enough time to capture a good [clip] of a podcast or audio program, but not enough that it wastes your time,&#8221; Clammr cofounder\u00a0Parviz Parvizi told Gigaom, adding that the length also lends itself very well to sharing.<\/p>\n<p>With today&#8217;s launch, Clammr is also announcing partnerships with on-demand audio networks\u00a0PodcastOne and Midroll, as well as integration with a slew of podcast hosting platforms such as\u00a0Libsyn, Blubrry, Spreaker, Buzzsprout, Podbean, and others. The startup is also debuting an iOS app, which allows users to keep track of all the audio content they&#8217;ve Clammred and gain access to a playlist of all those audio clips. (I&#8217;m not entirely sure how useful that last feature might be right now.)<\/p>\n<p>Parvizi said that Clammr isn&#8217;t just intended for listeners, and envisions podcast hosts using the short 24-second format to better promote their shows throughout the week.\u00a0Beyond that, the service could also prove useful in getting more life out of video programming that typically never has the audio portion ripped. For instance, that last Superman v. Batman trailer? I&#8217;d have loved to use Clammr to rip only the <a href=\"http:\/\/io9.com\/the-major-reveals-from-the-batman-v-superman-trailer-1745886729\" target=\"_blank\">super campy lines<\/a> to share among friends.<\/p>\n<p>As for a business model,\u00a0Parvizi declined to elaborate but did say advertising and packaging Clammr into a premium product for media businesses were both possibilities.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While the medium of podcasting is currently experiencing\u00a0renewed interests &#8212; both business and from listeners, there are still some key issues that&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":402,"featured_media":920873,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359234183,359234184,359216281],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920871"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/402"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920871"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920871\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920873"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920871"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920871"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920871"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920866,"date":"2015-12-07T11:09:31","date_gmt":"2015-12-07T19:09:31","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920866"},"modified":"2015-12-07T11:09:31","modified_gmt":"2015-12-07T19:09:31","slug":"unsurprisingly-dropbox-to-shutter-mailbox-and-carousel-focus-on-businesses","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/12\/07\/unsurprisingly-dropbox-to-shutter-mailbox-and-carousel-focus-on-businesses\/","title":{"rendered":"Unsurprisingly, Dropbox to shutter Mailbox and Carousel, focus on businesses"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Dropbox <a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.dropbox.com\/dropbox\/2015\/12\/saying-goodbye-to-carousel-and-mailbox\/\">has abandoned its efforts<\/a> to take over your smartphone. The company announced today that it will shutter two applications, Mailbox and Carousel, in 2016 as a result of its new focus on helping workers collaborate with each other. But it&#8217;s hard to see how chasing business workers instead of targeting consumers will change Dropbox&#8217;s core problem: That it remains a feature convinced it was a product, then a startup, and then a company that&#8217;s raised more than $1 billion.<\/p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t a new argument. People have been saying that Dropbox is a feature instead of a product almost since the company&#8217;s file storage service first debuted. There&#8217;s no denying the convenience afforded by that service. Being able to trust that files would appear on multiple devices, or on\u00a0the Web, without having to carry around a bunch of flash drives filled with important documents was huge. But was it a strong enough lodestone for a billion-dollar company to be built on?<\/p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/victoriabarret\/2011\/10\/18\/dropbox-the-inside-story-of-techs-hottest-startup\/\">December 2009<\/a>, Steve Jobs warned Dropbox co-founders Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi that Apple would compete with their service if they declined an acquisition offer. He kept that promise. Apple released\u00a0iCloud in 2011. Google followed it with Google Drive in 2012. Microsoft introduced\u00a0several\u00a0cloud tools. And other companies like SpiderOak, Box, and Amazon introduced tools that either competed indirectly with Dropbox or operated\u00a0on a much different scale.<\/p>\n<p>Dropbox&#8217;s core feature is still as amazing as it was a few years ago. It&#8217;s just that no-one can purchase a smartphone, tablet, or laptop without being prompted to use a competitive service. Using an iPhone? Set up iCloud. Created a Google account because of that new Android tablet? Use Google Drive. Replacing that Windows ME-running hunk of plastic with a newer PC? Here, try OneDrive. People can use sync services without ever having to know that Dropbox exists.<\/p>\n<p>The same is true of the services being shuttered. Mailbox was ahead of its time: I remember downloading the app, swiping through my inbox, and wondering how I could ever live with another email app. But then it languished, seemed to be ridden with bugs that were never fixed, and I switched to Gmail&#8217;s official app. Other companies improved their email apps all the while, with\u00a0Apple updating <a href=\"http:\/\/www.macworld.com\/article\/2951491\/ios\/mail-in-ios-9-three-huge-changes-that-will-make-email-less-awful.html\">Mail<\/a>, Gmail tinkering with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/inbox\/\">Inbox<\/a>, and Microsoft debuting a brand-new <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2015\/5\/28\/8673523\/best-iphone-email-app-outlook-gmail-apple-mail-ios\">Outlook<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Carousel also worked fine. But that was exactly the problem &#8212; it was just fine. All the cloud services that Dropbox competes with for file synchronization also offer photo storage services. Products like Google&#8217;s new (<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/10\/20\/google-photos-reaches-100m-users-in-five-months\/\">and popular<\/a>) Photos service takes it a step further by automatically sorting images and\u00a0generating montages. Carousel doesn&#8217;t do anything that iCloud, Photos, and other services don&#8217;t do. So why bother setting up a service that can, and now will, disappear any moment?<\/p>\n<p>Now, Dropbox will focus on its business customers. That begins with services like <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/10\/15\/dropbox-beta-tests-paper-a-collaborative-writing-tool\/\">Paper<\/a>, a collaborative writing app, and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/10\/12\/dropbox-and-adobe-partner-to-make-pdf-editing-less-annoying\/\">new-yet-boring<\/a> features like PDF-editing. Are either of those going to be enough to convince businesses to choose Dropbox over competitive services that do the same things? (There are many, like Google Docs and the Microsoft Office suite, for\u00a0starters.) The company seems to think that focusing on these apps and shuttering its consumer products might help.<\/p>\n<p>No matter what happens, you have to give Dropbox credit. It survived after Jobs warned it about its prospects in 2009. Then, when Farhad Manjoo <a href=\"https:\/\/pando.com\/2012\/02\/26\/steve-jobs-was-right-dropbox-is-a-feature-not-a-product\/\">wrote in 2012<\/a> that Jobs was right, Dropbox kept moving\u00a0along.

Timeshifting and multitasking force work to be discontinuous, and demand loosely coordinated, short-term projects. Decentralized teams get less oversight and are relying on results-only work styles.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been talking with a lot of task management product managers recently, as I gear up for the 2016 Task Management Narrative, an in-depth look at a long list of task management tools, including\u00a0Asana, Azendoo, Basecamp, Clarizen, Flow, Producteev, Wrike, Smartsheet, Todoist, Trello, and others. And I have lit upon a problem regarding task management that none of the tools seem to address.<\/p>\n<p>My work is discontinuous. So the actual work associated with any given task is likely to be performed in a fragmented way: two hours yesterday, 45 minutes today, and 4 hours over the weekend. Task management tools are designed to allow me to deal with some aspects of my work &#8212; such as assigning a due date (quite a common feature) and perhaps a start date (a much less common feature) &#8212; but the discontinuous reality of actually getting things done is not well supported.<\/p>\n<p>In my case, I use a daily technique for planning my work &#8212; as do many others &#8212; but it is not actually supported by a computerized tool: I use an Action Notebook, designed by Behance, and each morning pick the tasks that I am going to work on, and write them on the righthand page. [Note: this is not exactly the version of notebook I use, but the differences don&#8217;t matter.]\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Screen-Shot-2015-12-06-at-11.35.34-AM.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-248583 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Screen-Shot-2015-12-06-at-11.35.34-AM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-12-06 at 11.35.34 AM\" width=\"610\" height=\"491\" \/><\/a>\n<p>You&#8217;ll see that there are only seven of the task areas (in blue) on the right hand page. Based on my immense laziness but equally great self-awareness, I know I can only accomplish a few things each day, because life and me. My technique is to plan on working on one task that will involve an hour or more of my time, which I designate as the top-most, and I write &#8216;1\/1&#8217; and then the work I plan to do, like &#8216;1\/1 write up\u00a0A gap in task management: discontinuous work&#8217;. I allot two slots for working on two activities in the 1\/2 hour to 1 hour range, such as phone calls, and I denote them as &#8216;1\/2&#8242; and 2\/2&#8217;. I am still an optimist because I believe I can accomplish three tasks taking (in principle) less than a 1\/2 hour, which I denote &#8216;1\/3&#8217;, &#8216;2\/3&#8217;, and &#8216;3\/3&#8217;. There is one additional slot available at the bottom, which is a wildcard for the unexpected.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it. 1 2 hour block of work + 2 45 minute blocks of work + 3 30 minute blocks of work = 2 +1.5 +1.5 = 5 hours. The rest of a prototypical day is consumed by lunch, emails, unexpected requests, dithering, and miscellaneous activities.<\/p>\n<p>And I seldom have a day go as planned. Circumstances intrude. A call is rescheduled. An unexpected opportunity leads to a proposal. Again, because life and me. So, very often I start out on Tuesday making a list and including things that I never could get to on Monday.<\/p>\n<p>Your mileage may vary.<\/p>\n<p>The point I am making is not the specifics of how I manage my time each day &#8212; and each week, in a less refined fashion &#8212; but that I am trying to schedule my work each day, and it is not well-integrated with my calendar or my task management solution. There are some exceptions, such as telephone calls or other meetings, which are always\u00a0scheduled on my calendar (Google Calendar), but in general my\u00a0day-to-day participation in the tasks I am working against is captured only in my work journal, and not in my task management tool of choice (Todoist, at present).<\/p>\n<p>What I envision as a solution requires a few new features, or refinements of features.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Treat tasks as discontinuous<\/strong> &#8212; Instead of modeling tasks as though they are monolithic, they would be better modeled as a discontinuous sequence of fragments. This is something like the way that time trackers work, although I am less interested in the keeping track of time aspect, and more on the planning side.<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, we have the general concept of subtask, but that is used in a different way, means to break a more abstract task into a collection of tasks that can be distributed to multiple individuals, and undertaken possibly in parallel. Subtasks also are used to capture dependencies across phases or stages in projects, which isn&#8217;t what I am getting at. Even if I were to use a solution with subtasks and task dependencies, I would still want to plan around discontinuous chunks of work making up those tasks and subtasks.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Surface\u00a0daily and weekly planning in calendars with other scheduled activities &#8212;<\/strong>\u00a0As Mike Monteiro at Mule Design\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/muledesign.com\/2010\/10\/the-chokehold-of-calendars\/\">put it<\/a>,<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-most-people-don%e2%812\" ><p>Most people don\u2019t schedule their work. They schedule the interruptions that prevent their work from happening. In the case of a business like ours, what clients pay us to make and do happens in the cracks between meetings, or worse, after business hours.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So I would like to *not* use a work journal to enter my 1\/2\/3 task plans everyday. I would rather do it within my task management tool. Imagine a daily planning regime, where I would pick today&#8217;s tasks from my task management tool&#8217;s task\u00a0list, and for each I could allocate a hypothetical time range &#8212; in my discipline , 2 hours, 45mins, and 30 mins &#8212; and have those task fragments associated with the appropriate tasks as a new sort of metadata, something like comments. At the end of each day &#8212; or the next morning &#8212; I could indicate &#8212; with check boxes, notes, etc. &#8212; whether in fact I actually did work on the task as planned, and when (if I care about the <em>when<\/em>). So at any point I could look at the history of the work done on any\u00a0task, and the days when I did that work.<\/p>\n<p>And it would be best if my task management tool had a real &#8217;round-trip&#8217; sync with my work calendar, so I could drag my work fragments around other calendar\u00a0events, and my plans regarding the fragments would show up on my calendar, allowing me to sidestep the calendar\/work paradox that Mike Monteiro wrote about. (Even better would be an AI &#8216;bot that would move fragments around on my calendar based on my preferences, like scheduling the 1\/1 task for early morning, when my concentration is best, and moving tasks involving calls and meetings to the afternoon.) Since the actual work I plan to do would actually show up on my work calendar, others wouldn&#8217;t schedule an unexpected meeting right in the middle of me writing this blog post.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Takeaway<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s possible to imagine that I could phony up a way to do\u00a0discontinuous tasks with a lot of manual work, today. I&#8217;ve tried at various times with various task management tools, but those have always been unsatisfactory and very time consuming.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The key takeaway<\/strong> is that <strong>supporting how we actually work &#8212; not a simplified and incomplete analog of it &#8212; requires complex tools that are designed for that purpose<\/strong>. The reality is that <strong>today&#8217;s task management solutions don&#8217;t reflect the 3D world of work<\/strong>, or do so only in a drastically minimized way. The <strong>vendors that push in that direction will likely be the victors in this marketplace.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;ve written a great deal on what we call the 3D workforce &#8212; decentralized, distributed, and discontinuous.

These positions are driven by the influx of data with which companies now need to contend, across even industries that were not previously data-oriented.<\/p>\n<p>The CAO\u2019s role most closely aligns with business intelligence, leveraging data analytics to create real business value and inform strategic decisions. Yet, the CAO\u2019s responsibilities also encompass discovering the various and constantly changing threats and opportunities impacting a business.<\/p>\n<p>The most dramatic shift in data-driven business intelligence that has necessitated this role is the sheer volume, variety, and velocity of data now available to the enterprise. Data is no longer just static or historical, but real-time, streaming, unstructured, and abundant from both public and proprietary sources.<\/p>\n<p>Unstructured data is the fastest growing category of data, and within it stream data \u2013 time-stamped series of records \u2013 is the fastest growing sub-category. Stream data spans messaging, social media, mobile data, CRM, sales, support, IT data, sensor and device data such as the emerging internet-of-things, and even live video and audio.<\/p>\n<p>The CAO\u2019s charge is to enable the enterprise to deal with all of this data and generate timely, actionable intelligence from it \u2013 increasingly in real-time.\u00a0I\u2019ve been <a href=\"http:\/\/www.novaspivack.com\/uncategorized\/how-bottlenose-analyzes-72-billion-messages-a-day-to-find-trends\" target=\"_blank\">calling this<\/a> process of business intelligence for streaming data \u201cstream intelligence\u201d for a while now. Among the dozens of CAOs I\u2019ve spoken with recently, moving from classical business intelligence on static data to stream intelligence is one of their biggest priorities for 2016. This emerging form of BI creates unique problems for enterprise companies, but it also creates unique opportunities for those companies to discern and discover trends early, while there is still time to act on them.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"understanding-bi-3-0\">Understanding BI 3.0<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/search?term=thomas+h.+davenport\" target=\"_blank\">Thomas Davenport<\/a> is a professor at Babson College, a research fellow at the MIT Center for Digital Business, and a senior advisor to Deloitte Analytics. He has written eloquently about these topics since 2010 and offers a framework for thinking about the past, present, and future of analytics.<\/p>\n<p>For Davenport, BI 1.0 was about traditional analytics, providing descriptive reporting from relatively small internally sourced data. It was about back-room teams and internal decision reports.<\/p>\n<p>BI 2.0 was about complex, much larger unstructured data sources. It was also about new computational capabilities that ran on top of traditional analytics. With big data, we saw data scientists first emerge, alongside several waves of new data-based products and services. This is where we are today.<\/p>\n<p>BI 3.0 is about rapid, agile insight delivery \u2013 analytical tools at the point of decision, and decision making at scale. Today, analytics are considered a key asset enabling strategic decision making, not merely a mirror reflecting an organization&#8217;s past and present.<\/p>\n<p>The \u201chow\u201d of accomplishing this vision amounts to balancing support for the \u201cthree V\u2019s\u201d of data &#8212; volume, variety, velocity &#8212; in the enterprise analytics stack. Most big data and BI technologies to-date were engineered to solve volume and variety, with very little emphasis placed on the velocity of data and analytics. This has to change.<\/p>\n<p>Analysts are already drowning in volume, variety, and velocity of data. To make matters worse, the rate at which new analysts are being trained is far less than the growth rate of demand for analysts and data scientists. In fact, the gap between the supply of analyst hours and the demand for analyst cycles is growing exponentially. This means that there will never be enough data scientists to cope with the rise of unstructured stream data in the enterprise.<\/p>\n<p>To solve the growing \u201canalyst gap\u201d we either need to figure out how to make exponentially more analysts, or we have to figure out how to make the finite supply of analysts exponentially more productive. I prefer the latter solution, but to accomplish it, analysts need automation.<\/p>\n<p>Manual analysis by humans is still possible for structured data, but not for streaming data. Streaming data is just too complex, and changes too fast for human analysts to keep up with on their own. Automation is the only practical way to keep up with changing streams of big data.<\/p>\n<p>BI 3.0 emphasizes real-time business impact and makes use of automation in the analytics process. This will increasingly be achieved with a seamless blend of traditional analytics and big data. BI 3.0 analytics are now integral to running the business day-to-day and hour-to-hour.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"following-the-flow-of-big-data\">Following the flow of big data investment<\/h4>\n<p>I\u2019ll close by talking about where big data investment dollars are starting to go. In short, real-time stream data is now a major priority, and historical data is now riding in the back seat.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2015\/02\/your-data-should-be-faster-not-just-bigger\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard Business Review<\/a>, 47 percent of expenditures are directed towards process improvement. 26 percent are directed towards accommodating a greater variety of data, and 16 percent address a greater volume of data. Velocity of data today represents a very small slice, at three percent of overall investment, but that slice will grow quickly in 2016.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, organizations that have prioritized real-time data are outpacing all others, <a href=\"https:\/\/community.datawatch.com\/servlet\/JiveServlet\/previewBody\/1022-102-1-1025\/Aberdeen%20on%20Real%20Time%20Visualization.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">according<\/a> to Aberdeen Group.

That feeling&#8217;s only exacerbated by the fact that comparing wines this way often takes much longer than it should because of the apps used to gather information.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vivino.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Vivino<\/a> is changing that with a new feature that makes it easy to compare a few bottles of wine without having to jump back and forth between various screens. The feature, which is aptly named Quick Compare, displays at the bottom of the screen community ratings for each bottle scanned. People interested in learning more can also tap a button to get more details about the fermented grape juice.<\/p>\n<p>Heini Zachariassen, the company&#8217;s chief executive, says Quick Compare came about partly because Vivino users wanted the app to be more efficient and partly because the company itself was frustrated about how it handled comparisons. The feature was a hit with focus groups, and Zachariassen said that even though it&#8217;s a small addition to the app people were very excited when they got to test\u00a0it.<\/p>\n<p>It isn&#8217;t hard to see why. Apps like Vivino are used in two ways: By people looking to catalogue and rate the wines they drink; and by people wandering around the aisles of a wine store trying to decide what bottle they should spend money on. A scanning feature that takes a lot of time to use is fine for first usage category, but it wasn&#8217;t particularly convenient for people who primarily relied on the second.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the desire to learn more about a wine before purchasing it can be handled in other ways. There <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/10\/28\/wine-ring-app-removes-some-stress-from-wine-buying\/\">are recommendation services<\/a> like Wine Ring, which claim to know what people like to drink based on their existing habits, and there&#8217;s always the knowledge held by workers in most reputable wine stores. There&#8217;s also the pull and pray method &#8212; off the shelf, weirdos &#8212; but that&#8217;s risky.<\/p>\n<p>Nothing will remove the shame of plucking bottle after bottle off a shelf and trusting the masses to choose what wine should be purchased. But at least now Vivino users will be able to conduct\u00a0their business quickly instead of repurposing a utility that was clearly developed with one particular use-case in mind. Will that help the app reach new users? Maybe. Could it make Vivino&#8217;s existing users appreciate the app a little bit more? Almost certainly. Sometimes that&#8217;s enough.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There&#8217;s nothing quite like being the asshole in the wine shop who keeps grabbing a bottle, holding it in front of his&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611561,"featured_media":555220,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359234182,814],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920857"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611561"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920857"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920857\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/555220"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920857"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920857"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920857"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920845,"date":"2015-12-04T12:10:51","date_gmt":"2015-12-04T20:10:51","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920845"},"modified":"2015-12-04T12:10:51","modified_gmt":"2015-12-04T20:10:51","slug":"why-vr-content-investment-in-a-galaxy-far-far-away-is-just-the-beginning","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/12\/04\/why-vr-content-investment-in-a-galaxy-far-far-away-is-just-the-beginning\/","title":{"rendered":"Why VR content investment in &#8216;a galaxy far, far away&#8217; is just the beginning"},"content":{"rendered":"<p class=\"p1\">Lucasfilm&#8217;s ILMxLAB studio recently released virtual reality content for the official Star Wars mobile apps, marking the first time the beloved sci-fi\u00a0property\u00a0has dabbled in VR content. It definitely won&#8217;t be the last, either.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The new experience, called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.starwars.com\/news\/experience-star-wars-like-never-before-in-jakku-spy\" target=\"_blank\">Jakku Spy<\/a>, is designed for use with Google Cardboard. Jakku Spy is an experience in installments, and today marks the first installment&#8217;s release. New pieces of the Jakku Spy puzzle will be uploaded every few days leading up to the <i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens <\/i>release on December 18.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The\u00a0first VR experience itself is short: You&#8217;re treated to the signature Star Wars crawl, which informs you that you&#8217;re a spy for the Resistance on the desert planet Jakku where you&#8217;ll be on the lookout for enemy activity. Then, you find yourself standing atop a massive sloping sand dune, surrounded by high temperatures and\u00a0hot, dry wind. There&#8217;s plenty to see, but you&#8217;ll scarcely have time to inspect before a speeder whizzes past, weapons ablaze. A moment later, a few bleeps and bloops grab your attention and you&#8217;ll turn to find a looking small, helpful, and very round BB-8 with a message for you.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That&#8217;s it, really. It&#8217;s just a taste. It&#8217;s a chance to step onto Jakku, to look around, to take ownership of your own perspective within a created world. And for now, that&#8217;s how VR exists in our world &#8212; the &#8220;real&#8221; one.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jakku Spy is made to be intentionally limited and short. It&#8217;s supplemental. It&#8217;s a bite-sized experienced, contained in something that many of us have access to: a smartphone. It requires no special equipment, no high-powered computer, no costly headset and no wires. Google Cardboard was designed around the core principle of accessibility. Headsets are often around $30 (though special edition Star Wars Google Cardboard headsets themed after BB-8, R2-D2, Kylo Ren, and a Stormtrooper will be for sale in-store at Verizon retail locations) and most Google Cardboard apps and experiences themselves are free.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In many ways, Google Cardboard is the world&#8217;s necessary first step into VR. One of virtual reality&#8217;s biggest challenges on the road to mainstream acceptance is access. You can&#8217;t know how utterly <i>different <\/i>a VR experience is until you&#8217;ve tried it for yourself, and words simply fall flat. Trying to describe what a VR experience is like to someone who has never tried it is like trying to explain the way the wind feels or what it&#8217;s like to see the ocean for the first time. And, if we&#8217;re being honest, Google Cardboard isn&#8217;t anywhere close to the best VR has to offer us. It&#8217;s light years away from Oculus Rift and HTC&#8217;s Vive and even Samsung&#8217;s Gear VR.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But this, Google Cardboard, is our necessary first step. And the involvement of what is arguably the world&#8217;s largest film franchise is nothing if not a clear indicator of the future of VR and the extent to which Disney and Lucasfilm understand that for now, it&#8217;s important that everyone be able to experience Jakku for themselves, without the aid of early adopter equipment.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There&#8217;s more coming in VR. More content. More headsets. More frames per second, more time behind the lenses, more sound. Just <i>more.\u00a0<\/i>There will, inevitably, be a time when we have long, standalone experiences in the headset. The technology is progressing, the demand is growing. But for now, VR experiences are supplemental. They&#8217;re short, they add depth and immersion to existing IP&#8217;s and experiences. There are opportunities for VR storytelling, but for now, introducing viewers to familiar characters and worlds through a new lens has proven an effective first step into VR.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In the announcement this morning, Rob Bredow, Lucasfilm&#8217;s head of New Media\/VP, Advanced Development group said,<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-ilmxlabs-whole-found\">\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;ILMxLAB&#8217;s whole foundation and mission is about creating immersive entertainment, and that includes virtual reality. We think a lot of people are going to experience virtual reality in Google Cardboard for the first time with Jakku Spy. It&#8217;s a great opportunity because there&#8217;s this familiar content &#8212; characters and vehicles that you&#8217;ve seen in trailers &#8212; but you&#8217;re seeing it in a completely new way.&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jakku Spy is meant to draw you in, to build anticipation for <i>The Force Awakens, <\/i>to introduce you to Jakku so that you feel like you know it and you must see it for yourself in theaters. And it&#8217;s working.\u00a0Jakku Spy, much like most of the content in the Star Wars app, is meant to build the world of Star Wars. It isn&#8217;t long, and it isn&#8217;t standalone.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It doesn&#8217;t provide hours of interaction in the Star Wars universe, but it&#8217;s a start. And if the last paragraph of the announcement is any indication, that&#8217;s just what Jakku Spy is:\u00a0<span class=\"s1\">&#8220;<\/span>Ultimately, Jakku Spy is the first step into a larger (virtual reality) world for Lucasfilm and\u00a0<i>Star Wars<\/i>,&#8221; said the release.\u00a0&#8220;And that\u2019s something to be truly excited about.&#8221;<span class=\"s1\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Lucasfilm&#8217;s ILMxLAB studio recently released virtual reality content for the official Star Wars mobile apps, marking the first time the beloved sci-fi\u00a0property\u00a0has&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611562,"featured_media":920864,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[246569983,1172,18949,33644298],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920845"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611562"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920845"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920845\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920864"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920845"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920845"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920845"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920851,"date":"2015-12-04T09:28:20","date_gmt":"2015-12-04T17:28:20","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920851"},"modified":"2015-12-04T09:28:20","modified_gmt":"2015-12-04T17:28:20","slug":"yahoo-messenger-too-little-too-late","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/12\/04\/yahoo-messenger-too-little-too-late\/","title":{"rendered":"Will anyone care that Yahoo brought Messenger back from the dead?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>You have to feel bad for the people braving it out in Yahoo&#8217;s offices. First, people say the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2015\/10\/21\/yahoos-business-now-worth-less-than-nothing.html\">most valuable thing<\/a> about Yahoo is its stake in Alibaba. Then, many reports indicate that\u00a0the company&#8217;s board <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-12-02\/yahoo-s-board-to-discuss-sale-of-internet-business-wsj-reports\">is thinking about<\/a> selling off its web businesses. And now? The all-but-forgotten Messenger service\u00a0has\u00a0received a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20151203005030\/en\/Yahoo-Introduces-Yahoo-Messenger-Mobile-Web-Yahoo\">long-delayed revamping<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The new Messenger looks good enough. Yahoo has included some interesting features, like the ability to lump contacts into groups or delete anything from a conversation, into an app that looks like pretty much every other messaging tool. But\u00a0is that enough to convince anyone to use an app they&#8217;ve already abandoned?<\/p>\n<p>There was a time when Yahoo Messenger&#8217;s primary competition was AOL Instant Messenger. (Which, as I learned this morning, apparently\u00a0still exists.) That time has passed. Now, the messaging market is overrun with apps like Facebook Messenger, Google Hangouts, WeChat, and\u00a0many similar services.<\/p>\n<p>This has become something of a theme for Yahoo. Its email service was also quite popular &#8212; now, at least in my experience, its inboxes function mostly as a digital trashcan for notifications from long-abandoned Myspace accounts and spam. That service <a href=\"http:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2015\/10\/15\/yahoo-mail-update\/\">received an update<\/a> similar to Messenger&#8217;s earlier this year.<\/p>\n<p>There are some good ideas tucked into all these updates. Besides the features mentioned above, the new Messenger also deserves special mention because it uses Yahoo&#8217;s other properties to assist in photo-sharing (Flickr) or make it easy for people to search GIFs (Tumblr) without requiring much effort on their part.<\/p>\n<p>The Verge <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2015\/12\/3\/9837816\/yahoo-messenger-relaunches\">reports that<\/a> the new Messenger builds off &#8220;at least 10&#8221; of the acquisitions Yahoo has made since Marissa Mayer became its chief executive. Finding a way to make these <a href=\"https:\/\/pando.com\/2013\/05\/09\/cant-raise-a-series-a-just-sell-yourself-to-yahoo\/\">seemingly haphazard buyouts<\/a> do something useful might just be the most interesting thing about this updated Messenger service.<\/p>\n<p>Still, the fact of the matter is that people are unlikely to use the new Messenger. Most already have a few messaging services on their phone, and unless people resuscitate their Yahoo accounts to be\u00a0more than secondary email addresses, it would be surprising if more than a few diehards gave this app a second chance.<\/p>\n<p>Yahoo was willing to pull Messenger from the brink &#8212; this update comes months after the company <a href=\"https:\/\/help.yahoo.com\/kb\/messenger-iphone\/SLN26152.html\">pulled the app<\/a> from the App Store to &#8220;to better focus on our core and future offerings,&#8221; as it said in a support article. Given that many people probably sought replacements in that time, and that using Yahoo Messenger in 2015 feels a lot like searching the web with AskJeeves, this app seems like a decent idea that&#8217;s arriving a few years too late to make much difference to Yahoo.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You have to feel bad for the people braving it out in Yahoo&#8217;s offices.

Simply put, these are event-driven notifications, usually from other enterprise applications and systems, that surface within the activity stream of an ESS application. Embedded experiences go beyond merely notifying of something important; they also allow one or more actions to be taken to move a business process to the next step.<\/span><\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/chatter-notification-vacation-approval.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-248579\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/chatter-notification-vacation-approval-804x406.png\" alt=\"chatter notification vacation approval\" width=\"804\" height=\"406\" \/><\/a>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Embedded experiences are great, but they have been written in proprietary code tied to a specific ESS vendor\u2019s offering. It has not been possible to reuse actionable notifications across vendors\u2019 solutions.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Google has\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/blog.chromium.org\/2015\/12\/chrome-48-beta-present-to-cast-devices_91.html\" target=\"_blank\">announced<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0a new feature in the latest beta version of its Chrome browser that will provide an open standard alternative for the delivery of extended experiences. Chrome 48 Beta enables developers to quickly create notifications with buttons that let users complete tasks. Those notification can be pushed from browser-based applications and webpages, as well as from Chrome OS applications and extensions to the Chrome browser.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Google and Mozilla employees have contributed to the development of the fledgling <a href=\"http:\/\/notifications.spec.whatwg.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Notifications API standard<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0under the auspices of the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><a href=\"http:\/\/whatwg.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) community<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. This specification is what has been implemented in Google\u2019s Chrome 48 Beta.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A Notification Generator built to define HTML-based embedded experiences has been created by Peter Beverloo. The generator shows how easy it is to define an embedded experience that can appear in any HTML5-compliant web browser.<\/span><\/p>\n<h6 id=\"source-httptests-peter-shnotif\" style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Notification-Generator.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-248580\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Notification-Generator-804x388.png\" alt=\"Notification Generator\" width=\"804\" height=\"388\" \/><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Source: <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/tests.peter.sh\/notification-generator\/#actions=1;;requireInteraction=true\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">http:\/\/tests.peter.sh\/notification-generator\/#actions=1;;requireInteraction=true<\/span><\/a><\/h6>\n<p>As previously noted, embedded experiences have been proprietary to individual vendor\u2019s applications and platforms. Google\u2019s beta implementation of the WHATWG\u2019s Notifications API specification is a first important step toward embedded experiences that will work across operating systems and applications. When the feature is properly vetted and becomes part of the stable release of Chrome (and, we assume, Mozilla\u2019s Firefox browser), open, actionable notifications will be reality.<\/p>\n<p>This is important because it will make the development and use of embedded experiences far more practical and widespread. Enterprise software vendors who choose to implement the WHATWG\u2019s Notifications API specification will empower their customers to more easily create interoperability with other vendors\u2019 browser-based tools.

The process of bringing consumer-inspired technologies into the workplace has been accelerated by the spread of smartphones and tablets imported by employees fed up with antediluvian office tech. We\u2019ve also seen the introduction of applications such as Salesforce\u2019s Chatter and Microsoft\u2019s Yammer, which mimic the likes of Facebook and other social media platforms. The latest phase of this megatrend is the rise of enterprise messaging apps, which have been inspired by hugely successful consumer offerings such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.<\/p>\n<p>Within the corporate world, services such as <a href=\"https:\/\/slack.com\/\">Slack<\/a> and HipChat are spreading fast, which helps explain why the companies behind them have attracted lofty valuations from investors. HipChat\u2019s creator, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.atlassian.com\/\">Atlassian<\/a>, which is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2015\/11\/30\/us-atlassian-ipo-idUSKBN0TJ2M420151130\">preparing to go public<\/a>, set its IPO price range this week at $16.50 to $18.50 a share. A price at the midpoint of that range would value Atlassian at $3.6 billion. One of the reasons the company is attracting so much interest is that enterprise messaging apps are morphing into platforms that have a range of other business applications embedded in them so that people no longer need to leave the chat environment to use other software. This phenomenon has given rise to a new buzzword: \u201cChatOps&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Signs of the shift towards embedded applications in messaging services are multiplying. Atlassian recently revamped the app store associated with its messaging service so that users can embed applications from the store directly into the chat environment. Before the change, HipChat users who got an alert from, say, a customer service application such as Zendesk would have to exit HipChat. Now, they can open the application within it.<\/p>\n<p>Slack, which is being used by more than a million users a day now, is also becoming a platform that attracts other developers. As an example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blockspring.com\/\">Blockspring<\/a> has come up with an application that makes it very easy for a Slack user to build simple bots that can pull data from across the web into a spreadsheet format within the messaging service. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.howdy.ai\/\">Howdy<\/a>, a startup that recently raised $1.5m of funding, has come up with an application that runs automated tasks for teams using Slack. It plans to develop apps for other messaging services too.<\/p>\n<p>More of these services are likely to appear. Facebook recently revealed that Facebook at Work, which lets employees chat with one another on a private social network, now has its own <a href=\"https:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/facebook-beta-launches-work-chat-application\/\">chat client<\/a>,\u00a0too. (Facebook at Work is still in private beta\u00a0with some 300 companies.)<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m not sure which enterprise messaging service (or services) will end up ruling the roost, though Slack is certainly off to a flying start. But I\u2019m confident that ChatOps will become a mainstream way of doing business if enough innovative companies emerge with embedded applications for the various platforms. After all, it makes sense to bring all kinds of applications to a collaboration service rather than trying to inject collaborative capabilities into standalone applications one by one.<\/p>\n<p>The companies that prosper most from the ChatOps trend will be those whose embedded applications are:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Easy To Use &#8211;\u00a0<\/strong>That means providing simple, intuitive interfaces and ensuring that applications integrate smoothly with companies\u2019 internal systems.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Authentically Mobile &#8211;\u00a0<\/strong>This may seem obvious, but all too often mobile applications for companies simply translate desktop functionality to mobile devices rather than tapping their unique capabilities more creatively. (Slack has hinted at the potential here by making it possible for users to book a ride <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.lyft.com\/posts\/slack\">via Lyft<\/a> straight from a chat window.)<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Secure &#8211;\u00a0<\/strong>Applications will need to meet appropriate internal security and privacy standards<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>Data Smart &#8211;\u00a0<\/strong>As well as helping people find internal data they need for their work, embedded chat applications will also need to find, import and integrate relevant information from external sources. The best ones will also gather and display collective organizational knowledge about data sources and business issues.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re still in the early stages of the enterprise messaging movement and there will be bumps in the road ahead. Startups will need to find sustainable business models and be alert to the risk that messaging services could offer their own, competing applications. This kind of competition has surfaced occasionally in consumer markets, but it is widely accepted that businesses such as Facebook and Twitter grew so fast in part because they nurtured vibrant ecosystems of developers. That lesson should not be lost on Slack, HipChat and others. ChatOps represents an exciting opportunity to create new businesses in the enterprise realm that can use a new generation of fast-growing messaging platforms as a springboard to success.<\/p>\n<p><em>Martin Giles is a partner at <a href=\"http:\/\/wing.vc\/\">Wing Venture Capital<\/a> (@Wing_VC).

There&#8217;s just one catch: Doing so prohibits developers from adding support for other ride-hailing services like Gett or Lyft to that same app.<\/p>\n<p>Developers can also sign up for Uber&#8217;s affiliate program, which will allow them to receive $5 for every new user they refer to the service in the United States. It doesn&#8217;t look like developers will\u00a0get paid for rides hailed by existing Uber users.<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch <a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/12\/02\/uber-ride-request-button\/\">reports that Uber policies<\/a> restricting the use of &#8220;the Uber API, Uber API Materials, or Uber Data&#8221; in connection with &#8220;a third party that provides services competitive to Uber\u2019s products and services&#8221; will\u00a0apply to\u00a0this button.<\/p>\n<p>The move\u00a0provides a clear benefit for Uber: Its service can enter\u00a0more apps without having to worry about competitors doing the same. It&#8217;s kinda like asking to be allowed into someone&#8217;s home then demanding they lock the door once you&#8217;re in.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s less\u00a0clear how other developers might\u00a0benefit. Sure, they could\u00a0make money via user referrals, but that&#8217;s a far cry from Uber&#8217;s talk about differentiating an application from its competition by offering a &#8220;magical experience for riders.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Besides, wouldn&#8217;t it be better to allow people to choose which ride-hailing service to use\u00a0than to only support Uber? The company <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/articles\/2014\/03\/28\/uber-s-biggest-problem-isn-t-surge-pricing-what-if-it-s-sexual-harassment-by-drivers.html\">has<\/a> a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.csmonitor.com\/Business\/2015\/0310\/Can-Uber-solve-its-women-problem\">well-documented<\/a> women <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marieclaire.com\/culture\/news\/a14480\/uber-rides-dangerous-for-women\/\">problem<\/a>; should\u00a0developers make it\u00a0the only ride-hailing service in their apps?<\/p>\n<p>That will depend\u00a0on what developers prioritize &#8212; making life easier for as many people as they can; drawing\u00a0the most revenues\u00a0by supporting the\u00a0ride-hailing service with the most fruitful\u00a0referral program; or bowing to Uber&#8217;s dominance.<\/p>\n<p>Not that they currently have other options. No other\u00a0ride-hailing\u00a0service offers a feature like this, and none are keen to talk about the possibility that they might: Neither Gett nor Lyft responded to repeated requests for comment on this post.<\/p>\n<p>All of which means this could be a moot point. What if Uber&#8217;s competitors never attempt something like this? Well, then, it doesn&#8217;t much matter if Uber&#8217;s terms wouldn&#8217;t allow for developers to include something in their apps. No harm done!<\/p>\n<p>Still, that begs the question of why Uber feels the need to include these terms in the first place. If it has no competition in this regard, and it&#8217;s not clear that it ever will compete with other ride-hailing companies in this way, why bother?<\/p>\n<p>An Uber spokesperson\u00a0gave\u00a0the following statement when I requested comment:<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-our-goal-is-to-suppo\"><p>Our goal is to support developers with the tools and resources they need to be successful. We value the user experience and have parameters in place to ensure that the Uber experience is consistent across all apps that utilize our API.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Fair enough, though that doesn&#8217;t really address\u00a0concerns about anti-competitive behavior. Uber&#8217;s still restricting developers from supporting non-existing tools offered by competitive services in exchange for the ability to make Uber money and maybe, eventually, receive\u00a0some of that wealth themselves.

(A baseline was established by looking at installs five minutes before an ad aired.) The company wouldn&#8217;t\u00a0identify\u00a0studied\u00a0apps\u00a0due to\u00a0confidentiality agreements.<\/p>\n<p>Fetch\u00a0said\u00a0app installs rose between 56 and 74 percent when commercials aired, depending on how many times the ad was seen. This shows that &#8220;TV advertising can be the final tipping point to push potential app users to progress into their journeys to becoming app customers,&#8221; Fetch said, &#8220;because we\u2019ve targeted the audience at precisely the time that they are more prone to installing the app.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The company is referring to people&#8217;s habits of holding a smartphone or tablet in their hands while a television set operates in the background. Some companies have tried to take advantage of this trend by offering &#8220;second screen&#8221; apps that augment television viewing instead of hindering it; others use the giant screens to make people aware of apps\u00a0they can download on the devices in their hands.<\/p>\n<p>The effectiveness of television spots depends on several factors. First is when the commercials show: Fetch found that app installs rose 650 percent after ads were shown between midnight and 1am; a similar bump was seen during prime time between 6pm and 7pm. Frequency also mattered &#8212; people were most likely to download an app if they saw a commercial for it at least four times in two hours.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not just that commercials\u00a0drive app installs, either &#8212; these new users can also be quite valuable to developers. &#8220;For most app businesses, organic users are the highest value customers to the business,&#8221; Fetch&#8217;s head of data, Dan Wilson, said in an email. &#8220;Users acquired through TV tend to be closer to the organic users in average value than users acquired through paid mobile media channels.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There are some drawbacks to the report. Many increases are expressed as percentages, which as I explained <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/12\/01\/amazons-celebration-of-record-holiday-weekend-sales-is-short-on-details\/\">when Amazon touted<\/a> its holiday shopping successes, don&#8217;t mean as much when people aren&#8217;t told\u00a0the starting figure. It&#8217;s also not clear if these results would hold true for all businesses, or if there&#8217;s something about Fetch&#8217;s clients that makes them more likely to benefit here.<\/p>\n<p>Wilson cited agreements requiring Fetch to keep company data anonymous when asked about specific companies&#8217; increases following television spots. He did say that FetchMe, the tool used to conduct this study, is used to monitor more than 1 billion interactions each month across 100 countries. So at least we know this didn&#8217;t affect just a handful of companies during a short period of time.<\/p>\n<p>People see advertisements all the time. But apparently there&#8217;s something about television sets that makes people care more about seeing an app there than they might if they saw it on a social network or in a banner ad shown\u00a0on a Web page. Using a phone might not improve the television viewing experience, but having the television set provide background noise can apparently help app discovery.<\/p>\n<p>What a weird world.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A new report has found that television commercials are great at convincing people to download mobile apps\u00a0&#8212; provided they show at the&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611561,"featured_media":884740,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359216066,359234179,359234180],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920844"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611561"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920844"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920844\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/884740"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920844"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920844"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920844"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920841,"date":"2015-12-02T09:16:49","date_gmt":"2015-12-02T17:16:49","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920841"},"modified":"2015-12-02T09:16:49","modified_gmt":"2015-12-02T17:16:49","slug":"with-blue-shade-amazon-copies-oysters-best-feature","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/12\/02\/with-blue-shade-amazon-copies-oysters-best-feature\/","title":{"rendered":"With Blue Shade, Amazon copies Oyster&#8217;s best feature"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Amazon is taking one of the best features from Oyster, the book-reading service that shut down in September, and making it available on its Kindle Fire devices.<\/p>\n<p>Much of Oyster&#8217;s team joined Google in September to improve that company&#8217;s Google Books service. At the time,\u00a0the company&#8217;s co-founders <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.oysterbooks.com\/\">said they planned<\/a> to &#8220;sunset the existing Oyster service over the next several months,&#8221; and a note on the service&#8217;s website says that particular sun <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oysterbooks.com\/boh7IeY7\">will finally set<\/a> in January 2016.<\/p>\n<p>In response to that news, I <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/09\/22\/a-eulogy-for-oyster-the-indie-ebook-startup-not-afraid-of-amazon\/\">wrote a eulogy for<\/a> Oyster&#8217;s willingness to experiment with new features while competing with Amazon and its control on bookselling. Among the things I would miss the most: A feature that reduced the amount of blue light shown by a device whenever someone wanted to read late in the night.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the feature Amazon is rolling out to its Kindle Fire devices starting today. Amazon\u00a0is calling the feature Blue Shade, and it&#8217;s included in an over-the-air update to the Android-based operating system that powers Amazon&#8217;s tablets. (That update, like many software updates nowadays, costs nothing to install.)<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Blue Shade uses specialized filters to limit exposure to blue light. It also offers warm color filters and the ability to lower the display brightness to an ultra-low level for comfortable nighttime reading\u2014even in a dark room,&#8221; Amazon said in an emailed\u00a0statement. &#8220;Customers can also fine-tune the color settings to their personal preference, with the device intelligently adjusting the color filtering so that at any color or brightness, the blue wavelength light is always suppressed.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Tools\u00a0which limit the amount of blue light cast off by a device are popular. A desktop utility\u00a0called F.lux has been downloaded <a href=\"https:\/\/recode.net\/2015\/11\/16\/apple-tells-screen-dimming-software-f-lux-to-shut-down-its-ios-version\/\">a reported 15 million times<\/a>, and was popular on iOS devices until Apple told its development team to nix the app. Other software tools often include a &#8220;night mode&#8221; to\u00a0serve a similar purpose.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Studies have shown that evening exposure to blue light from tablets may suppress our bodies\u2019 production of melatonin,&#8221; Amazon said in its press release, &#8220;which can prolong the time it takes to fall asleep, delay REM sleep, and reduce the level of alertness the next morning.&#8221; Blue Shade is supposed to fix that issue.<\/p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see when Blue Shade makes its way to other platforms. Despite the popularity of its Kindle Fire tablets during the holiday shopping season, I suspect that the majority of Kindle users read on devices which don&#8217;t bear the Seattle-based company&#8217;s smiling logo stamped on their plastic chassis.<\/p>\n<p>I asked an Amazon spokesperson whether and when Blue Shade might jump to other platforms but haven&#8217;t yet received a response. I&#8217;ll update this post if I do.<\/p>\n<p>There are still some issues that might prevent people from reading e-books. Some might oppose Amazon&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/08\/18\/dont-be-surprised-at-how-amazon-treats-its-workers\/\">business practices<\/a>; others might fear the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/science\/maria-konnikova\/being-a-better-online-reader\">loss of comprehension<\/a> suffered when reading an e-book instead of a physical book; and still others <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/business\/archive\/2014\/01\/the-decline-of-the-american-book-lover\/283222\/\">might not be interested<\/a> in reading a book no matter the\u00a0form it takes.<\/p>\n<p>But now at least one of the best features introduced by a startup that ultimately failed to take down (or even stand toe-to-toe with) its Goliath won&#8217;t be cast aside. Here&#8217;s to hoping that features similar to Lumin and Blue Shade make their way to other reading platforms &#8212; iBooks, Pocket, Instapaper &#8212; in the near future.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Amazon is taking one of the best features from Oyster, the book-reading service that shut down in September, and making it available&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611561,"featured_media":587185,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920841"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611561"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920841"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920841\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/587185"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920841"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920841"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920841"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":941000,"date":"2015-12-02T07:03:23","date_gmt":"2015-12-02T15:03:23","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/?p=248569"},"modified":"2016-02-25T13:34:48","modified_gmt":"2016-02-25T21:34:48","slug":"striking-a-balance-between-security-and-productivity-an-impossible-dream","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/12\/02\/striking-a-balance-between-security-and-productivity-an-impossible-dream\/","title":{"rendered":"Striking a balance between security and productivity \u2014 an impossible dream?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Security and personal productivity do not make comfortable bedfellows. To understand why goes to the roots of what\u00a0business is all about.<\/p>\n<p>Business can be measured in two ways: effectiveness and efficiency. Effectiveness refers to doing the right things, for\u00a0example creating the right products and services, or closing the necessary number of sales.<\/p>\n<p>Efficiency means doing things right, that is, achieving results without unnecessary overheads. In personal terms this\u00a0equates to productivity \u2014 or, simply put, how much time is spent in a day achieving results, versus doing things with no\u00a0apparent business value?<\/p>\n<p>Security often appears the enemy of such personal productivity, creating what can seem to be unnecessary barriers to\u00a0getting the job done. And sometimes, it looks like business effectiveness itself has been sacrificed on the altar of over-bearing security.<\/p>\n<p>I remember one organization I worked for, back in the day, that banned the use of floppy disks for file transfers. The\u00a0rationale made sense from a security perspective \u2014 such transfers were a major contributor to the transmission of\u00a0computer viruses. But for an administrative department whose business relied on file transfers, it meant that productivity\u00a0took a major hit.<\/p>\n<p>Things are so much more complicated these days, of course. Via the Internet, every computer is connected to every other;\u00a0we have phones that can store large enough volumes of data to run entire companies.<\/p>\n<p>And meanwhile, in infrastructure terms we see fragmentation at all levels. While the buzzword might be convergence, in\u00a0reality this has led to a nightmare of integration work. We have created for ourselves a leaky bucket.<\/p>\n<p>The security risks of such a complex environment are genuine and need to be addressed. But does this mean that we are\u00a0doomed to becoming increasingly unproductive? Or is there an alternative answer which enables both security and\u00a0productivity to be achieved?<\/p>\n<p>There is an answer, but not necessarily where people might first look. This is not about striking some kind of arbitrary\u00a0balance between making things secure and allowing people to be productive.<\/p>\n<p>Rather, this is about being clear on <a href=\"http:\/\/smbz.us\/21rR7iq\">what you want to secure<\/a>. Technology, in all its complex and far-reaching glory, is a\u00a0distraction from the main event \u2014 the information that it creates, processes and communicates.<\/p>\n<p>Information is an organization\u2019s most important asset, it has been said. But not all information is created equal. Some is\u00a0business critical; some incorporates intellectual property; some is subject to compliance criteria.<\/p>\n<p>Understanding what information you need, and why it matters, does not have to be an onerous task. While organizations\u00a0may struggle to get on top of all of their \u2018information assets\u2019 they can nonetheless identify a core of information that is of\u00a0particular importance to the business.<\/p>\n<p>Such understanding goes a long way to creating a suitable response, as it enables the right trade-offs to be made. A clear\u00a0example is in <a href=\"http:\/\/smbz.us\/21rQWDE\">healthcare<\/a>, where patient information absolutely should be subject to far more stringent criteria than, say, the\u00a0menu in the staff canteen.<\/p>\n<p>In security architecture <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/1780172206\/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_aCWxwb1VHMASJ\">speak<\/a>, this is called \u2018separation of concerns\u2019. In layman\u2019s terms, this means providing access\u00a0mechanisms, policies and roles appropriate to the information.<\/p>\n<p>It may be, for example, that customer information can only be accessed on personal mobile devices via a locked-down\u00a0app. Or that certain systems can only be accessed via a virtual private network (VPN), accessible only to certain people.<\/p>\n<p>The bottom line is that we cannot expect everything to be accessible everywhere, nor that everything can be locked down\u00a0to the same level of security. Taking such a stance can only end in failure.<\/p>\n<p>By focusing on information first we can identify what cannot be compromised, before considering where compromises can\u00a0be made. The old adage \u201cbalance in all things\u201d should only be applied once the organization\u2019s confidential assets have\u00a0been understood.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Security and personal productivity do not make comfortable bedfellows.

It drew attention to a day I wouldn&#8217;t have known about while prompting me to &#8220;see how others are giving back.&#8221; I might have ignored the whole thing if Facebook&#8217;s choice of words &#8212; &#8220;our communities&#8221; and &#8220;we care about&#8221; &#8212; didn&#8217;t make me pause to consider their implications.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook has been a little creepier than usual lately. It keeps telling me that it cares about me, or that it thinks I&#8217;ll like a photo it plucked from social oblivion with its\u00a0On This Day feature, which is supposed to compel me to share things I&#8217;ve already shared out of some prompted feeling\u00a0of technological nostalgia.<\/p>\n<p>Some have said these prompts are supposed to make people share more stuff on Facebook. The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/facebook-prods-users-to-share-a-bit-more-1446520723\">reported in November<\/a> that this was the case based on Global Web Index statistics showing that users\u00a0are posting to Facebook less even though they\u00a0visit the social network several times throughout the day.<\/p>\n<p>Jackdaw Research&#8217;s Jan Dawson\u00a0agrees. &#8220;Ironically, Facebook needs real human beings to create content to make it a useful and meaningful service to use, and even though these are machine-based prompts, they still require humans to actually post something for their friends to see,&#8221; he said in an emailed response.<\/p>\n<p>But the language used in these prompts has me considering another possibility: Facebook is using these images to humanize its service and seem more relatable, instead of like a cold, algorithm-driven social network that sucks content into its service in much the same way a mosquito draws blood from a person&#8217;s\u00a0flesh.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Screen-Shot-2015-12-01-at-1.36.48-PM.png\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-920834 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Screen-Shot-2015-12-01-at-1.36.48-PM-804x392.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-12-01 at 1.36.48 PM\" width=\"804\" height=\"392\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Screen-Shot-2015-12-01-at-1.36.48-PM-804x392.png 804w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Screen-Shot-2015-12-01-at-1.36.48-PM-300x146.png 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Screen-Shot-2015-12-01-at-1.36.48-PM-968x472.png 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Screen-Shot-2015-12-01-at-1.36.48-PM-210x102.png 210w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Screen-Shot-2015-12-01-at-1.36.48-PM-320x156.png 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Screen-Shot-2015-12-01-at-1.36.48-PM-640x312.png 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Screen-Shot-2015-12-01-at-1.36.48-PM.png 1004w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 804px) 100vw, 804px\" \/><\/a>\n<p>That humanization could make it easier to share things with Facebook. People want to feel like they have an audience &#8212; being told that Facebook\u00a0cares about &#8220;you and the memories you share here&#8221; could offer\u00a0all the audience they need. Creepy? Yes. Effective? If it wasn&#8217;t Facebook would&#8217;ve already nixed the feature.<\/p>\n<p>It is kind of funny that Facebook is testing these features now, while it&#8217;s also working to dehumanize the workers powering its M utility, which can be used for everything from finding a restaurant to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/mathonan\/using-parrots-to-pull-the-curtain-back-on-facebooks-m#.bdvpdMrje\">sending parrots to a colleague&#8217;s office<\/a>. The tool can do everything! But it <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/facebook-m-uses-human-employees-2015-8\">relies on human workers<\/a> for many functions.<\/p>\n<p>Given that people are handing over their information to M and conversing with it the same way human beings always converse with digital facsimiles &#8212; with humor and candor not shared with actual people &#8212; it makes sense that Facebook wouldn&#8217;t call attention to the fact that it&#8217;s far different from Siri or Google Now.<\/p>\n<p>This means Facebook is trying to humanize algorithms while it hides actual humans behind a veneer of artificial intelligence. (If only &#8220;algorithmize&#8221; were a word.) One convinces people to share more with the public; the other makes them\u00a0more candid than they might be if they knew they were talking to a person.<\/p>\n<p>How people react to these efforts depends on their disposition. Some people are more comfortable when a service tries to humanize itself; others, like me, are just kind of weirded out that a digital behemoth wants me to think it&#8217;s human. Either way it seems like Facebook is trying to\u00a0blur the lines between machine and person in ways that allow it to get the most out of its billion-plus users.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment. (And here all these images keep telling me that the company cares about me.) I&#8217;ll update this post if someone at the company emails me back and offers an on-the-record statement.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Someone\u00a0might think that Black Friday, Small Business Saturday, and Cyber Monday would be enough pseudo-holidays for the week following Thanksgiving.

Even as we become more connected, more and more people are choosing to live in cities. The World Health Organization <a href=\"http:\/\/www.who.int\/gho\/urban_health\/situation_trends\/urban_population_growth_text\/en\/\">estimates<\/a> that worldwide 54% of people live in cities (this up from 34% only a generation ago). <\/p>\n<p><strong>What improves?<\/strong><br \/>\nOne constant in the discussion of smart cities is a focus on end user experiences rather than technology itself. Working that through Marx raised an important question which a large number of IoT implementations will have to deal with. As IoT is inherently passive, and requires additional effort to implement, the questions of what are you going to actually do (switch traffic lights more efficiently, <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2015\/09\/24\/airports-and-the-internet-of-everything\/?cid=smc-eb-ern-0415-10001124\">direct airport passengers to the shortest TSA lines<\/a>, change power sources, manage toll pricing dynamically etc.), and how you measure improvement, become key. It\u2019s much easier to feel excited about technology or new services if you can do something you couldn\u2019t do before (share a photo with a single click, stalk your ex-girlfriend without having to embarrass yourself by talking to anyone else, <a href=\"http:\/\/smbz.us\/1LLybzB\">monitor your health with a wearable<\/a> and so on). These were novel experiences. For many IoT will incrementally improve things. <\/p>\n<p>Marx commented that if he delivered a 14-17% improvement in traffic congestion, would people notice, and how would they think about it? Traffic is a moderately self regulating system. In gridlocked traffic, people who don\u2019t have to go out in a car, don\u2019t. As soon as a system improves people will go out. It\u2019s entirely possible that a 15% improvement in performance will be reflected in 15% more cars per unit time, but not necessarily an overall reduction in journey time (i.e. more efficient packing of goods\/people\/things might reduce variability, and improve total system throughput). To be seen as a success the system likely needs to deliver clear individual value.<\/p>\n<p>Autonomous and smart(er) cars being guided through the traffic congestion create another layer of connectivity challenges. You won\u2019t want to get into a new car when you cross the border between the cities of Los Angeles and Santa Monica. This is not so much about connecting things as connecting systems. The water system needs to talk to the power system, traffic has multiple systems (and more in geographies with toll roads and congestion charges). How can you ensure that an autonomous agent works in an optimized way across a route?<\/p>\n<p><strong>The internet of \u2026 trees?<\/strong><br \/>\nIt\u2019s not the internet of things, or even the internet of everything, apparently it\u2019s the internet of trees. Los Angeles has a surprisingly large number of trees, and strict rules about replacing them if repair work requires removing them. The city expects that in the next year there will be 200,000 new trees planted, all of which will be tracked with sensors. In comparison Los Angeles has 45,000 connected traffic signals, and another 28,000 pedestrian lights.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How do you connect the dots?<\/strong><br \/>\nConnecting trees, traffic lights water systems and cars is driving new set of capabilities focused on lower bandwidth communications. Samsung and others have invested in Sigfox, with LoRa alliance presenting itself as an alternative. Of these two, Sigfix appears more focused on smaller messages, with LoRa, based on more traditional cellular technology focused on bigger and bi-directional messages (<a href=\"http:\/\/rethink-iot.com\/2015\/03\/20\/on-lpwans-why-sigfox-and-lora-are-rather-different-and-the-importance-of-the-business-model\/\">nice comparison of the two<\/a>). It seems likely that these systems will be driving smart capabilities at the edge, so for example, traffic lights will be driven by algorithms at the light, fed by just enough overall system information, rather than relying on a central connection for every decision. That said the more interconnected the systems, the higher the chance that centralized capabilities and communications will be important- this will be an interesting area to watch. Data collection might work the same way, in a previous <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1lawEOe\">blog<\/a> in this sponsored series my colleague Jon Collins discussions some of the issues relating to IoT and local data.<\/p>\n<p>It was great to hear from someone on the edge (pun intended) deploying IoT capabilities in the real world. The challenges faced connected multiple interconnected systems in a smart way are becoming clear, and we are starting to see solutions. How big will those trees be by the time every city is smart?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At the launch of Orange Silicon Valley\u2019s new IoT lab last week, Peter Marx, the CTO of Los Angeles, spoke about some&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87877999,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[40962455,359256358,2562683],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/941001"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87877999"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=941001"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/941001\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=941001"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=941001"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=941001"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920838,"date":"2015-12-01T13:54:12","date_gmt":"2015-12-01T21:54:12","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920838"},"modified":"2015-12-02T07:51:56","modified_gmt":"2015-12-02T15:51:56","slug":"zuckerberg-and-chan-plan-to-give-away-facebook-shares","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/12\/01\/zuckerberg-and-chan-plan-to-give-away-facebook-shares\/","title":{"rendered":"Zuckerberg plans to give away 99% of Facebook shares"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/notes\/mark-zuckerberg\/a-letter-to-our-daughter\/10153375081581634\">plan\u00a0to give away<\/a> 99 percent of their shares in the social networking company &#8212; which are collectively\u00a0worth somewhere around\u00a0$45 billion &#8212; throughout\u00a0their lives.<\/p>\n<p>Zuckerberg revealed the news in a letter to his daughter published on Facebook.

We&#8217;d envisioned it as the realization of the EPCOT dream &#8212; a connected world with no borders in which we&#8217;d be able to reach, interact with, and learn from one another without barriers. In reality, a look at nearly any comments section will quickly zap much of your remaining optimism about the benefits of this so-called open forum.<\/p>\n<p>However, education startup\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.penpalschools.com\/\">PenPal Schools<\/a>\u00a0is looking to make good on those\u00a0early promises\u00a0by\u00a0bringing back one key component that technology seems to have eclipsed: the human element.<\/p>\n<p>The startup offers an\u00a0online platform used by\u00a0over 70,000 pen pals in over 90 countries that connects students and individual learners with pen pals in other states or countries. It&#8217;s free and built for use by any and everyone who wants to participate in an exchange, whether it&#8217;s through a class at school or on an individual level. The goal of the service is to provide students with coursework that will expand their education while also providing insight into the culture, lives, and learning process of students in another region.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We see our program as oftentimes so eye-opening for students, and it&#8217;s their first glimpse into culture and understanding a way of life so different from our own,&#8221; says PenPal Schools founder\u00a0Joe Troyen, adding that the startup recently rolled out a suite of new apps and features for the\u00a0education\u00a0platform that reinforces a mobile-first strategy that takes into account the limited Internet connectivity throughout the world&#8217;s many classrooms.<\/p>\n<p>Pen pal exchanges have been a great way to connect people from across cultures for decades, and it&#8217;s on the foundation of exchanges like those that society built early universities and formal education. Troyen says the platform his startup has developed is no different from the collaborative exchanges of yore, except that technology has allowed for innovation focused on the education aspect. &#8220;[One] big innovation is curriculum. We connect students to not only write back and forth to each other as they did in the old days, but also to learn together through online, interactive courses,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"beyond-textbooks-and-news-arti\">Beyond textbooks and news articles<\/h4>\n<p>PenPal Schools offers several courses that focus on current events, culture and traditions, and the historical struggle against discrimination. In these courses, learners are paired up with a pen pal from another state or country who is taking the same course. Through correspondence that revolves around a guided curriculum, learners can exchange ideas and perspectives around certain topics and content.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/PenPalSchools_Argentina_Studentsedit.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-920836 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/PenPalSchools_Argentina_Studentsedit-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"PenPalSchools_Argentina_Studentsedit\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" data-attribution=\"Courtesy of PenPal Schools\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/PenPalSchools_Argentina_Studentsedit-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/PenPalSchools_Argentina_Studentsedit-804x603.jpg 804w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/PenPalSchools_Argentina_Studentsedit-968x726.jpg 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/PenPalSchools_Argentina_Studentsedit-187x140.jpg 187w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/PenPalSchools_Argentina_Studentsedit-320x240.jpg 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/PenPalSchools_Argentina_Studentsedit-640x480.jpg 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/PenPalSchools_Argentina_Studentsedit-200x150.jpg 200w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/PenPalSchools_Argentina_Studentsedit.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a>\n<p>Troyen gives me the example of Brendan from New Jersey and Moneer from Kabul, Afghanistan. Through their guided exchanges, they discussed news items and current events where they live. One of the topics of conversation? Ongoing U.S. presence in Afghanistan. Because their personal experiences with the war in the Middle East are dramatically different, Brendan began to view the war in a new light. On the flip side, Moneer got some insight into the way the war is perceived by many in the United States and helped Brendan gain a new understanding of what, exactly, U.S. troops were doing in Afghanistan and why they were doing it.<\/p>\n<p>The obvious question is this: how, exactly, does PenPal Schools improve upon the age-old, time-honored tradition of simply writing letters? Surely there are other places connecting pen pals digitally in the name of swapping knowledge. How&#8217;s this any different?\u00a0While there are other sites matching up pen pals, the PenPal Schools difference lies in the way in which they&#8217;re leveraging technology and simplicity to create the best platform for both connecting and learning.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;PenPal Schools is the first to combine high quality curriculum and the best technology with multi-week 1-to-1 pen pal exchanges, which all adds up to a great experience for learners,&#8221; says Troyen. &#8220;We\u2019re focused on providing a simple, fun experience with the kind of support students and teachers can\u2019t find anywhere else.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The proof, as they say, is in the pudding. Or, in this case, in the completion rate. While most online courses see a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.katyjordan.com\/MOOCproject.html\" target=\"_blank\">completion rates<\/a> under 20\u00a0percent, the average rate for PenPal Schools is at\u00a088 percent, the company tells me.<\/p>\n<p>In taking courses through PenPal Schools, students receive weekly assignments replete with instructional texts, videos, and prompts designed to kick-start the conversation. From there, pen pals communicate via a chat-like interface. There&#8217;s no limit to the number of students who can take a course at a time, and students from all over the world can participate. For security reasons, classroom students are paired with other classroom students while individuals are paired up with other individuals. No personally identifying information is exchanged or revealed, and pen pals are always matched with someone close to his or her own age.<\/p>\n<p>For now, all communication is written, but looking forward, Troyen says that PenPal Schools plans to offer video messaging and collaborative tools. That seems fairly logical, considering the penetration mobile chat apps (WhatsApp, Snapchat, Kik, Facebook Messenger, etc.) have had in the last couple years, especially as many of those apps attempt to integrate ways to follow and discuss the news directly from those digital conversations.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ll continue to focus on asynchronous communication because it\u2019s easier for teachers to coordinate, works across time zones, enables students to learn at their own pace, and meet the needs of learners who may not always have reliable internet access,&#8221; says Troyen.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"pulling-a-toms%c2%a0shoes-for-\">Pulling a &#8220;TOMS\u00a0Shoes&#8221; for education<\/h4>\n<p>Speaking of access, not every student or school has the funds available to participate in such a country-scaling education platform. Yet, if money is the main barrier to entry, PenPal Schools wouldn&#8217;t be nearly as potent as it would limit the diverse background of students.<\/p>\n<p>Troyen also mentions that the plan going forward is to offer premium courses for a fee. While all of PenPal Schools&#8217; original courses will remain on offer for free, these courses will offer premium features and content with the help of partners like textbook publishers. The fee structure will be designed around the concept of &#8220;buy one, give one&#8221;, meaning that when someone pays the fee for a premium course, a student who may not otherwise have access to the funds necessary to enroll will be able to participate.<\/p>\n<p>And participation certainly seems to be enjoying some seriously mounting interest. Troyen tells me that just last week, nearly 200 new teachers from more than 20 different countries enrolled in PenPal Schools. The vast majority of PenPal Schools&#8217; growth comes through word-of-mouth amongst teachers, making educators by far one of its most valuable assets.<\/p>\n<p>The startup&#8217;s monetization strategy also involves partnerships with well-known education publishing companies, with PenPal Schools collaborating to create courses that compliment the learning process from teacher instruction, textbooks, and other interactive lessons. (For example, you&#8217;d gain access to a specific PenPal Schools course when purchasing a new set of textbooks for a class.) Beyond that, the startup also wants to move into new subjects to generate additional revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Although\u00a0the current crop of courses focus on history, culture, and current events, Troyen says\u00a0PenPal Schools will soon offer\u00a0new\u00a0classes for\u00a0persuasive writing and language-learning. And in the future, PenPal Schools courses could\u00a0expand to\u00a0non-traditional subjects, like music and cooking.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There was a time, back in the early 90&#8217;s, in the days of AOL,\u00a0You&#8217;ve Got Mail, and dial-up modems, when something of&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611562,"featured_media":920837,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[39170,1342,359234173,359234172],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920832"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611562"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920832"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920832\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920837"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920832"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920832"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920832"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":941003,"date":"2015-12-01T08:32:34","date_gmt":"2015-12-01T16:32:34","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/?p=248562"},"modified":"2015-12-01T08:32:34","modified_gmt":"2015-12-01T16:32:34","slug":"weshare-moves-toward-file-transfer-as-a-microservice","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/12\/01\/weshare-moves-toward-file-transfer-as-a-microservice\/","title":{"rendered":"WeTransfer Moves Toward File Transfer as a Microservice"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It shouldn\u2019t be news that enterprise file storage, sync, and sharing software and services (EFSS) have largely become a commodity. Prices continue to fall, in part because providers\u2019 storage costs are still decreasing. More importantly, their cost to actually transfer a file has always been negligible, even with the application of strong encryption.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With costs low and decreasing, it&#8217;s fair to ask which of the aspects of file storage, sync, and sharing creates enough value for customers that providers can charge for the service. When you stop and think about it, the sharing or transfer of the file has always been the action that the rest of the bundled offer hangs on, especially for cloud-based services. A file can\u2019t be stored on a provider\u2019s servers until a copy has been transferred there. Similarly, changes to files must be transferred to keep copies in sync. The vast majority of the value proposition clearly lies in the transfer (sharing) of the file.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So it makes sense for the file transfer element to be the focal point for providers\u2019 monetization strategies. If you accept that premise, then the next logical conclusion to be made is that file transfer can be monetized as a stand-alone service. In today\u2019s world, that service would be built and licensed as a microservice, which can be used in any application that can call a RESTful API.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wetransfer.com\/about\" target=\"_blank\">WeTransfer<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, a company based in Amsterdam (despite claiming San Francisco as its headquarters), has <a href=\"http:\/\/press.gettyimages.com\/wetransfer-launches-new-api-with-istock-by-getty-images-as-their-inaugural-api-partner\/\" target=\"_blank\">announced<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0today the first step toward the creation of such a commercially-available file transfer microservice. A new partnership makes WeTransfer\u2019s file transfer service an option (alongside Dropbox) for delivering photos and videos purchased from Getty Image\u2019s iStock library. WeTransfer works in the background while the customer remains in iStock.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">WeTransfer has exposed its file transfer API to Getty Images only at this point, but will be able strike up similar partnerships with other providers of graphics services. Of course, WeTransfer could also license API access to <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">any<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> developer looking to incorporate file transfer into an application. While it isn\u2019t clear from their statement today if and when that will happen, the possibility is very real and quite compelling.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It\u2019s important to note that both Box and Dropbox have made their file sharing APIs commercially available to developers for several months now, so WeTransfer is playing catch up in this regard. However, WeTransfer has emphasized file sharing almost exclusively since its founding in 2009 as a web-based service that only stores a file being shared for seven days before deleting it from their servers. Dropbox, on the other hand, originally was popular because of its simple-but-effective sync feature, and Box was initially perceived as a cloud-based storage service.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The potential market for file transfer microservices is so young and large that no provider has a clear advantage at this point. The recent <a href=\"http:\/\/curia.europa.eu\/jcms\/upload\/docs\/application\/pdf\/2015-10\/cp150117en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">nullification of the Safe Harbor agreement<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0(PDF) between the European Union and the United States also presents a significant challenge to file services vendors that provide file storage for a global and multinational customer base. If WeTransfer emphasizes its legacy as an easy-to-use, dependable file transfer-only service with its newly-created microservice, it could gain a larger share of the market and expand well beyond its current niche of creative professional customers.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It shouldn\u2019t be news that enterprise file storage, sync, and sharing software and services (EFSS) have largely become a commodity.

And while that&#8217;s all well and good, these theoretical deals are often unenforceable and rely on truthful reporting of carbon emissions (Hey, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2015\/nov\/04\/china-underreporting-coal-consumption-by-up-to-17-data-suggests\">China<\/a>!).<\/p>\n<p>So I was thrilled that this year&#8217;s conference opened not with arguments about emissions cuts but with Bill Gates&#8217; plan to address climate change, which has nothing to do with with making cuts and everything to do with how to empower markets to make those cuts themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Gates&#8217; announcement does two\u00a0things. First, it <a href=\"http:\/\/www.greentechmedia.com\/articles\/read\/bill-gates-launches-historic-commitment-to-scale-clean-energy-breakthroughs\">leads a 28 person<\/a> investment team to provide capital to help promising energy companies get products to market, crossing the so called investing valley of death where many great clean energy innovations die. Second, he appears to have convinced 20 governments to double their energy budgets for basic research. No mention of emissions cuts in any of these announcements.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t believe that market interventions like cap and trade and subsidies can help the process. And in terms of fairness, I&#8217;ve long argued and shown that fossil fuels have been <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2012\/04\/17\/the-politicization-of-cleantech-the-history-of-energy-subsidies\/\">subsidized <\/a>for the last 100 years. It&#8217;s just that what Gates truly gets is that taxing carbon\u00a0<em>is not enough.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>What the world needs to address climate change is a Manhattan Project like effort to figure out clean energy solutions that are cheaper than fossil fuels. When that happens the market will expedite deployment of renewables quickly and efficiently. And the only way to get those clean energy solutions to market is to heavily invest in the basic scientific breakthroughs that will be required to cleanly meet growing energy demand.<\/p>\n<p>The reality is that doubling countries&#8217;\u00a0commitments to energy R&amp;D isn&#8217;t nearly enough. What&#8217;s actually needed is closer to a 10X increase, which isn&#8217;t that crazy when you consider the U.S. only spends $5.3 billion on energy research. Taking that up to $50 billion would put the budget where it should be&#8211;more than what\u00a0we spend on health care R&amp;D but in the same ballpark. Think of it as health care for the earth.<\/p>\n<p>Gates <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gatesnotes.com\/Energy\/Investing-in-Energy-Innovation\">authored a paper <\/a>that he released Monday, that more or less outlines his thinking on climate change and clean energy technology and investment. It&#8217;s a concise, intelligent read and I&#8217;d point out two tables Gates presents.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Graphic1.Gates_.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-248560 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Graphic1.Gates_.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"613\" height=\"253\" \/><\/a>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Graphic2.Gates_.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-248561 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/12\/Graphic2.Gates_.png\" alt=\"Graphic2.Gates\" width=\"600\" height=\"211\" \/><\/a>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The data tells the story and it&#8217;s not that complicated. The federal government is a massive underinvestor in energy research and development. The only one that&#8217;s\u00a0really worse is the energy industry itself, which spends a minuscule 0.23 percent on research.<\/p>\n<p>In my time as a cleantech analyst, people sometimes have asked me what I think the world needs to address climate change. And while a carbon tax would be nice or a breakthrough in energy storage would be even nicer, what always sprang to mind as I stared at the 300 plus billion market cap for Exxon Mobil was a 300 billion dollar clean energy company. In fact, I&#8217;d take 3 or 4 of them for good measure.<\/p>\n<p>Commitments to emissions cuts aren&#8217;t going to give me my dreamed of competitors for Exxon Mobil and Occidental.

Kindle e-readers are also said to have surged in popularity.<\/p>\n<p>These claims <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/amazon-curtails-development-of-consumer-devices-1440632203\">follow layoffs<\/a> at Lab126 (the division of Amazon responsible for the company&#8217;s hardware) said to be the result of the Fire Phone&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/3040383\/following-fire-phone-flop-big-changes-at-amazons-lab126\">spectacular flop<\/a>. The division was also reorganized, and its parent company halted development on some of its more ambitious projects, according to the Wall Street Journal.<\/p>\n<p>Since then Amazon has released a $50 tablet, which has become the most popular device in the product line&#8217;s history. The company even <a href=\"http:\/\/qz.com\/504045\/amazon-is-now-selling-cheap-tablets-by-the-six-pack\/\">sold the devices<\/a> in a six-pack, making it clear to consumers that they could buy a half-dozen Amazon tablets as gifts for the same price as one tablet from another company.<\/p>\n<p>Then there&#8217;s the Fire TV Stick, which costs just $39 and promises access to all the streaming services a person might ever want to peruse. That&#8217;s more than Google&#8217;s Chromecast, but thanks to Amazon&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/10\/05\/amazon-will-stop-selling-apple-tvs-and-chromecasts-so-what\/\">decision to pull that product<\/a> from its virtual shelves, that $39 price tag\u00a0probably seemed like a steal to shoppers.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s no surprise\u00a0these products were the top-selling items on Amazon over the holiday weekend. Both are cheap devices with a recognizable brand that people can gift to their loved ones without breaking the bank. Tis the season to\u00a0rake in customers with great deals, after all, and nobody&#8217;s better than Amazon at that.<\/p>\n<p>Yet the fact remains that <a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/12\/01\/lies-damned-lies-and-amazon-holiday-metrics\/\">we have no idea<\/a> what any of this actually means for the company. Just look at its claim that it sold six times as many Fire TV products this holiday shopping weekend as it did during the same weekend last year. Does that it mean it sold 6 million this year? How about 42 million? Nobody knows!<\/p>\n<p>Other claims, like its devices being the most popular items on its website, are also dubious. When a store\u00a0offers as many products as Amazon does, it&#8217;s likely that shoppers are buying a wide array of items instead of focusing on specific products. The popularity of Amazon&#8217;s hardware could&#8217;ve been a direct result of that hardware&#8217;s cheapness and Amazon&#8217;s willingness to plaster it all over its site.<\/p>\n<p>All of which means that Amazon&#8217;s might as well have said &#8220;We had a record holiday shopping weekend!&#8221; and ended the press release there.

It\u2019s unclear whether it was\u00a0a mere coincidence, but what isn\u2019t hard to believe is just how much the battle to become the dominant communications protocol in consumer IoT is drawing in every big IT player from Apple to Samsung to ARM.<\/p>\n<p>To review, what\u2019s going on here is that\u00a0there are a number of competing protocols in consumer IoT. Bluetooth and Thread are just two. There\u2019s also Apple\u2019s HomeKit, which is really a made for iOS certification program, as well as Google\u2019s newly announced Weave, IoTivity (backed by Intel) and the open source AllJoyn.<\/p>\n<p>The protocols differ on many levels. Some of the differentiators include\u00a0reported power characteristics, whether they enable true mesh networking, proprietary vs.\u00a0open source, and\u00a0IP requirements\u00a0intrinsic to the alliances they\u2019ve formed.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s obvious that not all will survive, though what may be less obvious to those backing each protocol is that the proliferation of certification programs and competing protocols will actually bring folks further away from the dreamed goal for the smarthome: true device to device interoperability that&#8217;s easy to enable. At least that\u2019s true in the short term. If a dominant networking protocol emerges in the home, as WiFi did a decade ago, that protocol could really create a stable networking protocol that helps the overall market.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of the news at hand, Bluetooth&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bluetooth.com\/news\/pressreleases\/2015\/11\/11\/bluetooth-technology-to-gain-longer-rangefaster-speedand-mesh-networking-in-2016\">announcements<\/a> were the most compelling. Their 2016 tech roadmap includes a 4 times longer range, mesh networking and double the speed without increasing power draw.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been slowly following the Bluetooth renaissance ever since the introduction of Bluetooth 4.0, also known as Bluetooth Low Energy. Bluetooth LE solved a lot of the annoying pairing issues and power problems associated with previous versions of Bluetooth. And for those reasons I saw it popping up in a lot of novel but compelling consumer IoT products like connected bike locks, where easy syncing with a smartphone was needed.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of the smart home, Bluetooth always had problems because it\u2019s range has been limited and it\u2019s not a mesh network, two requirements for a really robust smart home where data can seamlessly pass throughout the entire home. But that could all change in the future and the fact that Bluetooth chips are cheap and they are on everyone\u2019s smart phone translates into a very large install base.<\/p>\n<p>Thread\u2019s announcement heralded the opening of its program for device certification, in the same vein as Apple\u2019s HomeKit certification. Over <a href=\"http:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/home\/thread-launches-its-smart-home-product-certification-program\/\">30 products<\/a> and components have now been submitted to the consortium, which includes Samsung, Nest, Freescale, Silicon Labs, Qualcomm and others.<\/p>\n<p>The Thread protocol runs atop 6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low-power Wireless Personal Area Networks), and can work with existing 802.15.4 hardware wireless devices with a software update. 802.15.4 is the basis for ZigBee. One of the major reported advantages of Thread is that it\u2019s mesh network works well and that it\u2019s self healing. Imagine a home with 10 or 20 Thread enabled devices. If the battery dies on one, another communications point could be quickly found so that the flow of data continues. It\u2019s fair to say that in terms of developing and focusing on a mesh networking capability, Thread has been ahead of the competition and has truly been a protocol designed for consumer IoT.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s at stake for all of these players exists on two levels. On one level they want to preserve their position in the market. Freescale, for example, already offers a pre-certified software stack for Thread and is expecting full certification for its microcontrollers, microprocessors, sensors and communications options in the near future. If Thread gains traction, companies like Freescale want to be the go to vendors for pre certified components.<\/p>\n<p>But the second layer of what\u2019s at stake relates to the value of the overall market. In Bluetooth\u2019s press release Bluetooth\u2019s Toby Nixon made sure to reiterate that the IoT market potential could run as high as 11.1 trillion. I\u2019ve honestly never seen a projection that high, despite the huge buzz around IoT, but there\u2019s a different consideration here.<\/p>\n<p>If that very large market is ever to materialize, a secure, mesh networked, large install base protocol will need to emerge. Much of the value of consumer IoT in places like the smart home revolves around consumers having positive experiences with products that work well with other smart home products. Point application products, be they a thermostat or a smart lock, have incrementally more value in the market if they play well with other smart home devices.<\/p>\n<p>The first wave of successful smart home products have been point application products like the Sonos wireless speakers or the Nest thermostat. But the the future of the smart home will have to be bigger than that. It\u2019ll have to be about a context aware, integrated experience where developers are given the power to figure out creative applications that leverage the hardware resources across multiple home devices and multiple sensor systems.<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t believe that we currently actually even understand the full potential of the smart home because we haven\u2019t given developers a means to build apps atop all of the hardware in a home. And the sooner we settle on a robust protocol, the quicker we\u2019ll get to that smart home vision.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On the same day during the second week in November\u00a0both Bluetooth and Thread announced major updates and roadmaps for their respective network&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87621237,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359229460,359219674,359216856],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/941009"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87621237"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=941009"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/941009\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=941009"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=941009"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=941009"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":941005,"date":"2015-11-30T23:08:25","date_gmt":"2015-12-01T07:08:25","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/?p=248558"},"modified":"2015-11-30T23:08:25","modified_gmt":"2015-12-01T07:08:25","slug":"breaking-up-is-hard-to-do","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/30\/breaking-up-is-hard-to-do\/","title":{"rendered":"Breaking up is hard to do"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><em>Summary: Facebook is starting to address some of the complexities of fluid relationships in people&#8217;s lives. Many apps struggle with being the app for today, but not tomorrow, and users can&#8217;t be expected to do the hard work.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Facebook has <a href=\"http:\/\/newsroom.fb.com\/news\/2015\/11\/improving-the-experience-when-relationships-end\/\">recently introduced<\/a> a new feature allowing for users to take a break from their exes after a breakup. This is potentially very useful, and at the same time points up a challenge with many internet services, that they are resolutely for today and forward looking, and therefore tend to treat all relationships and linkages as if they are current.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook\u2019s idea is not completely new- Dodgeball faced the <a href=\"http:\/\/nymag.com\/nymetro\/nightlife\/sex\/columns\/mating\/11515\/\">same issue<\/a> in its development, especially important for a service which acted something like Tinder, in the emerging mobile world of New York and other urban areas in the mid-noughties. That service was notification based so it was easier to turn things off (though it presumably created \u201dbusted\u201d moments when someone who was clearly using the service was suddenly at the same bar as the ex, who had not received a notification of a nearby contact- Walter Scott said it early and best- \u201cOh, what a tangled web we weave, When first we practice to deceive!\u201d)<\/p>\n<p>The challenge for many of these services is that a link once made is assumed to be important and unchanging. A different and simple example of this is the challenge with services that link to Facebook for log in. My avatar for many services is the image I had on Facebook when I joined the third party service, using Facebook auth, but is not now the current Facebook avatar. This is amusing in some cases, annoying in others. <\/p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s too hard to manage- look at your phone<\/strong><br \/>\nContact lists on phones are another place where you\u2019ll likely see old avatars (I still have a 2012 election Facebook image as the contact photo for one of my more commonly phoned contacts). These phone contact lists are a great example of how technology has too long a memory and encourages brute force changes. Most phone contact lists are in essence random, with the numbers of some people you have only spoken with once enshrined for ever, because adding them to the contact list was the easiest thing to do that week. What phones need is something half way between the address book and the recently called list- perhaps with some sort of half life so you can have a manageable list you don\u2019t have to curate. Even with Plaxo, Linkedin and Brewster (and others), we are so far from functional contact lists that many people seem to have given up, and moved to (for example) Slack teams and Google Hangouts. They key point here is that they moved to a different app- rather than managing within an existing app.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Out with the old- in with the new!<\/strong><br \/>\nOne thing that Facebook is clearly trying to avoid is people taking a break from the service, or picking something else to avoid embarrassing or annoying interactions. It\u2019s often much easier to do something new than manage something old. The cognitive load of deciding who to delete from a contact list is somehow much higher than the delight of picking some of the same people for a new list (try it).<\/p>\n<p>Yahoo!\u2019s struggles are perhaps an example of what happens if a company relies on \u201cthe same thing\u201d for too long. No matter how good Yahoo! email gets, it is hard to think about going back to that first web mail account you opened to use it for real email, rather than the blunt spam management tool it has become for many. Google has managed to continually innovate with gmail, but likely it has remained the primary solution because it is no longer interesting to create another mass email solution- people have, for the moment, moved from email as an interesting new thing, and gmail was the last \u201ccool new version.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Facebook could be the same thing, after PlanetAll, TheGlobe, Friendster, and MySpace, is it perhaps not just that Facebook has won, but that the category is at some sort of local optimum, and really don\u2019t find it interesting enough to think about a direct replacement (instead we are now looking for the new new thing which likely provides some unforeseen capability, or leverages something in a unique way).<\/p>\n<p>Instant Messaging has gone through much of the same evolution, from consumer IM to Skype and then to SMS and mobile OTT solutions. Have we finished? Until it happens it\u2019s hard to know which app will be the last man standing winner.<\/p>\n<p>The world is fluid, and Facebook\u2019s \u201ctake a break\u201d feature is an interesting step, especially in a technology driven world where very often the normal way of doing something new is simply to pick a new tool.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Summary: Facebook is starting to address some of the complexities of fluid relationships in people&#8217;s lives.

But this reference was deliberate as emerging gift card solutions are empowering retailers to compete at the pre-paid card level. Which in turn enables retailers (many of whom already offer financial services) to become even more bank-like, but at lower cost and a more holistic view of the lifetime customer.<\/p>\n<p>In this last post, we will look at two of the companies contributing to this shake-up \u2013 an emerging start-up featured as one of the 2015 Money20\/20 Launchpad companies \u2013 Slide \u2013 and an established and rapidly growing alt fin services provider Cards.com.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Gift\/Pre-paid Cards Will Permanently Replace Some Bank Accounts. <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As previously discussed in this series, for Millennials and those entering the U.S. financial system for the first time, there is no really compelling reason to have a bank account. Even with rising interest rates, the return on holding your money in a bank is magnitudes lower than any number of alternative investment vehicles. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/millennials-ask-advisers-will-i-be-paying-student-loans-until-the-day-i-die-2015-12-15\">Particularly for younger consumers who have low\/no savings and high debt<\/a>, using financial services that are low cost in absolute terms \u2013 not relatively speaking \u2013are a priority. Dwolla and other low cost non-bank alternatives will likely see a spike in users in the coming years, particularly in the advent of a recession.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Slide: Gift Card Management for Consumers, A Platform for Retailers <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Into this environment where many can \u201ctake or leave\u201d the bank, there are increasingly viable, highly usable and even fun alternatives. Seed-funded <a href=\"http:\/\/www.getslide.com\">Slide<\/a> made its fintech industry debut at last year\u2019s Money 20\/20 conference, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/idUSnMKWLC504a+1f0+MKW20151020\">debuting at the show a suite of mobile gift card management<\/a> features that presents the consumer user with the ability to manage their gift cards all in a single wallet app. As compelling from the retailer\u2019s perspective, the company enables the consumer to buy \u2013 and reload \u2013 their gift cards in a theoretically infinite number of designs, adding a level of engagement with the brand not available on typical gift card sites, which tend to present brands in a mass market, commoditizing the value of the gift card itself and burying the brand in a sea of logos. The company\u2019s plans include adding the ability to instantly trade and transfer gift cards, placing the start-up in the realm of P2P payments.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s interesting about Slide are its initial users, who are not so much the typical tech early adopter, but who are more representative of the general population, such as mothers. According to Slide co-founder and CEO Mike Morris (formerly with American Express), \u201cSlide users come from pretty much every corner\/pocket across the country who share such common pain as managing their gift cards.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Retailers, some of whom have previously declined to have their gift cards sold online, are signing up with Slide. Morris observes that \u201cThe e-gift card industry is growing by 44% year-over-year, and merchants seem to be waking up to the fact that their gift card programs are generally underutilized and can be leveraged to engage and delight customers in new ways through digital experiences.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Card.com: Branchless Bank with $450 Million in Deposits \u2013 and Counting <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Last fall, <a href=\"http:\/\/card.com\/\">CARD.COM<\/a>\u00a0announced <a href=\"http:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/cardcom-announces-9-million-in-growth-funding-to-expand-mobile-technology-offering-and-generate-customer-growth-300180711.html\">$9 million in growth funding to expand its mobile tech offering<\/a> and to move from word of mouth to marketing-driven customer acquisition. With over $450 million in deposits to date, CARD.com has clearly made in-roads into its goal of becoming a leading non-bank financial institution.<\/p>\n<p>While CARD.com has no branches, 85% of their customers use their mobile app monthly, compared to the banking industry average of 30%. The remaining percentage use the service via the company\u2019s website. Significantly, as a SaaS (software-as-a-service), the company can scale up quickly to meet demand. Where it has run into some issues, and where it plans to invest significantly, is in the area of real-time customer service. New service introductions can also be introduced relatively quickly as compared to the banks, with CARD.com set to launch sub accounts (for spouses, teens, domestic helpers, etc.). Much like Slide, CARD.com is seeing significantly traction amongst moms. And compared to non-card focused branchless banks GreenDot and NetSpend, CARD.com reports that over 85% of their deposits are direct deposits of paychecks (as compared to a 30-40% range) \u2013 and their number of deposits is significantly larger, despite having only launched three years ago. As a point of comparison &#8212; the mobile banking sector today represents only 2 million accounts out of a total 14 million (inclusive of those doing mobile banking via branched banks) according to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.onlinebankingreport.com\/\">Digital Bank Report<\/a>. CARD.com in comparison has more than 600,000 accounts.<\/p>\n<p>The main driver behind this success? Customized cards and attention to serving the customer, even if that customer is unbanked. The service offers \u201cFair, Fashionable and Fun online prepaid card solutions\u201d and treats its customer \u201cas an individual who is cool like James Dean, sultry like Bettie Page or a cat-lover with a heart of gold.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.card.com\/\">CARD.com<\/a>\u00a0lets you represent the things you care about, with awesome perks along the way.\u201d Clearly not your average bank.<\/p>\n<p>Going into 2016, the remaining stigmas against gift cards will be further chipped away as the sector matures beyond paycheck deposits and retail goods. In <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pehub.com\/2015\/10\/stockpile-rakes-in-15-mln\/\">October 2015, Stockpile.com raised $15 million<\/a> in a Series A round from superstar VC Sequoia Capital and rockstar actor Ashton Kutcher, amongst others. The service will enables consumers to buy company stock via gift cards at retail locations, helping to democratize and demystify investments (not good news for the few remaining retail Wall Street brokers).<\/p>\n<p>Suffice it to say, gift cards are at the least hot.

It notes that Facebook&#8217;s is still seen as a test; that Twitter&#8217;s isn&#8217;t encountered very often even by its most fanatical users; and that Pinterest&#8217;s have led to fewer than 10 purchases a day from a retail partner.<\/p>\n<p>A Facebook spokesperson reiterated the company&#8217;s stance &#8212; that it&#8217;s testing its commerce tools, and that it&#8217;s focused on discovering new products as well as allowing people to purchase them with a &#8220;buy&#8221; button &#8212; in an interview. Twitter didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment. Pinterest emailed a prepared response:<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-since-launching-buya\"><p>Since launching Buyable Pins 6 months ago\u00a0we are encouraged by the early results for merchants. Although it&#8217;s still early days with the program we are hearing from merchants that many of their customers coming through Buyable Pins are new and we are driving\u00a0higher mobile conversions. We look forward to continuing to deliver value to our partners through the holiday season and a fun, easy shopping experience for our Pinners.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that criticism of these &#8220;buy&#8221; buttons doesn&#8217;t come amid a holiday shopping slump. Reports indicate\u00a0that Thanksgiving and Black Friday shopping habits were &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2015\/11\/30\/holiday-sales-perfectly-average-so-far-analyst.html\">perfectly average<\/a>,&#8221; and that an <a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/11\/28\/thanksgiving-online-sales\/#.fwdzfw:CKas\">estimated 34 percent<\/a> of purchases from\u00a0the last week were made by shoppers on their smartphones.<\/p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s not that people are closing their wallets this year, nor that they were too busy eating <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/25\/this-food-quality-startup-ruined-thanksgiving-by-analyzing-turkey-products\/\">potentially-worrisome\u00a0turkey products<\/a> to use their phones. They&#8217;re spending a fair amount and they&#8217;re doing so via their smartphones &#8212; they just don&#8217;t seem to be using\u00a0social networking companies&#8217;\u00a0purchasing\u00a0tools to do so.<\/p>\n<p>This might not be too problematic for Facebook and Twitter. Both companies have introduced\u00a0features unrelated to commerce &#8212; like a <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/08\/26\/facebook-announces-a-new-digital-assistant-m\/\">not-so-virtual assistant<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/10\/06\/are-you-not-entertained\/\">summaries of breaking news<\/a> &#8212; over the last few months. But Pinterest&#8217;s inability to convert digital window shoppers into buyers could be a problem.<\/p>\n<p>Commerce has been Pinterest&#8217;s focus for a while. First came <a href=\"https:\/\/business.pinterest.com\/en\/buyable-pins\">the buyable pins<\/a>; then came <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/03\/pinterest-introduces-a-dedicated-shop-to-open-users-wallets\/\">a dedicated shopping section<\/a> in its mobile apps; and then came <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/09\/pinterest-introduces-a-new-visual-search-tool\/\">a new visual search tool<\/a> designed to allow people to identify products shown in pins. It&#8217;s obvious that the company wants people to buy things found on its service.<\/p>\n<p>That\u00a0makes Recode&#8217;s report more damning. A Pinterest spokesperson offered several examples of businesses finding new customers through its service &#8212; the same as they do on Facebook and Twitter &#8212; but only one of a brand improving sales by a notable margin. And even that was expressed as a percentage of growth instead of an absolute value, which makes it hard to tell how big a bump that really was.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The effectiveness of buy buttons hans\u2019t been fully realized at this early stage. Mobile users have many options for making purchases and it will take time for this payment route have an impact on overall mobile e-commerce sales,&#8221; Gartner analyst Brian Blau told Gigaom. &#8220;I think we will see [these companies]\u00a0make adjustments and continue to configure these purchase points over the coming year to optimize their role in the mobile customer purchase funnel.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s still early in this game. All of these companies have emphasized that their commerce efforts are being tested, and at least for Facebook and Twitter, it&#8217;s clear that the companies aren&#8217;t focusing all of their efforts on getting people to buy things through their platforms. Those companies will be fine either way.<\/p>\n<p>Pinterest&#8217;s success or failure in this regard will be more interesting. The service is often used as a way for people to learn about new products. (Or, as it seems to be used in my house, as a never-ending source of hit-or-miss recipes.) Now it just has to bridge the gap between\u00a0discovering a product and purchasing it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Social networking companies have made no secret of their desire to convince people to purchase things discovered in ads, photos, and other&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611561,"featured_media":920828,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[18976876,359218214,359228531,359221038],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920826"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611561"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920826"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920826\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920828"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920826"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920826"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920826"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920814,"date":"2015-11-30T12:03:53","date_gmt":"2015-11-30T20:03:53","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920814"},"modified":"2015-11-30T12:03:53","modified_gmt":"2015-11-30T20:03:53","slug":"facing-threat-of-extinction-how-pro-services-can-compete-in-the-age-of-ai","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/30\/facing-threat-of-extinction-how-pro-services-can-compete-in-the-age-of-ai\/","title":{"rendered":"Facing threat of extinction: How pro services can compete in the age of AI"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><em>Alastair is president at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.huddle.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Huddle<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The professional service industry &#8212; any third-party consultancy or support service that helps businesses operate better &#8212; is massive. In the United States the professional service industry is comprised of almost 20 million people, which is roughly 13 percent of the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bls.gov\/cps\/cpsaat08.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">total American workforce.<\/a>\u00a0Those 13 percent are in grave danger,\u00a0finding themselves jobless in as little as 10 years.<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bls.gov\/news.release\/empsit.nr0.htm\" target=\"_blank\">latest job reports<\/a>\u00a0from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that the American services industry is currently thriving, but starting to come under extreme threat. Burgeoning new markets overseas, which used to support industrial economies, are transitioning into service-based economies. That flood of new (oftentimes extremely inexpensive) labor means incredible new competition for almost every aspect of the service industry, including professionals like lawyers and paralegals, accountants,\u00a0and\u00a0business consultants.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, businesses and pro\u00a0service professionals around the world face an even greater common threat: replacement. The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automation mean that professional service businesses don\u2019t only have to worry about human competitors; they have to worry about machines as well. Today, algorithms help people solve their business problems. Software like QuickBooks and Xero attract customers who\u00a0third-party accountants used to own exclusively, without anyone (or rather, anything) to contest them.\u00a0 And\u00a0there is a program in the works\u00a0that can <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slate.com\/articles\/technology\/robot_invasion\/2011\/09\/will_robots_steal_your_job_5.html\" target=\"_blank\">instantly analyze the legitimacy of a legal claim<\/a>. You can already see the impact of automation at work in other industries like administration and executive assistance, for example,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/x.ai\/\" target=\"_blank\">x.ai\u2019s<\/a>\u00a0says that its product \u2014 a robotic assistant called Amy \u2014 can fully replace a real human aid.<\/p>\n<p>The professional services sector will face an onslaught of new competition, and when it does, service-based businesses need to be able to set themselves apart and prove their value \u2013 or die trying.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"the-calm-before-the-storm\">The calm before the storm<\/h4>\n<p>To get an idea of how quickly the professional service businesses can shift from complacency into chaos, look no further than the disintegrating world of European tax audit firms. In 2014, in the wake of a series of public fraud claims, the European Union instituted\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.wsj.com\/cfo\/2014\/04\/03\/european-parliament-approves-mandatory-auditor-rotation\/\">a mandatory audit firm rotation rule<\/a>, which mandated that all European companies switch to a different firm every ten years. Instead of doubling down to compete on the quality of their products and services, audit firms have responded by lowering their fees. This has created an environment where competition is based on price, not quality of work. The\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.accountingtoday.com\/news\/auditing\/audit-firm-rotation-leading-to-lower-audit-fees-in-europe-72945-1.html\">results<\/a>\u00a0have been ugly, and it is only a matter of time before new competition from overseas and technology swoops in that can win on price, maybe even quality.<\/p>\n<p>That experience of sudden, constant competition isn\u2019t something that will stay limited to auditors. As technology advances and the world shifts, every professional services business will be put under the microscope by its clients and forced to distinguish itself. Unfortunately, the fields where differentiation is most critical can also be the ones that are hardest to showcase. Often there aren\u2019t metrics to point to, and firms can\u2019t compete with algorithms in terms on price.<\/p>\n<p>To be truly successful in the new marketplace, businesses need to find new ways to set their services apart to save themselves.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"keeping-the-services-industry-\">Keeping the services industry relevant with new rules<\/h4>\n<p>One of the biggest value-adds that any professional service can offer is its knowledge\u2014industry expertise, experience and understanding of your clients themselves are hugely important, and aren\u2019t something that other players can easily replicate. That said,\u00a0knowledge at firms can easily become siloed if resources are limited. Even the smallest companies these days often need to operate globally, so having access to knowledge from all over the world is also a massive asset, lending firms provide extremely valuable insight that competitive alternatives might lack. One way to diversify knowledge is to alter corporate structure; for example,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.accountancyage.com\/aa\/news\/2406954\/grant-thornton-partners-vote-to-boldly-become-shared-enterprise-firm\">Grant Thorton UK moved to a shared enterprise format<\/a>\u00a0to give voice to all of its employees. Firms should also take a closer look at software to engage and interact with remote teams and leverage their expertise as well, without relying on workflow-slowing email back-and-forth.<\/p>\n<p>Another way professional services firms can distinguish themselves is to highlight their creativity.\u00a0Creative contributions can\u2019t be outsourced, automated or devalued. A company\u2019s creativity will always be a powerful leveraging point with clients. Finding the creative areas where a firm\u2019s creativity flourishes and how to showcase that creativity can be a huge boon. For example, this might mean hiring diversely, providing creative resources, or even acquiring a whole new company,\u00a0like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pwc.com\/us\/en\/press-releases\/2014\/pwc-completes-its-acquisition-of-booz-and-company.html\">PricewaterhouseCoopers<\/a> did last year<a href=\"http:\/\/www.pwc.com\/us\/en\/press-releases\/2014\/pwc-completes-its-acquisition-of-booz-and-company.html\">.<\/a>\u00a0Creativity is one of the few assets that is completely irreplaceable, and therefore priceless.<\/p>\n<p>Most importantly, service-based companies must learn to dissolve the wall between themselves and their clients.\u00a0Good service experiences ultimately boil down to relationships\u2014they\u2019re what make or break any new client engagement. The single most important factor for developing those relationships is communication and transparency. By opening channels of communication through consistent collaboration, firms can break down the barrier between themselves and their client, becoming less of a commoditized service provider and more of a trusted partner.<\/p>\n<p>Businesses today are deeply concerned with maintaining accountability (and with good reason, as illustrated by the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.accountingtoday.com\/news\/auditing\/audit-firm-rotation-leading-to-lower-audit-fees-in-europe-72945-1.html\">fraud behind the European rotation<\/a>). If companies can offer clients clear insight into what you\u2019re working on, you can win their confidence and retain their business. Some companies grow closer with their clients by working on projects in conjunction. Others partner on new initiatives or share joint resources. Whatever a company can do to bring themselves closer to their client is a step closer to becoming indispensable to them.<\/p>\n<p>When business is going well, it\u2019s easy to sit back and be complacent. But truly successful organizations are constantly evolving, with an eye to how things might change in the future. Professional services are incredibly nuanced. They add indispensable value. And the more they can clearly demonstrate this, the more they\u2019ll thrive &#8212; even in the face of a more competitive environment.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Alastair is president at Huddle.

Handset makers working with carriers to optimize coverage is nothing new but the focus of those tests does tell us about the significant challenge (and opportunity) available to the carriers as the number of connected devices grows.<\/p>\n<p>The initial test will take place over the 900MHz spectrum, which is reserved in Europe for 2G and 3G cellular carriers. The goal is to improve coverage, so that harder to reach indoor spaces are connected as well as remote locations. Think everything from the smart home to that drilling rig out in a field.<\/p>\n<p>The other tests related to extending battery life and reducing costs by deploying a single antenna modem that has much lower memory requirements as well as a very small power envelope. The tested modems are being made by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sequans.com\/\">Sequans<\/a>. Sequans is focused on building low cost and low power LTE chipsets for IoT.<\/p>\n<p>These tests tell the story of both ends of the market in IoT. On the one hand, carriers need to figure out a way to reduce LTE power draw as well as hardware costs. On the other end, the carriers have to find a way to extend coverage for low bandwidth applications running on 2G and 3G networks.<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0challenges facing the carriers boil down to core questions about how they will provide affordable connectivity at low power and excellent coverage all the while being cognizant of the concerns that there simply may not be enough spectrum to deliver all of the data the market wants delivered. Simple sensors in a field running over 2G or 3G are one thing. Needing multiple streaming video feeds from a remote location is another.<\/p>\n<p>Figuring out the perfect network technology that will keep costs down while delivering reliable, low power connectivity remains a core focus of the carriers.<\/p>\n<p>To this end, Orange has chosen <a href=\"http:\/\/www.machinetomachinemagazine.com\/2015\/09\/22\/orange-deploys-network-for-internet-of-things-iot\/\">to invest in<\/a> a new Low Power Wide Area1 (LPWA) network, which uses LoRa (Long Range) technology. LoRa competes against SIGFOX technology, which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rudebaguette.com\/2015\/02\/11\/sigfox-raises-e100-million-telefonica-gdf-suez-ntt-docomo\/\">picked up a healthy 100 million Euros<\/a> in investment earlier this year from the likes of Telefonica, SK Telekom and others. Orange believes IoT can help it generate 600 million Euros by 2018 for that business unit by itself.<\/p>\n<p>LPWA is a narrow band network that has been designed to consume less energy. Specifically, Orange believes that this type of network is ideal for small connected objects that are not wired and also do not need constant, streaming communication. Rather this type of network is for objects that can emit sporadic, non critical data.<\/p>\n<p>Target markets that spring to mind are sensors in the smart home as well as smart city applications like municipal lighting. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cepro.com\/article\/french_telecom_giant_orange_launches_10_month_diy_home_automation_package\/\">Orange has its own smart<\/a> home products and has joined many other carriers in the belief that the smart home represents an opportunity to leverage its cell networks to sell customers additional services.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s interesting for the carriers is that really two markets are emerging and figuring out how to profit in each has different constraints. Yes, bringing down the cost of LTE connectivity and hardware as well as ushering in 5G will be critical to the high bandwidth end of the market. But there\u2019s also the lower bandwidth part of the market for everything from connected parking meters to wearables to soil sensors on a farm.<\/p>\n<p>Figuring out the right mix of network technologies at the right price and the right power envelope is the challenge for the carriers going forward. Because one thing\u2019s for sure: the entire IoT market depends on them being able to do so, and do so at massive scale.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last week Ericsson announced that it was working with Orange Telecom to test three networks.

A super fun and well imagined scenario, which set up 30 minute delivery as meeting an urgent need, rather than a specific tight window (so very much slotting into &#8220;on demand&#8221; rather than &#8220;scheduled&#8221; delivery).<\/p>\n<p>This was very much not a sensor based shopping experience, but focused instead on simply the delivery component. One small tweak that will make this more plausible going forward is Amazon (and others, but who?) knowing everything you have bought, so instead of having to specify the brand and size of shoes needed, you will simply re-buy something you have already bought. It&#8217;s remarkably hard to execute this in the world today- products are not actually self-selling-  so to know exactly what something is, and how to re-buy it, has not a design requirement. Bar or QR codes and NFC tags on or in products might help, but we are a long way from that today. This is especially important in things like soccer boots and guitar strings (another very plausible &#8220;I need it right now&#8221; situation, and one where exact specifications are important, but not obvious from the product itself), but also awkward when products are sold with micro variations (toothpaste is an easy example- peppermint or spearmint, paste or gel?). As we flagged last week IoT and sensor-based shopping will change how goods are sold, and this simple repurchase is another different example of the same thing.<\/p>\n<p>Is drone delivery another nail in the retail coffin? Likely not, especially for higher end retail. For stores that are in essence mini-warehouses in second tier (cheap) locations it will become harder and harder to compete, but for others drone delivery might be the perfect complement to the &#8220;shopping as experience&#8221; strategy. If a consumer can select a product and then relax in the high end mall coffee shop for 29 minutes knowing (and perhaps even watching) their product will be delivered, for many that might be better than any home delivery. Certainly a drone strategy which requires flight path approvals at any level at all, and guarantee of a reasonable landing area (dealing with slopes, trees, snow will be complicated), might find it simpler to deliver to a known spot (on the roof of a building, or in a secure, known landing area), rather than assuming the ability to land in any garden.<\/p>\n<p>Will drone delivery be commonplace? Drones do not obviously beat self-driving cars in many situations, especially in scenarios that envision most cars being self driving (and we hope road congestion being much reduced). Autonomous street vehicles have much to prove in how they handling weather, but they will certainly beat drones, except in floods. Where drones do clearly win is in flexibility of last few yard deliveries (just over the garden fence\/on the roof etc) and also in the ability to deal with the center of cities, as long as the airways remain open them. So clearly a role for drones, but most likely as part of a broader suite of solutions.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Following on from last week&#8217;s post on the logistics around what an IoT driven home shopping experience might require, it was interesting&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87877999,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/941011"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87877999"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=941011"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/941011\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=941011"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=941011"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=941011"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":940978,"date":"2015-11-29T12:16:20","date_gmt":"2015-11-29T20:16:20","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/?p=248647"},"modified":"2015-11-29T12:16:20","modified_gmt":"2015-11-29T20:16:20","slug":"the-gift-card-sector-comes-of-age-part-4-of-5-sector-outlook-gift-cards-as-alternative-banking","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/29\/the-gift-card-sector-comes-of-age-part-4-of-5-sector-outlook-gift-cards-as-alternative-banking\/","title":{"rendered":"The Gift Card Sector Comes of Age.

In this post we will further examine one of these drivers \u2013 the bundling of bank-like services into the pre-paid card relationship as an emerging consumer financial paradigm. This courting of the un-banked and under-banked by retailers and other non-bank entities represents an arguably permanent shift away from the traditional retail bank as consumers\u2019 primary financial resource.<\/p>\n<p>In the past, the \u201cun-banked\u201d and \u201cunderbanked\u201d have referred to new country arrivals and those otherwise disadvantaged in the U.S. financial system \u2013 minors too young to have a checking account, young adults with no credit history, people unable to maintain the minimum balance requirements for a checking account, and so on. People alternatively have <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gatesfoundation.org\/What-We-Do\/Global-Development\/Financial-Services-for-the-Poor\">treated this issue as a problem for charity<\/a>, or as a way to take further advantage of a group with few financial choices (i.e. predatory financial services &#8212; payday lenders and other consumer \u201csubprime\u201d credit providers with double-digit interest rates, low limits and high fees). But as bank fees rise (without the needed longer bank branch hours and other services\/features needed by many people \u2013 underbanked or no), alternative banking is becoming a smart choice for the informed consumer across demographic and economic segments.<\/p>\n<p>In this environment of disillusionment with the banking system (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.philadelphiafed.org\/community-development\/publications\/cascade\/84\/04_why-do-the-unbanked-use-alternative-financial-services\">alt financial services users say that there are issues with the lack of \u201cservice,\u201d \u201ctrust,\u201d and \u201crespect\u201d<\/a> from traditional institutions), more people are turning to alternative financial service products \u2013 and the market for these services is growing. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.philadelphiafed.org\/community-development\/publications\/cascade\/84\/04_why-do-the-unbanked-use-alternative-financial-services\">A 2011 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) survey revealed that 25% of all U.S. households used an alternative financial product between June 2010 and June 2011. The study also found that non-bank transaction services (i.e. non-bank money orders, check cashing and remittances), were used by 39% of U.S. households. <\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/csd.wustl.edu\/Publications\/Documents\/RB15-57.pdf\">Fast forward to 2015, and the percentage of alternative financial service users amongst the low and middle classes has grown to 39%. <\/a> While new payment models have been introduced to serve the <em>involuntarily<\/em> underbanked, companies like <a href=\"http:\/\/paynearme.com\/en\/\">PayNearMe<\/a>, which enables users to pay for goods and services online and in-store with a card backed by cash paid to a physical outlet \u2013 have experienced issues with a fractured market for its services as well as logistical, even store security issues when dealing with larger cash transactions. As such, those solutions that court consumers who are <em>voluntarily<\/em> opting out of the bank and credit card system \u2013 such as bitcoin and other cryptocurrency exchange services and emerging high-service, high usability gift and other pre-paid card products are gaining ground as they begin to capture multiple segments of the diverse un\u2014and under-banked market.<\/p>\n<p>Interestingly as banks move towards pushing the consumer into a self-serve model via ATM\u2019s, email inquiries and fees for in-bank visits, pre-paid card issuers are increasing the levels of service that have traditionally been out of reach to the under-banked and other users of pre-paid value vehicles. As such, being a pre-paid cardholder \u2013 particularly at the platinum levels \u2013 is an attractive alt fin consumer choice. At the least, pre-paid cards can be seen as a way to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/02\/08\/your-money\/credit-and-debit-cards\/prepaid-debit-cards-may-augment-bank-accounts.html?_r=0\">augment a bank account<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Millennials: The First Wave for Alt Finance<\/p>\n<p>More importantly, choosing to be un-banked is now a viable financial lifestyle choice. Whether as a result of people\u2019s disillusionment with traditional banks, a desire to share less personal information with institutions, or because XXX, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/finance\/banking\/reasons-unbanked-underbanked-1.aspx\">people who are able to participate in the larger banked population are choosing to instead to become at least partially unbanked<\/a>, with their financial assets divided across multiple financial accounts. As significant, some users are skipping the banks altogether for more lucrative products like loans and going directly to alt finance specialty services such as SoFi, a lender focused on the millennial market.<\/p>\n<p>Increasingly post-Millennials are choosing to eschew traditional banks altogether with the rise of alternatives such as Robinhood. And while the Millennials do have bank accounts with the majors, their money and perhaps more importantly, their transactions, are split amongst several institutions &#8212; as a hedge against another financial crisis, if unconsciously. While Millennials need \u2013 and value \u2013 financial advisement as much as other segments, they are getting their information from like-minded peer sources versus a bank expert \u2013 and they are likely to get their advice from multiple sources as well.<\/p>\n<p>But several trends indicate that the ranks of the underbanked are growing as the un-banked and underbanked are presented with ever more &#8220;banking-like&#8221; options and with the emergence of innovative new offerings that provide consumers with options that the banks have been slow to offer, or which have previously only been available to those with stellar credit and\/or large deposit accounts. In comparison with fee-laden bank accounts, pre-paid cards are highly attractive. American Express offers:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>No credit check<\/li>\n<li>No minimum balance<\/li>\n<li>No hidden fees<\/li>\n<li>Value-add services such as online bill pay, tools to manage your money<\/li>\n<li>Cash-back on premier tier (with minimum loads)<\/li>\n<li>Free direct deposit<\/li>\n<li>Large scale cash re-load networks (45,000+) and ATM access<\/li>\n<li>Subaccounts<\/li>\n<li>Mobile capabilities<\/li>\n<li>Connected to your checking\/savings account<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In addition, the American Express-Walmart Bluebird offers:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dedicated customer service<\/li>\n<li>Check-writing<\/li>\n<li>Transfer funds between Bluebird and checking\/savings accounts<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/features\/2015-how-amex-lost-costco\/\">While the pre-paid business currently represents a relatively small 2%<\/a> of the business, it may figure importantly as American Express struggles to keep its high net worth customers, and in the wake of such losses at the Costco co-brand account. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/business\/personal-finance\/amex-adds-cash-back-prepaid-debit-card-bid-new-customers-n412346\">The pre-paid business is experiencing triple year-over-year growth as a result of these attractive features, though in the scope of AmEx\u2019s overall business, pre-paid is not contributing significantl<\/a>y to the company\u2019s profitablity.<\/p>\n<p>But that\u2019s not the point. AmEx is developing consumer relationships &#8212; building brand, goodwill and a customer pipeline for higher margin products. In this manner, American Express is able to tap into consumer segments that had previously been unable to them, and to potentially retain the customer relationship if and when a pre-paid card user is able to, or decides to become banked.<\/p>\n<p>In the final part of this five-part series on gift cards, we will look at two companies in particular \u2013 one a recently launched start-up and the other an established and fast-growing force in the pre-paid cards business \u2013 that are focusing on usability and merchant\/brand relationships to capitalize on the rising use of stored value cards as non-bank financial account vehicles.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In part 3 of this gift card series, we looked at the business drivers behind increased consumer adoption.

A two-sided market:<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-i-predict-that-over-13\" ><p>I predict that, over time, the Windows laptop market, which has long clustered in the $400-700 range, will gradually fragment into very low-end and very high-end segments &#8212; the former to take on Google and the latter to take on Apple. I expect the middle to thin out, as customers on a budget go for the cheaper models and those who want and can afford the latest and greatest go higher.<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft, eager to push Windows 10 and presumably concerned about Chromebooks, also appears to be giving companies like Lenovo a hand with deals like the free year of Office with hefty cloud storage. Lenovo wasn&#8217;t the first big PC maker to sell a Chromebook-priced Windows PC. HP last year started selling a $200 Windows laptop with an 11.6&#8243; screen called the Stream. Asus has one, too.<\/p>\n<p>While the Lenovo is the only non-refurbished Windows laptop I could find on the Best Buy website for $150 or less, there&#8217;s reason to think that more and more PC laptops will find their way into Chromebook price territory, typically $295 or under. That&#8217;s mainly because Microsoft is on a core corporate mission to convert the masses to Windows 10. And its hardware partners, who have been struggling for years, need good relations with the software giant to sell more of the machines they really want to push: the $1,000 class of laptops long dominated by their common adversary, Apple.<\/p>\n<p>Also, let&#8217;s face it: the basic PC laptop, the one that doesn&#8217;t try to act as a tablet as well, has become commoditized. And Windows 10 can run acceptably on a surprisingly wide range of hardware.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The deeper trend may be toward zero-cost laptop, where Microsoft may decide that underwriting the hardware and software for a laptop is worth it if someone signs up for a few years of Office, or some other web service (Adobe?

This part 3 of the series takes a more in-depth look at how consumer sentiment is changing \u2013 and why.<\/p>\n<p>In the United States, consumers loaded more than $64 billion USD onto general purpose reloadable prepaid cards in 2012, according to the Mercator Advisory Group, up from $56.8 billion in 2011. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mercatoradvisorygroup.com\/Reports\/12th-Annual-U_S_-Prepaid-Cards-Market-Forecasts_-2015%E2%80%932018\/\">firm\u2019s latest Dec. 2015 pre-paid market forecast<\/a> estimates that the larger segment of closed loop cards (i.e. specialty store pre-load cards such as Starbuck\u2019s where consumers are limited to using the card at a particular chain\/brand) will grow 3% to reach $371 billion by 2018 while open loop card (i.e. Visa, Mastercard branded cards that can be used anywhere that takes credit cards) loads will grow 7% &#8212; to $343 billion \u2013 in the same period.<\/p>\n<p>What is important to note here is that the stigma \u2013 both amongst consumers and within the financial services community \u2013 attached to the pre-paid card is as strong as ever. But the factors driving gift card adoption by consumers are business-driven changes that include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Gentrification of the Pre-paid Customer Experience <\/em><\/strong><br \/>\nThe branding of pre-paid cards with aspirational messages and providing value-add services to debit cardholders position the use of the stored value card on par with services available to banked consumers with credit cards and checking accounts. By providing the pre-paid consumer with access to core services and in general treating this group with respect, the ranks of pre-paid customers are expanding.<\/li>\n<li><strong><em>Personalization of the Gift Card<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>The emerging ability to highly customize pre-paid cards at all load amount levels \u2013 that is, you can personalize your gift and personal payment experiences with custom designs for card demoninations as small as $5 USD. By involving the consumer in the gift card design process, companies like Cards.com are engaging with the consumer in a personalized way that creates loyalty and attaches an element of entertainment and gamification (i.e. collect cards with different designs) to the normally routine gift card purchase\/payment method selection process.Also significant is that this repackaging of pre-paid value into a desirable form factor allows the consumer to express themselves via the payment vehicle in facile manner\u2013 something that you can\u2019t do \u2013 or at least as easily and quickly &#8212; with other payment forms.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Diversification of choice in the Gift Card Retail Experience<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>Corresponding to the trend to personalize the gift card design itself is the growing awareness by some retailers that gift card design does matter to consumers and that in fact, the design of the card can be a mechanism for engagement with the customer. The choices of design offered to consumers under a particular brand \u2013 or lack of choice and good design options \u2013 can notably affect the way a brand is perceived. As important, offering customers multiple choices in gift card design allows for fluidity in the communication of the brand in contrast to the typical cookie-cutter physical store environment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Digitization of gift cards<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong>The increasing affordability and ubiquity of smart phones for mobile commerce and the cache` and convenience of transacting via one\u2019s mobile device has given the gift card sector new life as emerging tools from companies such as Slide now enable people to load e-gift cards or to convert the physical gift cards in their wallets into e-gift cards that can be managed all in one app. This paves the way for transferring e-gift cards directly between individuals in a P2P marketplace.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.raise.com\/blog\/sell-egift-cards\/\">Raise also allows you to convert your physical gift card into an e-gift card<\/a> by typing in the card information. In general, electronic transfer of e-gift cards allows for the faster exchange of value (versus mailing plastic cards or printing out e-gift card certificates), and also allows for such valuable features as instant balance verifications for the buyer purchasing a card from an exchange.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Somes case studies and developments to consider:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Starbucks offers a variety of physical gift cards for consumers to choose from, with minimal loads of just $5. The card design selections changed frequently based on the season and also provide location-specific design options \u2013 featuring the Golden Gate Bridge for gift cards sold in San Francisco locations, for example.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Start-up <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getslide.com\/\">Slide<\/a> Network has already inked deals with major retailers such as Best Buy to represent their brands via a highly usable e-gift card app in which consumers can engage with the brand and choose from a variety of e-gift card designs. Electronic account storage allows the company to show you the balance outstanding on your uploaded gift cards, with a forthcoming feature enabling the transfer of e-gift cards to friends and family instantly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>American Express\u2019 Serve pre-paid card line and its Bluebird card partnership with Wal-mart provide consumers with a hybrid offering that combines some of the services available to banking customers \u2013 such as check writing &#8212; with traditional (and even premium) charge card holder benefits like cash-back on your purchases. With features including no credit check to open an account, and no minimum balances required, AmEx\u2019s offering provides an attractive product for the unbanked, under-banked, disillusioned millennial and generally cash-strapped consumer alike.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In part 4 of this 5 part gift card series, we will take a closer look at the pre-paid debit card as an alternative to traditional retail banking.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In part 2 of this look at the gift card sector, we examined some of the business, technology and consumer behavior trends&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87725674,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/940981"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87725674"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=940981"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/940981\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=940981"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=940981"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=940981"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":940984,"date":"2015-11-26T19:40:39","date_gmt":"2015-11-27T03:40:39","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/?p=248625"},"modified":"2015-11-26T19:40:39","modified_gmt":"2015-11-27T03:40:39","slug":"248625","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/26\/248625\/","title":{"rendered":"The Gift Card Sector Comes of Age.

This season\u2019s unprecedented boycott of in-store Black Friday by some major retailers like REI and consumers\u2019 growing weariness with, and wariness of the physical retail store experience this year reached an inflection point, morphing from mere disenchantment to angry action, with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/boycottblackthursday\">growing support for the consumer boycotting of Black Friday<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than abandoning the retailers, consumers continued to engage with their favored brands online, with REI experiencing a 10-26% rise in online sales during the Thanksgiving holiday, according to digital analytics company <a href=\"http:\/\/www.geekwire.com\/2015\/reis-move-to-close-black-friday-pays-off-in-more-online-traffic\/\">SimilarWeb. Other retailers saw even more dramatic increases in online sales, with GameStop and Staples experiencing a one-day rise of 120%+, PetSmart a rise of 69% and Nordstrom and Pier1 both reporting a 54% one-day rise in web traffic<\/a>. Overall, <a href=\"http:\/\/bizbeatblog.dallasnews.com\/2015\/11\/black-friday-store-sales-drop-off-by-more-than-1-billion-as-shopping-habits-change.html\/\">Black Friday in-store sales dropped by more than $1 billion<\/a> \u2013 or 10% from previous year holiday sales while online sales increased. In fact, a <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/12\/24\/retail-commerce-holiday-malls\/\">National Retail Federation (NRF) survey<\/a> found that indeed more people shopped online (103 million) than at the store (102 million) during the Thanksgiving\/Black Friday period.<\/p>\n<p>Gift cards are playing a part in this migration online, with consumer attitudes about gift cards changing as the sector provides more value-added features that increase the level of both physical and e-gift card personalization available to consumers, and that provide the convenience of allowing users to add value, store and transact with the cards anytime, anywhere. Moreover, marketplaces like Raise, Cardpool and Giftcards.com are enabling people to buy gift cards online for a discount, making gift cards even more appealing in some cases than the purchase of a discounted physical good as you could theoretically double dip \u2013 use the full value of a discounted card to buy a wanted item when it goes on sale.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, in both the U.S. and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newswire.ca\/news-releases\/popularity-of-gift-cards-grows-in-canada-560925471.html\">Canada, e-gift cards are not only viewed as acceptable, but increasingly as the preferred way to show gift appreciation<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In the next Part Three of this series about the gift card sector, we\u2019ll look at how the growth of gift card business model and technology innovation is not just about the convenience of the pre-paid card, but about a larger trend towards the de-centralization of consumer finances, driven by such factors as millennial distrust of the bank as the sole institution for housing one\u2019s money, and the broadening ranks of the under-banked.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In Part One of our look at the gift card sector, we provided an overview of the accelerated activity characterizing the sector&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87725674,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359217219,359235113,461797,298793,63860,213427,359235096,13879],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/940984"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87725674"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=940984"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/940984\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=940984"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=940984"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=940984"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":940985,"date":"2015-11-25T19:33:14","date_gmt":"2015-11-26T03:33:14","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/?p=248624"},"modified":"2015-11-25T19:33:14","modified_gmt":"2015-11-26T03:33:14","slug":"the-gift-card-sector-comes-of-age-series-part-1-of-5-gift-cards-are-cool-again-and-everyone-wants-in","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/25\/the-gift-card-sector-comes-of-age-series-part-1-of-5-gift-cards-are-cool-again-and-everyone-wants-in\/","title":{"rendered":"The Gift Card Sector Comes of Age (Series). Part 1 of 5: Gift Cards are Cool Again (and Everyone Wants In)"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>The gift card sector is sizzling these days \u2013 more so than they\u2019ve ever been. In the past four years, there has been a significant uptick in new technology and new business models in the sector. The new entrants have reached critical mass such that this year\u2019s Money2020 conference organizers selected an e-gift card start-up &#8212; Slide \u2013 to be amongst its featured Launchpad 360 companies, and chose to include in this year\u2019s agenda several sessions on the topic of gift and pre-paid cards, with one session proclaiming that The Gift Card Is Cool Again.<\/p>\n<p>But the real indicator that there is real opportunity in the sector is that there is diverse and large-scale investment being put into the e-gift card sector. While obvious that MasterCard would include companies like Slide in its incubator program, celebrities such as Mary Hart (a Yiftee investor), national retailers, small fintech funds as well as top tier VC&#8217;s like Bessemer Venture Partners are identifying both market need and product fit within the sector.<\/p>\n<p>Companies such as Loop Commerce (not to be confused with mobile wallet\/POS company LoopPay) garnered a $16 million series B round in April 2015 to build out its e-gift card business, and more recently, Cards.com scored a $9 million growth capital facility this past November to expand services surrounding its custom e-gift card business. And gift card marketplace Raise is using the $56 million Series B round the company secured in January of this year to expand aggressively &#8212; growing from four employees working out of a small apartment in 2013 to a 200+ workforce housed in a 50,000 square foot space in Chicago\u2019s Loop business district. On a smaller scale, hyper-local e-gift provider Yiftee has carved out its own market niche, raising over $3 million since its founding in 2011.<\/p>\n<p>Gift card companies are also being acquired by some of the fintech industry\u2019s most formidable players, with First Data Corporation buying bitcoin-based Gyft in July of 2014, less than a year after the start-up\u2019s $5 million series A round. One year later, First Data continued its mission of building the \u201cindustry\u2019s most integrated, complete and comprehensive prepaid gift card solution at scale\u201d via its acquisition of Transaction Wireless, a digital gift card distribution and marketing platform.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, established gift card infrastructure companies are growing and consolidating. Similar in rationale to eBay\u2019s separation from PayPal, Safeway (yes the grocery chain) spun off its fast-growing gift card division Blackhawk Networks in April 2014. A year earlier in April 2013, the wholly-owned subsidiary had raised $230 million, for a market value of $1.2 billion. Significantly, the sale was led by Tier One banks Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank. Eight months post-IPO, Blackhawk purchased European gift card startup Retailo, deepening its international reach (20 countries) and continuing to diversify outside the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>So why is the gift card sector taking off now? There is a confluence of factors that are contributing to the rise of the e-gift card. The most important is the advent of mobile. While no single mobile wallet has taken off across all consumer demographics, the plethora of offerings and accompanying marketing drives have contributed to a consumer belief that transacting via one\u2019s mobile device is reasonably safe and a viable way to pay (as opposed to using cash or a card). Add to that the willingness of consumers to trade electronic security and their personal information (PII) for the convenience of mobile and you have a situation where the loading of gift card value onto one\u2019s phone is a better way to manage these pre-paid assets. We\u2019ll take a look at mobility and the other social, business and technology trends that are making pre-paid value cards relevant and valuable to both consumers and businesses in part two of this five part series.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The gift card sector is sizzling these days \u2013 more so than they\u2019ve ever been.

Well, mostly silent anyway. Yesterday, Apple <a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/11\/24\/apple-faceshift\/\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed<\/a> to TechCrunch that it had purchased Swiss startup Faceshift, which develops motion-capture technology.\u00a0Prior to the acquisition, Faceshift focused on producing\u00a0motion-capture solutions primarily for gaming and film applications. Most notably, the startup has done work for little film called <em>Star Wars.<\/em><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Faceshift&#8217;s tech integrated with cameras capable of capturing and deciphering depth in a space, then used the visual information picked up by the camera to influence the appearances, actions and facial expressions of digital objects like avatars and animated characters.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So, what does Apple want with Faceshift?\u00a0In typical Apple fashion, it gave a stock non-answer when asked about how it plans to use Faceshift. That\u00a0leaves us to speculate on how, exactly, Apple plans to leverage the work of the company that helped bring Star Wars characters to life. First, though, let&#8217;s talk a little bit about what Faceshift was doing prior to being snatched up by Apple.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Faceshift&#8217;s most recognizable and noteworthy work is obviously with Star Wars, but its tech has a number of applications that go beyond visual effects in film. One such application was in avatars.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Though avatars are frequently used in gaming, the recent uptick in interest in virtual reality and augmented reality applications has seen many content companies from game studios to film studios rethinking the way in which we see ourselves represented digitally. No longer are avatars simply a cartoonish representation of our online selves on Xboxes and Playstations &#8212; they&#8217;ve shown the potential to become key components in the way we perceive ourselves in a digital world.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Faceshift has also dipped its toes into augmented reality, using its tech in conjunction with mirrors. In one instance, FaceShift teamed up\u00a0with AMVBBDO and Pepsi for an AR-based halloween prank that transformed people&#8217;s faces into horrifying <em>It<\/em>-like clown masks. On the less terror-inducing end of the spectrum, possibilities for Faceshift&#8217;s mirror tech included the ability to change or modify one&#8217;s appearance digitally in a retail setting. Say, for example, trying on a prospective pair of glasses not available in shop or experimenting with a new kind of makeup.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Taking into consideration some of Apple&#8217;s other recent acquisitions like <a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/05\/28\/apple-metaio\/\" target=\"_blank\">Metaio<\/a>, some degree of AR-application doesn&#8217;t seem all that far-fetched.\u00a0At its core, augmented reality is about allowing users to interact with digital components in space. Virtual reality, by way of comparison, is an immersive experience &#8212; one that replaces your current reality with one that lives inside of a headset rather than adding components to your current perceived reality. It&#8217;s worth noting, however, that not all applications of AR look like mirror-based pranks, or even Microsoft&#8217;s Hololens.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">What an Apple foray into AR would look like is difficult to guess. Microsoft has been implementing AR through Hololens for gaming and design purposes, but much of that comes down to the headset. Though certainly not impossible, there isn&#8217;t much to indicate right now that Apple&#8217;s planning on\u00a0producing its own headset hardware.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But the reason\u00a0behind acquiring Faceshift (or even Metaio) might not be augmented reality-related at all. Maybe it&#8217;s got more to do with improving features in existing Apple technology, or something\u00a0security-related, like using facial recognition and mapping to improve device and information security.\u00a0Or maybe &#8212; highly unlikely, but maybe &#8212; Apple intends to create its own space opera films.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For now, it&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess how Faceshift might factor into Apple&#8217;s plans for the future. But it almost certainly didn&#8217;t acquire Faceshift without some seriously sophisticated plans for motion capture and facial mapping technology. And, like always, we&#8217;ll be waiting for Apple to read us in.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While it&#8217;s no surprise that the presence of virtual reality is\u00a0weaving its way into many sectors of tech, we&#8217;re still left waiting&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611562,"featured_media":881544,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[64848,359215995,359219847,359234176],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920816"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611562"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920816"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920816\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/881544"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920816"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920816"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920816"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920815,"date":"2015-11-25T11:38:49","date_gmt":"2015-11-25T19:38:49","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920815"},"modified":"2015-11-25T11:38:49","modified_gmt":"2015-11-25T19:38:49","slug":"this-food-quality-startup-ruined-thanksgiving-by-analyzing-turkey-products","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/25\/this-food-quality-startup-ruined-thanksgiving-by-analyzing-turkey-products\/","title":{"rendered":"This food quality startup ruined Thanksgiving by analyzing turkey products"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>There are many ways for tech companies to ruin Thanksgiving dinner.

What better to celebrate a holiday marked by the copious amounts of bearded avians that make their way onto dinner tables around the country than with a report detailing all the contaminants, substitutions, and lies associated with the birds?<\/p>\n<p>Clear Labs went ahead and did just that. A little more than a month after the company released its first food report, which analyzed hot dogs and found that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.csmonitor.com\/The-Culture\/Food\/2015\/1026\/What-s-in-that-hot-dog-More-than-you-might-think-report-finds-video\">a greater than zero percentage<\/a> were problematic in some way, the company has used its food analytics tools to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.clearfood.com\/food_reports\/2015\/the_turkey_report\">examine the turkeys<\/a> that will be served Thursday.<\/p>\n<p>Lingering <a href=\"http:\/\/www.snopes.com\/clear-foods-hot-dog-dna-study\/\">questions<\/a> about the <a href=\"http:\/\/gizmodo.com\/stop-freaking-out-about-human-dna-in-hot-dogs-1739285946\">veracity<\/a> of the hot dog report aside, the turkey report contains some damning information about the not-so-little gobblers on which many of us will gorge this week. Clear Labs said 7 percent of the turkey products it tested contained other meats; 5.5 percent had human DNA; and a total of 13.5 percent of the 158 turkey products it tested were &#8220;problematic.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>These issues led Clear Labs to recommend several brands of turkey products, from the &#8220;Safeway Frozen Young Turkey&#8221; to the Jennie-O turkey burgers, as well as naming the best retailers from which people can buy non-problematic turkey. (Those retailers are, perhaps unsurprisingly, Target, Walmart, and Safeway.)\u00a0Of course, for all the procrastinating amateur chefs out there, Clear Labs might have saved them from purchasing a turkey from a less reputable brand. One person&#8217;s ruined holiday is another person&#8217;s last-minute stomach saver.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how I explained Clear Labs&#8217; food reports <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/10\/22\/clear-labs-uses-kickstarter-to-fund-consumer-reports-for-food-quality\/\">in an earlier piece<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-for-each-report-clea\"><p>For each report Clear Labs needs to buy foods, catalog them, run it through a series of tests, then analyze the results against its own database and several public domain databases it uses to inform its findings. When all this is done the company will assign different brands a Clear Score ranging from zero to 100, which is supposed to indicate the accuracy of the brand\u2019s labeling in terms of ingredients, nutrients, and other information.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>At the time, Clear Labs <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/906785694\/clear-food-your-molecular-guide-to-food?ref=nav_search\">debuted on Kickstarter<\/a> to support more food reports. It was seeking $100,000 for 10 reports that cost roughly $10,000 a piece to create. That campaign was unsuccessful: The company raised roughly $86,900 via the campaign, and because it was held on Kickstarter, it won&#8217;t get any of that money.<\/p>\n<p>Clear Labs isn&#8217;t the only company scrutinizing Thanksgiving. Google also <a href=\"https:\/\/googleblog.blogspot.com\/2015\/11\/google-gobble-thanksgiving-trends-on.html\">published a report<\/a> on what people are searching for before the holiday. Most want to know about Thanksgiving&#8217;s past or who&#8217;s playing on that day. Others look for\u00a0stuffing recipes, and or\u00a0how to cook a\u00a0delicious bird.<\/p>\n<p>That said,\u00a0if you share Clear Labs\u00a0report with your family you can have the benefit of grossing them out before they Google it\u00a0on their own.

One <a href=\"https:\/\/pando.com\/2013\/09\/30\/showrooming-is-more-about-research-than-price-comparison\/\">study from 2013<\/a>\u00a0states that only six percent of people who use their smartphones in a physical store plan to purchase an item online. The rest were seeking more information about the item&#8217;s quality, the reputation of its manufacturer, and other data that might inform a purchase. (I&#8217;m sure that has changed significantly over the last two years, with Amazon&#8217;s image-based physical product search tool helping lead the charge.)\u00a0Still, that could change as more people use their smartphones to find the best prices. Why buy something from a brick-and-mortar store when you can order it online for a lower price, even after figuring in the costs of having it shipped? Unless someone needs the item immediately &#8212; in which case someone probably isn&#8217;t comparison shopping &#8212; the lower price will win most of the time.<\/p>\n<p>Retailers\u00a0could change this by emulating\u00a0Amazon Books&#8217; model of automatically price-matching items\u00a0sold in their stores to items sold on their websites. Right now <a href=\"http:\/\/help.walmart.com\/app\/answers\/detail\/a_id\/31\">there&#8217;s no guarantee<\/a> that a Walmart store will match the price of an item sold on Walmart.com, for example, and other stores have similar policies.\u00a0It&#8217;s almost like retailers\u00a0actually want shoppers\u00a0to treat their stores like showrooms.<\/p>\n<p>The truth is that I don&#8217;t want to check the prices of items on my smartphone. I&#8217;m indecisive enough when it comes to shopping &#8212; I&#8217;ll often grab an item, think of buying it, then put it back right before I get to the checkout aisle. Multiple times. Having to worry about a price discrepancy between a retailer&#8217;s physical location and their\u00a0online store just gives me even more reason to reconsider a purchase. Knowing that the price I see on a shelf is the price I&#8217;d have to pay online would make the whole process easier. (While I could still compare the price to Amazon and other sellers, it would be foolish to expect retailers to automatically match a competitor&#8217;s price instead of requiring shoppers to notice the discrepancy.) That offers all the benefits of shopping at a physical store\u00a0with fewer of the drawbacks.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, Amazon can get away with this because it&#8217;s running a test in one location and is comfortable with wafer-thin margins on the items it sells. Other retailers have their own challenges, like the sheer number of employees required to staff physical locations around the United States, that make it harder for them to pull an Amazon Books and bridge the gap between on-and offline shopping.<\/p>\n<p>But that might be what it takes for these stores to thrive. What happens when Amazon slowly but surely competes more and more with physical locations? The company&#8217;s already <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/SB10001424127887324798904578526820771744676\">expanding its grocery business<\/a>, for instance, and is reducing the amount of time it takes to ship items to customers <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/24\/amazon-is-reportedly-running-a-secret-shipping-operation-in-ohio\/\">with multiple services<\/a>. Amazon Books &#8212; if it&#8217;s successful &#8212; could easily become an Amazon Market. There are other advantages, too. If an item on the shelf is sold out, retail stores could provide incentives for people to pull out their phones and have the item shipped to their home later on. Surely that&#8217;s better than just losing the customer.<\/p>\n<p>Stores could also apply dynamic pricing to certain goods. I&#8217;m not saying they should be dicks and implement &#8220;surge pricing&#8221; the <a href=\"https:\/\/pando.com\/2014\/07\/08\/uber-finally-agrees-with-pando-that-gouging-during-natural-disasters-is-a-dick-move\/\">same way Uber has<\/a> &#8212; that wouldn&#8217;t sit well with shoppers, managers, or regulators &#8212; but it would give the stores more control over the price of items that sit on or fly off the shelves. Why have near-static prices that only change once a week, or when a sale goes on, when you could experiment with different prices to see what works the best?<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps we&#8217;ll see more online sellers follow Amazon&#8217;s lead here. It seems easier for online stores to introduce physical locations than for brick-and-mortar stores to get people to use their websites. The future is digital; better to build for that future and experiment with the past than the other way around. Still, it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising if traditional retailers like Walmart and Target attempt this fusion.<\/p>\n<p>If that happens, it will be caused by Amazon&#8217;s willingness to make shopping easy. It doesn&#8217;t ask people to leave their homes to buy something; nor will it require them to buy something online if they prefer to handle the item in person. The company morphs to suit its customers instead of requiring its customers to change their lives (even if it&#8217;s just by asking them to drive somewhere) to shop.<\/p>\n<p>Doesn&#8217;t that sound better than driving to a brick-and-mortar store and having to check prices on your smartphone to get the best deal? Who wants to waste that trip? Hell, who wants to walk around stores filled with people struggling to push a cart and check prices on their phones at the same time? Grabbing an item, taking it to a register, and getting a fair price on it shouldn&#8217;t be so damn\u00a0hard.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Earlier this month, Amazon opened a bookstore in a mall that used to house a Barnes &amp; Noble.

The core idea here is that anything which is regularly bought could simply be repurchased by pushing a button, or by a sensor realizing that you are, for example, out of milk. A recent VentureBeat piece <a href=\"http:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2015\/11\/12\/sensor-based-passive-buying-expected-to-make-up-15-of-all-purchases-in-2020\/\">predicted<\/a> that 15% of all purchases could be passive buying experiences by 2020. Amazon\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/b\/?node=10667898011&amp;sort=date-desc-rank&amp;lo=digital-text\">Dash button<\/a> is a great example how this is supposed to work, and we have been hearing about the smart fridge for some time.<\/p>\n<p>15% seems like a very plausible number for the overall spend, and could be an under estimate in terms of number of transactions. Spending on food for the home, household supplies, personal care and healthcare was approximately 15% of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.inflatablestartup.com\/infographics\/consumer-spending-2007\/\">spend in 2007<\/a>, less than half the spend on housing itself (typically a single bill per month), and about the same as transport, which is perhaps 5 or 6 payments for most people (assuming a car or monthly commuting capability). It seems reasonable to think about this as being as much as a third of all specific purchases a consumer makes in a given month, which is obviously a huge change in the way products are purchased.<\/p>\n<p>Part of the promise here is addressing the issue that customers don\u2019t want to shop for single staples, today they manage this by buying in bulk, or periodic trips to the supermarket. To beat that experience the promise needs to be not far from \u201cpush a button and the laundry detergent is to be magically in the utility closet.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to deliver on that promise?<\/strong><br \/>\nPerhaps the biggest challenge here is in managing delivery of single items to the home. This experience is already stretched, unless you are one of the lucky few in a doorman building the experience of using ecommerce solutions today is far too often an experience in getting used to where the Fedex office is in your city, and wondering why UPS isn\u2019t open at the weekends.<\/p>\n<p>Scott Rafer, organizer of <a href=\"http:\/\/haulery.com\/\">Haulery<\/a>, and investor\/advisor to several companies in the home delivery and logistics space, commented &#8220;IoT driven shopping needs to focus on delivering end-to-end customer satisfaction, rather than optimizing a single piece of the puzzle&#8230; which is what I see too many of today&#8217;s ideas doing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There are various solutions here, but none have obviously achieved critical mass yet.<\/p>\n<li>Scheduled deliveries can work well for some, but for many the scheduling doesn\u2019t work with the rest of life, and again being home during a window is not the same as replenishment by button.<\/li>\n<li>On-demand delivery services are emerging, and so far work best in crowded cities (hardly staple items, but interesting to see Postmates and Apple working <a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/11\/17\/apple-brings-same-day-delivery-to-new-york-through-expanded-postmates-partnership\/\">together<\/a> in New York).<\/li>\n<li>Third party drop off\/collection locations, like lockers in stores or car parks, work quite well, but are still not delivering the level of convenience that sensor based shopping promises, and typically need a certain level of density.<\/li>\n<li>Smart locks\/trusted home access have just started to become possible (August and the like might enable this, for example). Are we ready to have a delivery service in the house, even if well monitored? Drones of course can get round this by delivering to back gardens, or similar, assuming smart enough guidance systems.<\/li>\n<p>\nThe delivery challenge is an example of a topic I\u2019ll be coming back to in future posts- innovation is rarely co-ordinated, yet at the same time assuming the rest of the world won\u2019t change as you innovate in one area often leads to dead ends (fax machines anyone?).<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are you going to buy?<\/strong><br \/>\nSensor-based or automated buying also creates real challenges for the food retail and CPG players- an entire industry has been built around managing shelf space and working out how to best display products. What will happen to supermarkets? Do they become (even more) semi-public warehouses, with most of the interactions being at the drone dock or Postmates handoff point, with automated pickers dominating the aisles while a few hold-outs push trolleys around? <\/p>\n<p>For the CPG companies themselves \u201claundry detergent as a service\u201d is going to change significantly how they have to market products. Instead of jockeying for shelf space, companies will be faced with consumers making longer term commitments to specific products, not because they necessarily want to, but simply because it\u2019s taking away from the one touch convenience promise to have to think about which detergent or which ice cream you want today. Offering a coupon or 2 for 1 or the like won\u2019t cut it any more. Consumer brands and products proliferated with the emergence of the self-service supermarket, will the current level of variety die with it too?<\/p>\n<p>Net- I don\u2019t really want to have to buy laundry detergent at the store, but we face an awkward few interrelated innovation steps, not just the development of individual IoT sensors\/switches in the home, and likely changes in how products are sold, before auto-replenishment beats what we have to do today.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of the (many) promises of home automation solutions is automated grocery and staple replenishment.

It <a href=\"http:\/\/shop.panasonic.com\/cameras-and-camcorders\/camera-and-camcorder-accessories\/camera-accessories\/DMW-SFU1-VLOG.html\">charged $99<\/a> for a firmware update for its top of line GH4 still and video camera.<\/p>\n<p>Given the price tag, Panasonic&#8217;s move begs the question: Does a firmware update that adds critical functionality equate to a new product that can be charged for?<\/p>\n<p>In the camera world firmware updates are widely discussed with owners lobbying manufacturers for changes. Intrinsic to this lobbying is the belief, and the reality, that software changes can significantly improve hardware. Camera hardware performance is highly governed by software and firmware updates can change core functionality.<\/p>\n<p>The power of the market was on display most recently when consumers demanded a firmware update from Sony that impacted how Sony\u2019s flagship camera the A7R mark II, which is intended to take on market leaders Nikon and Canon, processes raw image files. Less than 60 days after the camera was released, Sony gave in and announced <a href=\"http:\/\/cameratimes.org\/firmware-update-sony-a7rii-uncompressed-14-bit-raw-coming-mid-october\/\">it would release<\/a> an update.<\/p>\n<p>But Panasonic\u2019s move is different. The $99 firmare update doesn\u2019t fix anything. Rather, it adds something called V-Log, which effectively uses improved software and algorithms to provide greater dynamic range. What that means is the GH4 can capture a greater range of light to dark before the shadows become black and the highlights become blown out whites.<\/p>\n<p>Many owners of the high end camera expressed displeasure at having to pay for the firmware update. After all, they\u2019d never had to. I mean, who has ever had to pay for a firmware update for a consumer product? And both Panasonic and competitors have routinely used firmware updates to add functionality like better shutter speed, alter image quality, and provide quicker autofocus. All for free.<\/p>\n<p>The GH4, at around $1500, is a prosumer camera, and Panasonic is betting that such an audience is sophisticated enough to see the value of V-Log and thus willing to pay for it. It would be hard to imagine a company charging for a firmware update on a $500 camera.<\/p>\n<p>Still, Panasonic\u2019s move points to an important shift in IoT related to how consumers view a product. Put simply, they no longer view the release date of the product as the end of product development. And as more and more products gain connectivity, consumer expectations that products will continually be\u00a0improved with wireless software updates will only strengthen.<\/p>\n<p>The poster child and early adopter of this philosophy has been Tesla. Over the summer it announced that it would use its <a href=\"http:\/\/www.extremetech.com\/extreme\/211597-tesla-amps-up-model-s-self-driving-capabilities-with-firmware-update\">next software update<\/a> to improve its autosteer and auto parallel parking features. The Tesla Model S resembles more of a consumer electronics product than an automotive vehicle, and a big reason for that is that it has embraced the modern design ethos of continual improvements through software. The added benefit for brands embracing this philosophy is that it gives them a means to further engage their customers after the product sale.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s this last point about continual engagement that should give pause to\u00a0those in consumer IoT. If you can continually improve a smart lock\u2019s functionality by say, improving latency, or the algorithms intrinsic to a learning thermostat to save more energy, you have a way to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.<\/p>\n<p>Will consumers pay for these improvements? I think that\u2019s unlikely, but not impossible, particularly if the update really provides significantly better functioning or a must have feature.<\/p>\n<p>One coda on the Panasonic story. In 2011 it launched its GH2 camera, which wound up becoming well loved by many videographers. Why? Well, a big reason is that a <a href=\"http:\/\/nofilmschool.com\/2011\/07\/panasonic-gh2s-firmware-hacked-features\">smart programmer<\/a> actually hacked the firmware to drastically improve the bitrate of the video recording, providing better video quality. He was effectively saying, I know this hardware can be pushed harder, and I\u2019m going to do just that.<\/p>\n<p>Panasonic may have learned their lesson this time around. Improve the firmware or someone else will. If they can charge for it, all the better.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In September Panasonic did something indicative of just how much connected devices have changed marketing, sales and consumer expectations.

There was no announcement in the <a href=\"http:\/\/newsroom.fb.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook Newsroom<\/a>; the app just showed up in the <a href=\"http:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.facebook.workchat\" target=\"_blank\">Google Play store<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0and was called out in a <a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/11\/20\/facebook-at-work-gets-its-own-version-of-messenger-with-debut-of-work-chat\/\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch article<\/a>. Work Chat is available for Android devices only now; an iOS version is in development and expected to be available soon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Work Chat is the corporate equivalent of Facebook Messenger. Those applications appear to have the same user experience and feature set, although TechCrunch noted that Work Chat allows individuals to temporarily turn off their notifications, so as to not be disturbed when on vacation and when other personal activities are prioritized.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Work Chat is intended solely for organizations that are Facebook at Work customers. Anyone can download and install the app, but it will not work without a Facebook at Work login.<\/span><\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Screenshot_2015-11-20-14-13-51.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-248528 size-medium aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Screenshot_2015-11-20-14-13-51-180x300.png\" alt=\"Screenshot_2015-11-20-14-13-51\" width=\"180\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>\n<p>Facebook at Work is still in closed beta, so very few companies and individuals will be able to use Work Chat today.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"is-this%c2%a0a-market-disrupto\" ><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Is This\u00a0a Market Disruptor?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>While it\u2019s impossible to gauge the actual market impact of Facebook\u2019s Work Chat at this point, we can draw some conclusions about its potential effect. First, it will boost awareness of, and interest in, chat-based, real-time communication tools in organizations of all size. Individuals who use Facebook and its Messenger app in the personal lives will push their IT departments to consider the Facebook at Work and Work Chat combination.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In all likelihood, many organizations will try Work Chat, at least in a pilot implementation. It\u2019s been reported that Facebook at Work will be available in a free version that will likely have a limited feature set and support. If that is true and the same applies to Work Chat, then a company\u2019s cost to try the app is negligible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Facebook\u2019s land and expand strategy for enterprise sales may indeed work and, if it does, Work Chat would likely be swept along with the tide of Facebook at Work adoption. Facebook has already said that some of the roughly 300 companies in the Facebook at Work trial program have announced their intent to scale its use next year. Heineken <a href=\"http:\/\/recode.net\/2015\/09\/16\/facebook-is-about-to-take-the-training-wheels-off-facebook-at-work\/\" target=\"_blank\">has already grown<\/a> its user base from 40 to 550.

Could the company also reduce its reliance on shipping companies like UPS and FedEx by running its own air cargo operations instead of using others&#8217; planes?<\/p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http:\/\/motherboard.vice.com\/read\/a-secretive-air-cargo-operation-is-running-in-ohio-and-signs-point-to-amazon\">report from Motherboard indicates<\/a> that Amazon is most likely behind a secretive operation from an Ohio airport dedicated to shipping consumer goods. If the report is accurate, it would appear that Amazon is at least testing a system that could give it more control over the paths its wares take to reach consumers.<\/p>\n<p>This control would help Amazon sidestep any issues other carriers face. Instead of being at the mercy of UPS and FedEx, the company would be responsible for making sure items reach their new owners on time, and it would have the power to fix anything\u00a0that goes wrong instead of just mopping up after others&#8217; messes.<\/p>\n<p>It could also help reduce shipping costs. As Motherboard notes in its report:<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-with-shipping-as-wit\"><p>With shipping, as with all of <a href=\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2015\/07\/24\/investing\/amazon-worth-more-than-walmart\/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon\u2019s $250 billion empire<\/a>, efficiency is key. Amazon\u2019s net shipping cost in 2014 was $4.2 billion, up from $3.5 billion in 2013, according to a 10-K filing from 2014 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With delivery costs weighing heavily on Amazon and ongoing headaches with UPS and other third party shippers, the company has a lot to gain from its own logistics network, whether just supplementing shipments in peak seasons or cutting out other carriers entirely.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This is what Amazon is all about &#8212; owning everything its customers might ever have to interact with. Take digital media, for example. Amazon sells the devices used to access online content; runs\u00a0services used to stream that content; and operates\u00a0the network that delivers all those bits and bytes to people&#8217;s devices.<\/p>\n<p>Those efforts pay off by making Amazon an integral part of digital media, convincing people to continue purchasing things from its website, and even create <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/aws-estimated-to-be-worth-160-billion-2015-11\">an incredibly valuable business<\/a> devoted to the cloud computing market. Why wouldn&#8217;t the company want to replicate that success in the physical realm?<\/p>\n<p>Given all that, it shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise that Amazon might be testing its own air cargo operations. If anything, it&#8217;s more surprising that it&#8217;s taken this long for a company whose greatest strength is owning every aspect of whatever business it&#8217;s in took this long to run an experiment like the one taking place now.
