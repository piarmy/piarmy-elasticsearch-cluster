It doesn&#8217;t surface\u00a0private content; only things people have decided to upload to Live Stories and thus make available for public viewing.]<\/em><\/p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.snapchat.com\/post\/133805828475\/story-explorer\">new Snapchat feature<\/a> called Story Explorer will allow people in New York and Los Angeles to view specific moments from perspectives shared by\u00a0other users.<\/p>\n<p>Snapchat says in a blog post today that Story Explorer works by taking Snaps curated into its Live Stories and making other Snaps of the same event available with a swipe. (That sentence would have been gobbledygook just a few years ago.) Put another way: It&#8217;s like\u00a0viewing a movie through multiple views instead of just one.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It\u2019s the first time you\u2019ll be able to experience that incredible game-winning dunk from thousands of perspectives throughout the stadium &#8212; or feel like you\u2019re right there on the scene when breaking news unfolds,&#8221; Snapchat says. It adds that\u00a0this is possible because its users contribute &#8220;so many diverse perspectives&#8221; all at once.<\/p>\n<p>A report from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/business\/technology\/la-fi-tn-snapchat-story-explorer-20151123-story.html\">the Los Angeles Times<\/a> says that Snapchat&#8217;s curators will still be tasked with choosing the content that appears in the company&#8217;s Live Stories. This feature simply makes it easier for people interested in a particular moment to view relevant\u00a0content without\u00a0requiring the curator to find similar Snaps.<\/p>\n<p>Story Explorer feels a bit like Snapchat&#8217;s attempt to replicate the hashtag. That omnipresent symbol often serves as a gateway to similar content, but it&#8217;s limited because it requires people to categorize whatever they&#8217;re sharing. Snapchat&#8217;s doing something similar with an automated\u00a0system that requires no user effort.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Story Explorer relies on technology developed by our research team to provide more depth to every Snap in a Story,&#8221; the company says in its blog post. &#8220;When you see a moment that inspires or excites you, simply swipe up to see more Snaps of that same moment &#8211; from every perspective.&#8221; Who needs hashtags?<\/p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see how Snapchat&#8217;s users respond to having their Snaps made available to anyone who swipes up on something shared to a Live Story. Despite the app&#8217;s utility as something more than a sexting service, its beginning as a private and ephemeral social network doesn&#8217;t lend itself to features like this.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Update:\u00a0<\/strong>Story Explorer doesn&#8217;t surface private content; it only shows Snaps that have been shared to Live Stories. This could expand a Snap&#8217;s potential audience &#8212; its entire purpose for being is surfacing more content &#8212; but it won&#8217;t take someone&#8217;s private communications and make them available to the public.<\/p>\n<p>Not from the person sharing the Snap&#8217;s perspective, anyway. For everyone else this little bit of communal voyeurism makes perfect sense. Why view something from one angle when you can view it from a thousand? And who cares about how Snapchat began\u00a0if this is what it is now? The\u00a0first answer&#8217;s clear; the second isn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[This post has been updated to fix an error related to how Snaps will be added to Story Explorer.

The company behind the virtual casino found that most of its users (80 percent) sign in to the app with Facebook&#8217;s login feature. It also used\u00a0the social network to drive increasing\u00a0traffic to the game.<\/p>\n<p>Other case studies have been used to drive home the same point: Facebook&#8217;s attempts to woo the developer community with new tools are working. Given the rocky past the company had with developers, especially those working on games that went viral before fading into obscurity, that might be a tough line to sell.<\/p>\n<p>Just look to the cautionary tale of Zynga. That company used Facebook&#8217;s network to make games like &#8220;FarmVille&#8221; the darling of the social games market. Then, Facebook <a href=\"http:\/\/arstechnica.com\/business\/2013\/09\/how-zynga-went-from-social-gaming-powerhouse-to-has-been\/3\/\">made it harder<\/a> for the company to spam users with messages about their virtual farms, and &#8220;FarmVille&#8221; became a pale vision of its past glory.<\/p>\n<p>Zynga&#8217;s fall makes it hard to believe that other companies can find lasting success on Facebook. That&#8217;s\u00a0a hell of a counterpoint to case studies like this: Facebook could&#8217;ve written something similar about Zynga&#8217;s past successes, but that would only describe the highs\u00a0it reached before it came crashing down.<\/p>\n<p>Still, it&#8217;s clear that Facebook wants to earn back the trust of developers who can build things for its apps. (This is especially tru for App Instal ads, which Zuckerberg has long touted as a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/ericjackson\/2014\/04\/29\/facebook-and-app-install-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\">big deal<\/a> for the company.) Sometimes that manifests as <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.facebook.com\/blog\/post\/2015\/03\/25\/introducing-messenger-platform-and-businesses-on-messenger\/\">the addition of an app platform<\/a> to\u00a0Facebook&#8217;s increasingly popular Messenger service; otherwise it crops up as tools like Analytics for Apps, which debuted around the same time.<\/p>\n<p>Then it writes up case studies like this to show that, at least for a while, these tools can make a real difference for developers. That certainly appears to be the case for DoubleU Games: Facebook&#8217;s tools helped the company find more users, keep them engaged, and figure out how it could squeeze more money out of &#8217;em.<\/p>\n<p>The trick is for these companies to use all these tools to support a lasting business. Until then we can&#8217;t be sure these case studies are capturing more than a snapshot of companies that are cresting the peak of their success. So, sure, look to DoubleU Games to see what Facebook can do. Just remember Zynga, too.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook is tooting the horns of its various developer tools by sharing how DoubleU Games, a\u00a0South Korean developer, used them to learn&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611561,"featured_media":908548,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359234170,20054,359218214],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920796"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611561"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920796"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920796\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/908548"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920796"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920796"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920796"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920792,"date":"2015-11-23T08:16:19","date_gmt":"2015-11-23T16:16:19","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920792"},"modified":"2015-11-23T08:16:19","modified_gmt":"2015-11-23T16:16:19","slug":"breaker-mixes-content-discovery-with-a-messaging-platform","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/23\/breaker-mixes-content-discovery-with-a-messaging-platform\/","title":{"rendered":"&#8216;Breaker&#8217; mixes content discovery with a messaging platform"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Holiday dinners hosted by my wife&#8217;s family are bound to have three things: sugary desserts; copious amounts of wine; and heated discussions about politics. The exact mix changes depending on the holiday, but each of those things is bound to be there, just as sure as there will be a smorgasbord of different foods.<\/p>\n<p>A new messaging app called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.breakerchat.com\/\">Breaker<\/a> wants to encourage people to have those conversations without requiring them to gorge themselves on turkey or guzzle untold glasses of wine every time they want to discuss something in the news. Instead, it blends content discovery features with a dedicated message platform.<\/p>\n<p>The app works by asking people to identify their interests. Once they do, it will recommend content it culls from hundreds of different sources to them. If they like what they read and want to discuss it with someone else, they can do so right from the app, instead of switching between services\u00a0like Nuzzel and WhatsApp.<\/p>\n<p>Breaker chief executive Shailo Rao says the app is supposed to facilitate private, meaningful conversations. &#8220;Instead of broadcasting to all your friends or all the people who follow you,&#8221; like you would via\u00a0social networks like Facebook and Twitter, &#8220;it&#8217;s all about having a focused conversation with just a few friends.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Those conversations are facilitated by a feature that allows people to send the same link to multiple people either as a group or as individual conversations. This makes it easier to talk about things with more than one person without forcing people to participate in hellish group messages they can never escape.<\/p>\n<p>Rao says this feature rose from research he did as an intern at Google, when he found that Google Chat users would often send links to multiple people at the same time, but didn&#8217;t want to lump everyone into the same conversation.\u00a0This seems small, but in day-to-day usage it could make life a lot easier for people.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_920794\" style=\"width: 251px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/2-start-interesting-conversations-breaker.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-920794\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/2-start-interesting-conversations-breaker-241x300.jpg\" alt=\"Breaker in action via its iOS app.\" width=\"241\" height=\"300\" data-attribution-source=\"http:\/\/Breaker\" data-attribution=\"Breaker\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/2-start-interesting-conversations-breaker-241x300.jpg 241w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/2-start-interesting-conversations-breaker-647x804.jpg 647w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/2-start-interesting-conversations-breaker-968x1203.jpg 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/2-start-interesting-conversations-breaker-113x140.jpg 113w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/2-start-interesting-conversations-breaker-1207x1500.jpg 1207w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/2-start-interesting-conversations-breaker-300x373.jpg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/2-start-interesting-conversations-breaker-320x398.jpg 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/2-start-interesting-conversations-breaker-640x795.jpg 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/2-start-interesting-conversations-breaker-804x999.jpg 804w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/2-start-interesting-conversations-breaker.jpg 1239w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Breaker in action via its iOS app.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>That&#8217;s the thinking behind another feature that allows Breaker users to hold conversations through the platform even if their friends don&#8217;t use the app. If that&#8217;s the case, Breaker will send an SMS message to the non-user with a link to a Web view where they can see the article being discussed and talk about it.<\/p>\n<p>That isn&#8217;t the most elegant process &#8212; who wants to tap a link to have a conversation through a mobile Web browser? &#8212; it could help Breaker sidestep the problem of consumers being overwhelmed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.com\/2015\/08\/time-to-ditch-texting\/\">the sheer number of services<\/a> they have to use if they want to be able to communicate with all their friends.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;People have enough messaging apps on their phones,&#8221; Rao says. &#8220;It&#8217;s okay because there&#8217;s a centralized inbox with the lockscreen, so people can manage multiple messaging apps because that&#8217;s the pathway into them, but it is tough to get all your friends to download another messaging app.&#8221; That&#8217;s understating it.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also the problem of convincing people to use another content discovery platform. Many could already use something like Flipboard or Nuzzel, which have the benefits of being around longer and name recognition, and they might not be keen to switch to a different app just to make it easier to chat with friends.<\/p>\n<p>Breaker has raised $375,000 from Tandem Capital and undisclosed angel investors. The app is currently available on iOS, and will debut on Android later. Right now it&#8217;s available for free, but Rao says eventually the app could utilize in-app purchases or advertising, once it has a large enough user base to do so.<\/p>\n<p>Will that happen? It depends on how well the politically-charged conversations <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/2015\/11\/21\/456942196\/the-pitfalls-of-politics-at-holiday-dinner-and-how-to-handle-them\">held around dinner tables<\/a> across the country translate to a messaging app, how many people want to download another messaging app when they can send links via existing apps without too much hassle, or how often people really talk about their interests with friends and family with any sort of depth or meaningfulness.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Holiday dinners hosted by my wife&#8217;s family are bound to have three things: sugary desserts; copious amounts of wine; and heated discussions&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611561,"featured_media":920793,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359234169,66334790,63369739,359234168],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920792"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611561"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920792"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920792\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920793"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920792"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920792"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920792"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":941018,"date":"2015-11-21T05:15:56","date_gmt":"2015-11-21T13:15:56","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/?p=248516"},"modified":"2015-11-21T05:15:56","modified_gmt":"2015-11-21T13:15:56","slug":"microsofts-lumia-950-the-shape-of-things-to-come","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/21\/microsofts-lumia-950-the-shape-of-things-to-come\/","title":{"rendered":"Microsoft&#8217;s Lumia 950: the shape of things to come?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/things-to-come.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-248518 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/things-to-come.jpg\" alt=\"things to come\" width=\"360\" \/><\/a>Peter Bright of Ars Technica did us all a great favor by\u00a0producing a <a href=\"http:\/\/arstechnica.com\/gadgets\/2015\/11\/lumia-950-review-windows-phone-finally-has-a-new-flagship-will-anyone-care\/\">detailed evaluation<\/a> of Microsoft&#8217;s Lumia 950 Windows phone. I will leave to one side the review of the 950&#8217;s phone features, and zoom in on just one capability that Microsoft has debuted: using a new service called Continuum, the 950 can be used as the central module of a PC: you just connect its &#8216;dock&#8217; to a TV or monitor, and connect to a mouse, touchpad, and\/or keypad, and you are running full Windows apps.<\/p>\n<p>As Bright states,<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-the-connections-can-15\" ><p>The connections can be wired, wireless, or a mix of the two. Wired connections use a new accessory, the Display Dock. This plugs into the USB type C port on the phone, and it offers three USB ports (which can be used for mice, keyboards, memory sticks, and maybe more) along with full size HDMI and DisplayPort ports for connecting a monitor. For wireless, there&#8217;s Bluetooth and Miracast. Either way, the concept is the same: on the big screen, you get a desktop of sorts, and can use this to run Universal Windows Apps. When run in Continuum&#8217;s &#8220;desktop,&#8221; they look and work much the same way that they do in regular desktop Windows 10. Keyboard shortcuts like ctrl-c and ctrl-v work, they contain buttons and other UI elements that are mouse-appropriate rather than finger-sized; it&#8217;s pretty neat. You can even alt-tab between running programs.<\/p>\n<p>While connected in this way, the phone continues to run as normal. The big screen has a Start menu, and apps launched from there open on the big screen. The phone&#8217;s screen has its own Start menu, and apps launched from that open on the phone. This enables side-by-side multitasking. If you open the Continuum app on the phone, you can use the phone&#8217;s screen as a kind of touchpad to control the big screen, including support for two finger scrolling. Similarly, it can act as a keyboard if you don&#8217;t have a hardware keyboard available.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/continuum.png\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-248517 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/continuum.png\" alt=\"continuum\" width=\"300\" height=\"533\" \/><\/a>\n<p>Rather than dwell on the specifics of this implementation of these ideas, I&#8217;d like to throw a few more conjectures in the hopper:\u00a0Imagine a tablet\/display device based on the premise that you&#8217;d be using the computing power of your smartphone rather than an additional motherboard in the display. After all, your smartphone is the device closest to you: the one you always have nearby. So these two devices can be easily configured so that the phone usings the display with a single button push. The phone display converts to a touchpad, and the display cover doubles as a keyboard under the control of the phone.<\/p>\n<p>This configuration supports PC mode. But another configuration would allow the display to act as a touch sensitive tablet, and again, relying on the computing horsepower of the phone.<\/p>\n<p>So, I predict that in the near future, we will see systems like this emerging from other vendors. I&#8217;m hoping for something from Apple like this.<\/p>\n<p>One problem is that vendors would like us to buy multiple devices, in principle. However, a Continuum-inspired future\u00a0is coming.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine going to work with your phone, and display\/keyboard. You take an available desk, and connect to the 34&#8243; Dell curved ultrawide monitor there, putting your phone into Mac OS X mode, and also available as touchpad. Your files are all accessible via Google Drive, and your keyboard is the cover of the tablet\/display, which you configure to act as a second monitor. Later in the day you head out for a business trip, and a few hours later, when you get to the hotel you set up a similar configuration using the monitor on the desk there.

The average hospital reinvests in MRI machines <a href=\"http:\/\/www.skylakes.org\/about-us\/news\/newsdetail.aspx?a=8361\" target=\"_blank\">every five years or so<\/a> at a cost of millions of dollars. Yet, comparatively little has been directed toward unlocking some of the most valuable information health insurers, physicians, and hospitals already have about you.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. produces <a href=\"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/rdcms-himss\/files\/production\/public\/FileDownloads\/HIMSS%20Health%20Story%20Project_FactSheet.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">1.2 billion clinical care documents annually<\/a>, but nearly 80 percent of the data they contain is unstructured. This information is difficult for entities to understand and use. The medical chart contains a record of your health care &#8212; visits with doctors and hospitals, treatments, procedures, medications, diagnoses, and the results of workups. It is the key to understanding your health and improving the care provided to you. Yet, the challenge of accessing and making that information useable is immense.<\/p>\n<p>The typical medical chart is stored in various fragments across different locations and systems. Your primary care physician has their record of you but not the record from your cardiologist or gynecologist or from the emergency department doctor you saw six months ago for bronchitis, for example. Imagine your entire medical record as a jigsaw puzzle in which the pieces are scattered and stored in different locations and different types of boxes, each of which is hard to open. No wonder people feel as if they are repeating themselves every time they visit a medical facility.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, technologies that make sense of the immense amount of data and preserve the patient narrative are rapidly emerging. With the rise of \u00a0cognitive computing, natural language processing (NLP), and data science in health care, we now have the power to unlock untold value in health care data and drive proactive, targeted health care.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"enabling-insights\">Enabling insights<\/h3>\n<p>The first step is being able to make sense of the rich narrative in the medical chart whether from a primary care physician or specialist practicing in different organizations, different regions or both. While your doctor is familiar with your record, the medical system as a whole is not. So medical care continues to be reactive rather than proactive.<\/p>\n<p>This is where cognitive computing and NLP enter the picture. NLP tools can help extract data from free text found in the patient record creating valuable material for big data technologies to analyze. Cognitive computing platforms use NLP along with pattern recognition models and data mining techniques to simulate human thought processes in a self-learning computerized system. A cognitive computing platform refines the way it looks for patterns as well as the way it processes data so it becomes capable of anticipating new problems and modeling possible solutions.<\/p>\n<p>Once doctors have access to patient data, the question is how can they use it to accurately predict what treatments are most effective. Data science gives rise to a better understanding of the relationship between treatments, outcomes and patients. Now health care organizations have the tools to combine data from different sources and paint a more complete picture of the patient to personalize their treatment.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"a-data-rich-health-care-future\">A data-rich health care future<\/h3>\n<p>These technologies give health care organizations the ability to access the previously untapped 80 percent of health care data so providers have real-time access to information and a deeper understanding of patients. If doctors know more about patients, then they can make more intelligent decisions that will result in quicker recoveries, fewer readmissions, lower infection rates and fewer medical errors. Ultimately, it will supercharge the value of care.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond benefiting individual patients, access to this data will also create a living laboratory of clinical data to better inform health care decisions. Now that information about clinical care can be machine read, physicians can access it and base research on the everyday clinical care of millions of patients. Rather than depending on narrowly designed studies that do not directly relate to individual patients, health care organizations and researchers can learn about health care delivery from everyday real-world data.<\/p>\n<p>Big data technologies can make use of information that is locked up in our medical charts in different systems and locations so we can transform how we look at and interpret patient health. With access to the untapped 80 percent of patient data and tools that put the data to use, we can change the delivery and consumption of health care as we know it, and usher in a new data revolution in health care that will improve patient care and result in high-quality outcomes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Darren is the chief executive at Apixio.

Nearly all technologists, IT executives, and analysts subscribe to the idea that public cloud and on-premises computing both have a place in modern enterprise IT strategy.<\/p>\n<p>A hybrid end state isn\u2019t a bridging tactic or a strategic consolation prize, but a desirable outcome. In fact, a strong case could be made that a hybrid model allows for specialized optimization based on use cases \u2013 there are many scenarios both now and in the future that may map best to on-premises or public cloud.<\/p>\n<p>There are two primary ways to implement a hybrid end state: asymmetric and symmetric.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>1. Asymmetric<\/strong> \u2013 In asymmetric orientations, an enterprise consumes public cloud as one endpoint, and builds an on-premises cloud that is a distinctly separate, second endpoint. For example, we could look at the Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) layer and say that an enterprise could use OpenStack on-premises and AWS in public cloud, and use processes, operations, and a brokering abstraction across the two endpoints to help normalize the consumption of IaaS regardless of what side of the firewall it came from.<\/p>\n<p>In asymmetric hybridity, the technology used on-premises is different than that used in the public cloud, resulting in the need for reconciliation and the need to accept a lossy factor (i.e. the two technologies may have different features and evolutionary paths) since points of differentiation between the two need to be ignored or marginalized to ensure consistency.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><strong>2. Symmetric<\/strong> \u2013 Symmetric hybridity means that an enterprises on-premises assets and public assets are using the same technology, and that technology reconciles the assets on both sides of the firewall as a single endpoint. An example of this would be a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) layer that can be installed on-premises that could use local OSes and OSes from one or more public clouds all under one logical instance of the PaaS.<\/p>\n<p>The PaaS hides the fact that resources are coming from disparate providers and only exposes that fact where appropriate (e.g. at the policy definition level to shape deployments). In this case, the PaaS is the single endpoint where interaction happens, and resources on both sides are used as resource units by the PaaS. Any organizational processes and consumption processes would be ignorant to the idea that a border exists in the resource model.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"pros-and-cons-of-symmetric-and\">Pros and cons of symmetric and asymmetric models<\/h3>\n<p>Symmetric models guarantee that anyone within the enterprise consuming cloud infrastructure is shielded from the distinction between on- and off-premises resources and capabilities. If the end user \u00a0of cloud infrastructure (e.g. a developer or data scientist) is required to acknowledge any asymmetry, they will have to deal with it in their project. This explicit need to deal with a fractured cloud creates an immediate \u201ctax\u201d related to consuming infrastructure and it will generate consumption biases.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if one side of the asymmetric deployment is easier to consume than the other, then an end user will prefer that even if the not-so-easy side is more aligned with the project, and will cause IT itself a number of headaches when it comes to operations related to that project.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to understand symmetry doesn\u2019t mean the on-premises and public cloud side of a hybrid deployment must be equal. Certainly, workloads may need on-premises or public assets to satisfy certain requirements the other side couldn\u2019t possibly satisfy.<\/p>\n<p>What symmetry guarantees is that a workload that is indifferent to on-premises or public never be exposed to those concepts. Symmetry also ensures a workload with requirements that can only be satisfied by one part of a hybrid cloud or another is never exposed to the technical divide between the clouds. Instead, a workload communicates its preference in the language of requirements.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"eventual-symmetry\">Eventual symmetry<\/h3>\n<p>Asymmetric models might be good starting points or appropriate for certain layers of the infrastructure stack, but they\u2019re not ideal as a final end state. Symmetric models are clearly superior in almost all other aspects.<\/p>\n<p>In response to this, CIOs should pursue a strategy of \u2018Eventual Symmetry.\u2019 Eventual symmetry means that any cloud strategy must:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Choose symmetric models over asymmetric models where possible<\/li>\n<li>If asymmetric is the only possible approach, ensure that the implementation lends itself to eventually being replaced by a symmetric model or that processes and technology be used to abstract the asymmetry into a perceived symmetric model<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>By establishing eventual symmetry as a core cloud strategy pillar, a CIO can guarantee that any disjointedness in their strategy will be resolved. He or she can also ensure consumers of IT resources are abstracted away from details related to on-premises and off-premises.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sinclair is CEO and cofounder of\u00a0Apprenda.\u00a0 The idea that hybrid cloud is the end state of enterprise computing is no longer controversial.&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":402,"featured_media":920787,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359234167,150060,359222571],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920786"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/402"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920786"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920786\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920787"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920786"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920786"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920786"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":941019,"date":"2015-11-19T16:02:41","date_gmt":"2015-11-20T00:02:41","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/?p=248514"},"modified":"2015-11-19T16:02:41","modified_gmt":"2015-11-20T00:02:41","slug":"squares-ipo-are-payments-really-that-hard","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/19\/squares-ipo-are-payments-really-that-hard\/","title":{"rendered":"Square\u2019s IPO- are payments really that hard?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Square\u2019s public market debut has put a focus how hard the payments business is, even for one of the apparent leaders. Is great design and user experience going to be enough to create and maintain a revolution, or is it just that, a beautiful product that ultimately struggles to be an amazing business?<\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s so new here?<\/strong><br \/>\nOne of the payment back end capabilities that was revolutionary behind Square was the extension of the <a href=\"http:\/\/digitaltransactions.net\/news\/story\/Cover-Story_The-Rise-of-Merchant-Aggregators\">merchant aggregation model<\/a> for credit card acceptance from the internet (which Paypal has used so well) to the real world through an elegant point of sale solution. Innovating in one point of the chain the small merchant counter top (in this case beautiful design for the card payments themselves, combined with a new approach to credit card acceptance for merchants) is certainly interesting, but often ignores the other changes that are happening in the broader ecosystem- ubiquitous smart mobile devices are likely to have a very big impact on credit cards, as my colleague Jon Collins <a href=\"https:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/2015\/10\/mobile-payments-go-mainstream-is-it-time-to-say-goodbye-to-the-plastic\/\">pointed out recently<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Small businesses don\u2019t stick around<\/strong><br \/>\nThe businesses Square deals with themselves go out of business <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessappraisalblog.com\/14\/\">very fast<\/a>. Smaller businesses tend to go out of business with depressing frequency. It\u2019s quite likely that even with perfect retention at the operating level, enough of the small businesses that Square services will go out of business in a given year to create what would look like a churn problem.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What services complement payments?<\/strong><br \/>\nSquare, like others in the payments space, has experimented with a variety of other related services. Part of the challenge here is that payments are typically the end of chain, and unless you have a loyalty type program based on purchases, it\u2019s not been clear how a payments player is well positioned to deliver upstream services- it\u2019s more likely that payments might complement another service than vice versa. There are more and more examples of good loyalty programs with embedded mobile commerce as part of the offer, but these are usually account based systems, which tend to make less sense for smaller businesses with infrequent purchasers. More basically- many embedded mobile commerce and account based payments take the card out of the equation- most of this is in experiment mode, but it is happening, and clearly works well for small start ups like, say, Uber.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Larger businesses can get better deals<\/strong><br \/>\nSquare is calling out the Starbucks deal as a separate line item in their financials, which makes sense, especially if it was \u201ca disaster,\u201d as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/starbucks-deal-with-square-is-over-a-bust-2015-10\">some have characterized it<\/a>. Perhaps more generally relevant is the challenge that as customers get larger they can typically start to negotiate better credit card deals with providers, so many of Square\u2019s customers will either stay small, or grow out of being customers, without that necessarily creating larger Square customers. Square is certainly not the only SaaS business with this challenge. Many of the advantages of SaaS on the user side are based around flexibility, and typically per unit costs are relatively high because of that. Once a business has a predictable base load of usage of resource x, the CFO is going to start looking harder and harder at those line items, and often a fixed investment, or new business terms with the provider, will start to make sense.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SaaS economics (or not?) <\/strong><br \/>\nWith payments, especially charged the way Square does, you only get paid when people actually use you- it\u2019s worse than regular SaaS. There are a number of great resources for SaaS business model economics on the web (see for example <a href=\"http:\/\/bostonvcblog.typepad.com\/vc\/2015\/10\/your-ltv-math-is-wrong.html\">Jeff Bussgang\u2019s work here<\/a>). Those businesses typically work or don\u2019t work based on how much a customer costs to acquire, and then how long they remain a paying customer. The problem for Square is that they only get paid when a customer actually uses the service (i.e. to accept payments). This is perhaps partially mitigated by their market leadership, which likely translates into better customer acquisition metrics, indeed they say <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1512673\/000119312515343733\/d937622ds1.htm\">half their customers<\/a> \u201cfind them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Is it all doom and gloom? There are some good signs, an increasing number of medium sized businesses are using Square, and the company is definitely still innovating with newer products (including IFTTT integration), and offerings like Square Capital (micro loans to businesses based on Square understand their business history, rather than traditional credit scoring techniques) are definitely interesting, as they use data from usage of the service to provide value, rather than attempting to sell something else. Perhaps the biggest question mark is how long we will be using credit cards for, and if that changes will Square be positioned to be part a newer way of paying?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Square\u2019s public market debut has put a focus how hard the payments business is, even for one of the apparent leaders.

Not having to see an abuser without having to block them, which could make them angry, is a valuable ability. Being able to hide new posts could help address the same issue.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond that, these new features also allow people to use Facebook without having to confront bittersweet memories about the time they spent with an ex. Sometimes it&#8217;s nice to think that an entire life can be catalogued on Facebook &#8212; other times it&#8217;s nice to be able to forget someone is no longer part of your life.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This work is part of our ongoing effort to develop resources for people who may be going through difficult moments in their lives,&#8221; Winters said in the blog post. &#8220;We hope these tools will help people end relationships on Facebook with greater ease, comfort and sense of control.&#8221; Most users will probably think that they do.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s not an application that plays Nickelback songs whenever you contact your ex, but new Facebook features could still make it easier&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611561,"featured_media":834014,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920789"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611561"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920789"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920789\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/834014"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920789"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920789"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920789"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":941020,"date":"2015-11-19T10:47:28","date_gmt":"2015-11-19T18:47:28","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/?p=248503"},"modified":"2015-11-19T10:47:28","modified_gmt":"2015-11-19T18:47:28","slug":"competitive-pressures-in-the-iot-software-market","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/19\/competitive-pressures-in-the-iot-software-market\/","title":{"rendered":"Competitive pressures in the IoT software market"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>I heard a story from an IoT software platform vendor recently about this year\u2019s IFA consumer electronics show in Berlin.<\/p>\n<p>At the show, an IBM guy walks up to him and says, hey Bob, did you know there are 163 IoT platforms now. Wow, that\u2019s a lot.<\/p>\n<p>Later in the day, an IHS analyst says to him, hey Bob, there are over 200 IoT platforms. Man, the number grew by dinner.<\/p>\n<p>Bob gets home and thinks, wow, it\u2019s getting really competitive out there. 200 platforms. Later that week, he\u2019s chatting with an investment banker and the topic arises. What does the banker say? Hey Bob, you know there are 300 IoT platform providers now.<\/p>\n<p>Clearly the number of IoT software platforms appears to be growing by the hour. Just ask Bob.<\/p>\n<p>So while the number probably isn&#8217;t growing by the day, it is growing. But\u00a0why is this happening? Well, the simple answer is that a lot of entrepreneurs and investors believe there\u2019s a lot of money to be made by networking the physical world. Everyone from IBM to two developers with a website are looking for business.<\/p>\n<p>They believe that all of these connected devices, 50 billion if you ask Cisco, will need software and that the device makers are unequipped to write that software, manage back end cloud services, design hardware modules, build APIs, or handle mobile integration. After all, whether you\u2019re Whirlpool or Staples, building out robust software platforms for connectivity isn\u2019t your corporate DNA.<\/p>\n<p>And the folks starting all these IoT platforms are largely right. The market opportunity is real and the pace of connectivity may encounter bumps as a lot of connectivity with little consumer ROI is introduced, but the long term trend is there. The question now is with so many platform providers wanting access to the market, how can they differentiate themselves. Or asked another way: So, Bob, when\u2019s the consolidation gonna start happening? (My best guess is in around 18-36 months when all the venture capital has been spent and VCs are only interested in providing latter stage funding to the platforms showing the most traction.)<\/p>\n<p>To answer the question about differentiation, the major factors for platform customers are price, time to market and security. Pricing wise, there\u2019s obvious downward pressure and I\u2019ve even heard that some platform providers might be trying to provide connectivity software free and attempting to monetize in other ways like through third party deals in industries like the utility sector.<\/p>\n<p>Though I also think what\u2019s happening is that the market is segmenting as certain premium brands gravitate towards the most robust and skilled platforms, which can still demand reasonable prices, while a lower market segment emerges that will provide basic connectivity\u00a0for\u00a0less expensive products that may not care about data, analytics, or to be honest, security.<\/p>\n<p>Time to market also will remain critical as the whole reason OEMs go to platform providers is to get them to market as soon as possible. If they wanted it to take a long time, they could do it themselves. In market segments like smart locks, security will remain absolutely crucial and customers will pay for the best. That\u2019ll be less true for products like wearables where the perceived security threat is lower. For platforms attempting to crack the security conscious markets, basic strategies like repeated third party audits will be standard operating procedure.<\/p>\n<p>In reality, it remains very early days for the IoT platform market. We\u2019re waiting to see how impactful a lot of outcomes from IoT will be. For example, how critical will connected product user data be\u00a0for\u00a0product designers in terms of iterating and making better products faster, or even through firmware updates? My belief is that in some scenarios, this will make a real difference. And if so, it will further drive connectivity due to accelerating the competitiveness that results from IoT.<\/p>\n<p>The trick for the current class of platform providers is to make it through the next 2-4 years so when the consolidation begins and the dust settles, they\u2019re there to provide platforms for that accelerating market.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I heard a story from an IoT software platform vendor recently about this year\u2019s IFA consumer electronics show in Berlin.

With that in mind, ticket search engine <a href=\"https:\/\/seatgeek.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">SeatGeek<\/a> is rolling out an update today that should make those ticket transactions less of a headache.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Until now SeatGeek has only dealt one-sided ticket sales, but starting today it&#8217;s dipping into the two-sided selling (aka direct ticket sales from SeatGeek users) with SeatGeek Marketplace, which is geared towards making it easier for individuals to find and\u00a0sell tickets. It&#8217;s not necessarily meant for someone looking to buy up a bunch of tickets and jack up prices for a profit. Intended to be a peer-to-peer network, the Marketplace is positioned to be a quick, simple alternative to the time-consuming and often messy processing of listing tickets on Facebook or Craigslist.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It works like this: after fans purchase tickets through SeatGeek, they&#8217;ll have the option to transfer tickets to friends via downloadable PDFs or sell tickets if they find themselves no longer able to attend.\u00a0Say you, for example, were smart enough to wake up early and hop on the Beyonc\u00e9 pre-sale and managed to snag tickets for yourself and two of your friends. With SeatGeek&#8217;s new features, you&#8217;ll be able to sell and transfer those tickets to your friends so they have their own tickets on their phones come day-of-show.\u00a0Direct ticket transfers are free, meaning that there are no fees tacked on if you sell and transfer tickets to friends directly.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Fans will also have the option to sell tickets publicly in the Marketplace in the event that they need to offload tickets. Using the tech behind SeatGeek&#8217;s DealScore algorithm (which essentially ranks available tickets based on the quality of the seat and price), sellers will get recommendations on listing prices to help them sell the ticket quickly and get the best price for it.\u00a0Tickets sold in the SeatGeek Marketplace will come at a 15 percent fee to the seller, but buyers won&#8217;t incur any additional fees beyond list price.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;The aim is creating a dead-simple, intuitive mobile ecosystem where people can buy and sell and transfer tickets,&#8221; says SeatGeek co-founder Jack Groetzinger.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The mobile part of that statement is key. The SeatGeek Marketplace is designed to be clean and easy to use, meaning that you don&#8217;t have to spend hours searching for the right ticket, deciphering fees and decoding transaction methods. You simply find the ticket you want, purchase either via the usual methods or through Venmo, and the seller transfers the PDF ticket to you, which you can pull up on your phone when entering the event.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Right now, StubHub offers a similar service, letting fans buy and sell tickets through its marketplace. Groetzinger tells me that SeatGeek&#8217;s real advantage is the simplicity and ease-of-use of the platform. With the DealScore algorithm and SeatGeek&#8217;s comprehensive interactive mapping feature (which helps buyers get a better idea of where their seats are located and what the venue looks like through photos), SeatGeek&#8217;s buying and selling experience is focused on fans who are looking for the best way to get the best seats for their budgets.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Whether you&#8217;re doing it via Facebook or Craigslist or your shady friend Greg who has a penchant for &#8220;small-scale capitalism,&#8221; buying\u00a0tickets to&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611562,"featured_media":920784,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[25248123,18248],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920782"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611562"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920782"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920782\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920784"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920782"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920782"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920782"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920775,"date":"2015-11-19T09:00:01","date_gmt":"2015-11-19T17:00:01","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920775"},"modified":"2015-11-19T07:38:41","modified_gmt":"2015-11-19T15:38:41","slug":"nuzzel-update-improves-news-discovery-for-those-that-dont-use-twitter","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/19\/nuzzel-update-improves-news-discovery-for-those-that-dont-use-twitter\/","title":{"rendered":"Nuzzel update improves news discovery for those who don&#8217;t use Twitter"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/nuzzel.com\/\">Nuzzel<\/a>, the content discovery service that collects and organizes links shared to Twitter and Facebook, is branching out with an update that will allow people to find stories related to their interests without having to connect to social networks. Now all they have to do is sign up for Nuzzel, follow a couple of feeds related to things they find interesting, and wait for the app to\u00a0do the rest.<\/p>\n<p>Nuzzel has risen in popularity over the past year because of its ability to sift through your social networks to find the most commonly shared links among those you follow or are friends with. You can also track the most shared news articles via\u00a0Twitter lists or other publicly available Twitter users&#8217; accounts. Many have said Nuzzel makes Twitter better, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/interview-with-nuzzel-ceo-jonathan-abrams-2015-6?op=1\">should be bought\u00a0by<\/a> that company.<\/p>\n<p>The update is being revealed\u00a0alongside\u00a0a new funding round with participation from executives at Mozilla, Google, and other companies. (The funding Nuzzel <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/09\/30\/social-news-curation-app-nuzzel-finds-backers-in-the-media-world\/\">shared in September<\/a>, which included contributions from executives at the Wall Street Journal, the Guardian, and others, is part of the round announced today.) Nuzzel raised $1.7 million in the round and a total of roughly $5.1 million to date.<\/p>\n<p>As for the update itself, Nuzzel users are likely to notice it right away. The app has been redesigned with a swipe-based navigation system that allows users to view their settings, their main feed, and other feeds they&#8217;ve decided to follow. Its search function has also been updated to look through stories and feeds, making it easier to find a specific article or blog post than it was in previous versions of the app.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Nuzzel_Discover.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-large wp-image-920776\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Nuzzel_Discover-452x804.png\" alt=\"Nuzzel_Discover\" width=\"452\" height=\"804\" data-attribution=\"Nuzzel\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Nuzzel_Discover-452x804.png 452w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Nuzzel_Discover-169x300.png 169w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Nuzzel_Discover-79x140.png 79w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Nuzzel_Discover-300x534.png 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Nuzzel_Discover-320x569.png 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Nuzzel_Discover-640x1138.png 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Nuzzel_Discover.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px\" \/><\/a>\n<p>But the biggest change is Nuzzel removing the requirement that people connect to at least one social account before they could use its service, as previously mentioned. That&#8217;s still an option &#8212; social network accounts that have already been linked to Nuzzel users will remain the same &#8212; but Nuzzel&#8217;s ability to attract new users is no longer dependent on those potential users having signed up for any other service.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The service will probably be still used the way it was before by people who login with Twitter.\u00a0 That core experience is not changing much,&#8221; Nuzzel founder and chief executive Jonathan Abrams told Gigaom. &#8220;But there will be a whole set of new users who couldn&#8217;t use Nuzzel before, and they will use it a bit [differently]\u00a0than the Twitter users, since their experience will involving finding relevant feeds instead of just seeing a &#8216;home&#8217; feed based on their own Twitter graph of who they follow.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Abrams said that he expects the feeds Nuzzel users will follow will be &#8220;created by influencers, experts, organizations, media companies, etc&#8221; in the future. But to kickstart the number of feeds available to users as part of this update, Nuzzel also &#8220;created a few hundred feeds&#8221; of its own. This ensures that people who don&#8217;t connect social accounts won&#8217;t struggle to find interesting things on the service.<\/p>\n<p>This update follows the release of <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/10\/28\/nuzzel-branches-into-content-creation-with-newsletter-platform\/\">a newsletter feature<\/a> that allows Nuzzel users to write short introductions to emails containing links surfaced by the service. At the time, Abrams explained that there are &#8220;probably hundreds of millions of people who would subscribe to an email newsletter but not install an app or have a Twitter account.&#8221; Nuzzel wants to appeal to that market instead of letting it lie.<\/p>\n<p>So how do newsletters fit with\u00a0Nuzzel&#8217;s update? &#8220;Nuzzel 2.0 and our newsletter product fit together to be part of our overall strategy to let everyone use Nuzzel, not just Twitter power users, and also become a platform for creating feeds and newsletters around any topic or community,&#8221; Abrams said. &#8220;Nuzzel 2.0 allows both web and app users to discover feeds or find them via search, and then subscribe&#8221; to the newsletters connected to those feeds via Nuzzel&#8217;s site and apps.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Nuzzel_Add_Favorite.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-large wp-image-920777\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Nuzzel_Add_Favorite-452x804.png\" alt=\"Nuzzel_Add_Favorite\" width=\"452\" height=\"804\" data-attribution=\"Nuzzel\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Nuzzel_Add_Favorite-452x804.png 452w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Nuzzel_Add_Favorite-169x300.png 169w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Nuzzel_Add_Favorite-79x140.png 79w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Nuzzel_Add_Favorite-300x534.png 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Nuzzel_Add_Favorite-320x569.png 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Nuzzel_Add_Favorite-640x1138.png 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Nuzzel_Add_Favorite.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px\" \/><\/a>\n<p>All together, these recent changes make Nuzzel much more palatable to a mainstream audience. The previous version of the app didn&#8217;t just require people to have a Twitter or Facebook account &#8212; it was also predicated on the idea that people were so overwhelmed by links shared to those networks\u00a0that they needed another service\u00a0to sort through them all. Those are a lot of barriers to entry.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Connecting with Twitter remains the best way to use Nuzzel, and still provides a great personalized news experience,&#8221; Abrams said. &#8220;But a lot of people don&#8217;t use Twitter, and Nuzzel 2.0 provides a new experience for those people, that also allows non-Twitter users to enjoy the power of social curation.&#8221; So it can still help quiet the cacophony of links shared to social networks, but now it could also appeal to people who have somehow managed to avoid the din of social media.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Nuzzel, the content discovery service that collects and organizes links shared to Twitter and Facebook, is branching out with an update that&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611561,"featured_media":920779,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920775"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611561"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920775"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920775\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920779"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920775"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920775"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920775"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":941021,"date":"2015-11-19T06:53:24","date_gmt":"2015-11-19T14:53:24","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/?p=248497"},"modified":"2015-11-19T06:53:24","modified_gmt":"2015-11-19T14:53:24","slug":"team-chat-apps-and-the-illusion-of-communication","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/19\/team-chat-apps-and-the-illusion-of-communication\/","title":{"rendered":"Team Chat Apps and the Illusion of Communication"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>This post was originally published at <a href=\"http:\/\/themodernteam.com\">The Modern Team&#8221;<\/a><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Chefs-in-Harmony.jpg\"><img src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Chefs-in-Harmony.jpg\" alt=\"Chefs-in-Harmony\" width=\"999\" height=\"747\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-248500\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThe single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2014George Bernard Shaw<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I once had a leadership role at a content factory.

Though we each had mastery over a certain part of the dish, we believed in everything we served. Our growing readership bolstered this belief.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But then Facebook changed its algorithm, and just like that a share on our page reached about 30% of what it used to reach.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And then we caught wind of how many articles other publishers were pumping out. Some remained at 20 per day. Others jumped to one article every 30 minutes. Still others had reached over 100 articles a day. \u201cIt\u2019s as though quality content doesn\u2019t matter anymore,\u201d one colleague told me. We had to act fast\u2014and though we didn\u2019t all agree on this\u2014we decided that keeping up with the Joneses was the only way to survive. More content.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Eventually a few of us got so overwhelmed just trying to maintain our small part that we lost sight of the dish, or that we were part of a team. We had turned into a bunch of individuals on autopilot, trusting that our team communication was solid because we were essentially doing the same job (just with different editorial sections), and because we had been doing it long enough to know we could trust each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As we were swamped with emails (I hit a point where I was receiving about 60 each day from colleagues, and over 100 from contributors), we tried to replace email as our primary team communication with a once-a-week phone call.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And so began our foray into the communication illusion. Rather than airing our concerns on our weekly call, we started privatizing them. Instead of helping a teammate understand an error they made (a photo wasn&#8217;t formatted properly, etc.), one of us would jump in and fix it without telling them. Who had the time? The machine had to be fed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I could see the quality of our content dropping, but it wasn\u2019t until joining the team here at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getflow.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Flow<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (and seeing what effective communication can look like) that I\u2019ve come to understand how our drop in quality was primarily a result of poor team communication.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"what-in-the-world-are-team-cha\" style=\"text-align: center\"><b>What In The World Are Team Chat Apps?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the interim between the content factory and Flow, I took on a variety of jobs. I was an adjunct instructor for universities on-the-ground and online, a freelance journalist covering international issues, and a public speaker. Not once during any of these gigs did I hear about \u201cproject management platforms\u201d or \u201cteam chat apps.\u201d And then I join Flow, and my first essay is titled <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/themodernteam.com\/work-email-is-dying-whats-next\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Work Email is Dying: What\u2019s Next?<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How the hell did that happen? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Because I saw the immense value a team communication tool can provide. Whereas I was receiving about 60 emails a day from colleagues, I\u2019m now receiving <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">maybe<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> 1. Whereas an email meant adding their email address, then a subject line, then an opening line and<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> then<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> what I wanted to say\u2014Flow allowed me to essentially skip those steps and get straight to the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">what I wanted to say<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> part. And whereas I wasn\u2019t sure where a conversation took place (or who was included on it), I could now jump into Flow chat and find exactly what I was looking for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, and although I am damn grateful for Jeremy Goldman of <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Inc.<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> referring to us as <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.inc.com\/jeremy-goldman\/here-s-what-might-make-email-obsolete-sooner-than-you-think.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What Might Make Email Obsolete<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, I have some reservations with team chat apps. Flow is a great product, and so are many other project management and team communication apps out there. But these tools are just that\u2026 tools. While they can and do help millions of people around the world work better together (I can\u2019t imagine not using one at this point), they can also present new communication illusions for teams.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"the-illusion-that-you-are-now-\" style=\"text-align: center\"><b>The Illusion That You Are Now Easier to Reach<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Chat apps have made communicating with your team easier. This can also mean they&#8217;ve made you easier to reach. Receiving an after-hours email isn\u2019t cool, but it also doesn\u2019t carry quite the same expectation of a reply the way a message in a team chat app does. In some apps, your teammates can see when you\u2019re on or when you\u2019ve viewed their message. In this way it\u2019s similar to a text message or even a Facebook direct message\u2014<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I saw you saw my message, why didn\u2019t you respond?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p>The tool, of course, isn\u2019t at fault here. To combat this, some have built-in features like away messages or \u201cout of work\u201d mode to let your colleagues know you\u2019re away. But the ultimate way to dismantle this illusion isn\u2019t to wield the tools of the app, it\u2019s to work on your team\u2019s workplace culture. This leads to:<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"the-illusion-that-your-team-ch\" style=\"text-align: center\"><b>The Illusion That Your Team Chat App = Your Team\u2019s Communication<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Reliance on team chat apps as the primary mode of communication can create the illusion that the app is synonymous with your team\u2019s communication. This illusion can more easily take hold if your team chat app also handles project management. But the complexity of team communication is vast, and no app can shore up existing and deeply-rooted team communication problems. If communication was terrible to begin with (as ours became at the content factory), then introducing an app may create the same effect\u2014teammates may gradually move from public chat to direct messages, and do so not for project management reasons but because of personal alliances.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"the-illusion-that-you-can-stop\" style=\"text-align: center\"><b>The Illusion That You Can Stop Organizing Your Thoughts<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It\u2019s easy to hate on internal work email (I did it when I found a better way), but email indirectly demands that the writer compose their thoughts before hitting send. Team chat apps, because they feel closer to WhatsApp or LINE than to email, can create the illusion that it\u2019s okay to send stream-of-consciousness unorganized chaos to your teammates. As Lauren Goode, senior editor at <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Verge<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, put it:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-i-know-its-cool-to-h16\" class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">I know it&#8217;s cool to hate on email but sometimes I wake up to 176 Slack notifications and think pls pls condense this into a coherent email<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Lauren Goode (@LaurenGoode) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LaurenGoode\/status\/636264527034646528\">August 25, 2015<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"the-illusion-that-you%e2%80%99\" style=\"text-align: center\"><b>The Illusion That You\u2019re Being Productive<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When I first started using Flow, I felt like I was most productive when I was logged in all day and up-to-date on everything everybody was chatting about. After a month or so I realized this was\u2026 an illusion. I am actually more productive when I\u2019m out walking and speaking my ideas into a voice memo, or sitting in the bathtub thinking about what topic to write about for TMT. And when I was logged in all the time I felt distracted when I was doing research in other tabs\u2014like I had to switch over to the Flow app in case I missed something. This broke my concentration, repeatedly, and actually made me less productive. In addition, this feeling of productivity led to me believing that I was portraying myself as a productive teammate (rather than letting the results speak for themselves). Of course it\u2019s important to have synchronous communication with your teammates, but there are far better ways to do this (through setting notifications or scheduling time) than through waiting for synchronicity to happen. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"the-illusion-that-your-team-ch2\" style=\"text-align: center\"><b>The Illusion That Your Team Chat App Will Be Embraced Evenly<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When communication started to break down at the content factory, certain teammates began to send text messages to those teammates they felt alliances with. That was the way some colleagues wanted to express what they were feeling. For me, because I didn\u2019t feel my voice mattered on our team-wide calls, a 1-1 call with a teammate who I knew respected my thoughts helped alleviate some of my struggles. Still others wanted to rant via email. So keep this in mind as you discover which team chat app works best for your team: <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Beyond the challenge of choosing, there is the challenge of using. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Teammates will embrace the app at different rates, and may use it in different ways. It\u2019s important to understand each teammate\u2019s communication preferences, and keep top of mind that the app is a tool and not <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the way<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"shaping-your-team%e2%80%99s-re\" style=\"text-align: center\"><b>Shaping Your Team\u2019s Recipe<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">David Gelb\u2019s documentary <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.magpictures.com\/jirodreamsofsushi\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Jiro Dreams of Sushi<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> explores the life and work of 85-year-old Jiro Ono, a sushi chef considered by many to be the greatest in the world. Ono\u2019s life schedule in Tokyo is and has always been like clockwork\u2014he gets the train at precisely the same minute each day, he arrives at work at precisely the same time, and he prepares each dish with the same rhythmic pattern he\u2019s been using since he started the craft. While the feature is of course on Ono, it\u2019s equally fascinating to watch the others with him in the kitchen. Their movements are just as flawless. The Japanese sushi tradition demands that chefs master each of the parts before they are able to deliver the whole dish. The result is a team that understands what each other is doing, consistently delivers a quality product and, underpinning it all, recognizes when and how to communicate with each other. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Your team\u2019s recipe will be different than any others, but your avoiding the illusions of communication along the way (whether you use a team chat app or not) will be what allows your team to reach its full potential.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What challenges have you had with team chat apps?

But with the launch of <a href=\"http:\/\/us.openlabs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Labs<\/a>&#8216; new Stagelight app on Android, that should get a bit better.<\/p>\n<p>Stagelight initially launched as a Windows\u00a0audio editing app that could be used by everyone from casual music makers to professionals, an alternative to GarageBand for those without a\u00a0Mac. It provides an easy\u00a0interface to create or mix tracks, and even offers\u00a0original sound libraries\u00a0(for a fee)\u00a0from popular artists such as Linkin Park and <a href=\"http:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2014\/02\/24\/now-you-can-jam-like-timbaland-thanks-to-open-labs-stagelight-app\/\" target=\"_blank\">Timbaland<\/a>, both of whom are part owners. You can import audio you&#8217;ve recorded and pretty quickly test different beats and sounds from those libraries within the Stagelight platform. Therefore, the move to Android was a natural next step that was previously held back by the last few versions of\u00a0the OS not being ideal for recording, according to Open Labs founder Cliff Mountain.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When we first started testing Stagelight on Android we realized there was 0.5\u00a0to 2 seconds of latency on some devices,&#8221; Mountain told me. &#8220;If you can imagine trying to tap out a beat, you couldn&#8217;t tap and keep up in time because the output latency would throw you off.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In simpler terms, it would be like trying to learn an entirely new song with a band whose individual members were between one and\u00a0two\u00a0seconds behind what you were playing. But with\u00a0release of Android Marshmallow,\u00a0that isn&#8217;t the case. Open Labs worked with both Google and Intel to fine tune Stagelight&#8217;s ability to perform on par with\u00a0other pro audio editing apps.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_920757\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Stagelight-builder.png\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-920757\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Stagelight-builder-300x190.png\" alt=\"A list of all the lessons Stagelight offers for people that aren't familiar with making their own tracks.\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" data-attribution=\"Open Labs\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Stagelight-builder-300x190.png 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Stagelight-builder-804x509.png 804w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Stagelight-builder-968x613.png 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Stagelight-builder-210x133.png 210w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Stagelight-builder-320x203.png 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Stagelight-builder-640x405.png 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Stagelight-builder.png 1257w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A list of all the lessons Stagelight offers for people that aren&#8217;t familiar with making their own tracks.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>The Stagelight Android app, which <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.openlabs.stagelight&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">launches today<\/a>, is initially available as a free download, much\u00a0like its Windows application.

(If I didn&#8217;t hate the &#8220;X for Y&#8221; construction so much I&#8217;d compare this new feature to a &#8220;Kickstarter for charities,&#8221; but I do so I won&#8217;t.)<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/fundraiser-on-mobile-and-shared-with-friends-v4.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-920772\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/fundraiser-on-mobile-and-shared-with-friends-v4-804x790.png\" alt=\"fundraiser-on-mobile-and-shared-with-friends-v4\" width=\"804\" height=\"790\" data-attribution=\"Facebook\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/fundraiser-on-mobile-and-shared-with-friends-v4-804x790.png 804w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/fundraiser-on-mobile-and-shared-with-friends-v4-300x295.png 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/fundraiser-on-mobile-and-shared-with-friends-v4-968x952.png 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/fundraiser-on-mobile-and-shared-with-friends-v4-142x140.png 142w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/fundraiser-on-mobile-and-shared-with-friends-v4-48x48.png 48w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/fundraiser-on-mobile-and-shared-with-friends-v4-320x315.png 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/fundraiser-on-mobile-and-shared-with-friends-v4-640x629.png 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/fundraiser-on-mobile-and-shared-with-friends-v4.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 804px) 100vw, 804px\" \/><\/a>\n<p>The second feature isn&#8217;t as novel. Facebook tested a &#8220;donate&#8221; button with more than 20 nonprofit organizations in December 2013. That button could be added to the bottom of posts and stories, and <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.fb.com\/news\/2015\/11\/introducing-new-tools-for-nonprofits\/\">now it&#8217;s back<\/a> in the same form. &#8220;Including a Donate button on a post will give people an easy way to donate directly from News Feed,&#8221; Facebook product management VP Naomi Klein said.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook will now let nonprofit organizations display a donate button on their pages, right underneath their profile picture. This will give them\u00a0a\u00a0&#8220;consistent place to collect donations, even as they update their Page\u2019s content,&#8221; Klein said. It will also make it hard for anyone to claim that they looked\u00a0at a group&#8217;s Facebook page but couldn&#8217;t figure out how they could make a donation to the organization.<\/p>\n<p>The company said it&#8217;s working with groups like the World Wildlife Fund and National Multiple Sclerosis Society to test the new features, and plans to expand it to other\u00a0United States-based 501c3 nonprofits in the future. It thanked 37 organizations, from Alzheimer&#8217;s Association to Wounded Warrior Project, for helping it &#8220;shape new ways to help people come together and make a difference.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook has introduced new features\u00a0today that will make it easier for nonprofit organizations to raise funds for specific causes and receive general&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611561,"featured_media":920773,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359218214,111421],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920771"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611561"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920771"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920771\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920773"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920771"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920771"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920771"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":941022,"date":"2015-11-18T09:05:45","date_gmt":"2015-11-18T17:05:45","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/?p=248494"},"modified":"2015-11-18T09:05:45","modified_gmt":"2015-11-18T17:05:45","slug":"citrix-to-spin-out-goto-products-will-cut-investment-in-podio","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/18\/citrix-to-spin-out-goto-products-will-cut-investment-in-podio\/","title":{"rendered":"Citrix to spin out Goto products, will cut &#8216;investment&#8217; in Podio"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Citrix has announced that the Goto family of products is being spun out, as part of a refocusing the company on\u00a0its core capabilities.

The two companies are also jointly offering a special promotion to new customers who are looking to use both systems.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"jive-has-other-existing-conten\" ><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Jive Has Other Existing Content Management Integrations<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>This is not the first integration that Jive has done with a third-party content management vendor. Jive has had long-standing integrations with Alfresco, Box, Google Drive, and Microsoft (Office, Office 365 and Outlook). The Google and Microsoft integrations were built by Jive, without official partnerships being formed.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The joint Alfresco-Jive solution was launched in 2012 and used CMIS to sync documents and content actions between the two systems. Interestingly, Alfresco has a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.alfresco.com\/jive\" target=\"_blank\">webpage<\/a> describing the integration<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0and still lists Jive as a Technology Partner, while Jive no longer acknowledges Alfresco as an official partner on its website.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Finally, Jive still has an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jivesoftware.com\/partners\/company\/box\/\" target=\"_blank\">active technology partnership with Box<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Like the Egnyte integration, Jive and Box have built a bi-directional sync that pushes changes made in one system to the other.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 id=\"potential-reasons-why-jive-add\" ><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Potential Reasons Why Jive Added Another Content Management Partner<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While I have not yet spoken with anyone from either Jive or Egnyte, I can lay out some possible explanations for why they partnered and integrated their offerings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">First, the integration may have been done simply because a large number of mutual customers asked for it. That is not an unusual situation in enterprise software, and both Jive and Egnyte listen and respond well to their customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This partnership and technology integration may have been proposed and largely built by Egnyte, who is facing stiff competition, as well as feature and price commoditization, in the EFSS market. Partnering with Jive creates a competitive advantage for Egnyte over rivals such as Accellion, Citrix ShareFile, Syncplicity, and others. The comparative quality and depth of the press releases from the two partners suggests that Egynte may well have had the lead here. That impression is underscored by that fact that Egnyte created and published the video demonstration embedded above.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A final, possible explanation is that Jive is looking for an alternative partner to Box, which has moved up the food chain by forming deep technology and go-to-market partnerships with Apple, IBM, and Microsoft. Perhaps Box is now more focused on helping its customers integrate with IBM Connections and Microsoft SharePoint and Office 365 instead of Jive. As a result, Jive would need a more active partner, which it may have found in Egnyte. Another consideration is that Box is a cloud-only service, while Jive&#8217;s partnership with Egnyte\u00a0enables cloud, on-premises, and hybrid joint deployments.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 id=\"takeaways\" ><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Takeaways<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Regardless of the reason(s) for the Jive-Egnyte partnership, it represents a win for their mutual customers, who now have a pre-built integration that enables secure, mobile-friendly content storage, discovery, sharing, and collaboration. This partnership could also have upside for the two vendors, if they can work with the other\u2019s existing customers to sell their own offerings.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This deal also has implications for the collaboration and EFSS market segments. If nothing else, it underscores that the line between the two, which was already quite blurry, is in fact disappearing. Pure-play EFSS vendors, in particular, will have a difficult time sustaining their existing business, much less grow it, as file services continue to be pushed into collaboration platforms. Their last hope to remain independent may rest on the growing uptake of containerized, microservices enterprise computing architectures, in which they can provide cutting edge file services.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Enterprise collaboration software provider Jive Software and Egnyte, an enterprise file sync and share vendor, have formed a new partnership and technology&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87625438,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[290,140198,15328,11929,8611,359235176,4597,28416,54791,359215905],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/941023"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87625438"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=941023"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/941023\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=941023"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=941023"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=941023"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920770,"date":"2015-11-18T08:05:04","date_gmt":"2015-11-18T16:05:04","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920770"},"modified":"2015-11-18T08:48:53","modified_gmt":"2015-11-18T16:48:53","slug":"facebook-activates-safety-check-after-nigeria-bombing","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/18\/facebook-activates-safety-check-after-nigeria-bombing\/","title":{"rendered":"Facebook activates Safety Check after Nigeria bombing"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-africa-34855698\">activated its Safety Check<\/a> feature in response to a market bombing in Nigeria that killed at least 32 people and wounded dozens of other bystanders.<\/p>\n<p>Safety Check was originally meant to be used\u00a0in the wake of natural disasters like earthquakes and hurricanes.

But in an increasingly crowded market with multiple tools\u00a0promising to declutter websites, new ad-blockers need a schtick to differentiate themselves from the competition.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/goodblock.org\/\">Goodblock<\/a>, an extension available as a public beta, is one of those newcomers. It performs\u00a0the standard function of blocking ads &#8212; that&#8217;s in the job description &#8212; but it also gives users the option of periodically viewing advertisements that give at least 30 percent of their revenues back to the charitable cause of their choice.<\/p>\n<p>The actual mechanisms, which involve what the company behind Goodblock calls an &#8220;ambassador butterfly&#8221; named Tad as well as\u00a0using virtual hearts as currency, is a little more complicated but that&#8217;s the gist of the extension. It&#8217;s available now\u00a0for Google Chrome, and it will expand to Mozilla&#8217;s Firefox and Apple&#8217;s Safari soon.<\/p>\n<p>The ads themselves are static images that will take up an entire browser screen. Users can decide not to view the ads &#8212; just leave the ambassador butterfly alone! &#8212; and Goodblock will continue to block all the ads that would otherwise appear. Gladly, the company behind the app, has basically built a guilt-free ad-blocker.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The growing usage of ad blockers is a signal that people want more control over their online ad experience. Advertisers need a better solution; simply finding workarounds to ad blockers or forcing users to pay for content isn\u2019t a long term fix,&#8221; said Gladly chief executive Alex Groth. &#8220;Goodblock represents a radically new model for ad blocking that gives users control over the ads they engage with, and a choice in how the revenue they help earn is allocated. We want people to not only enjoy the ads they choose to see, but to feel good that their time is also helping out a good cause.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Goodblock is an extension of what Gladly has done with &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.tabforacause.org\/\">Tab for a Cause,<\/a>&#8221; a tool which replaces the browser&#8217;s &#8220;New Tab&#8221; page with advertisements that support a charitable organization.

This didn&#8217;t prove enough to help the social network take on Facebook and Twitter, however, so the company <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/10\/20\/google-photos-reaches-100m-users-in-five-months\/\">spun out the best aspect<\/a> of Google+ and has now apparently rethought the site.<\/p>\n<p>Google &#8220;director of streams&#8221; (whatever that means) Eddie Kessler said in a blog post Google+ is focusing on communities and collections based on user feedback. \u00a0These are &#8220;the places on Google+ where people around the world are spending their time discovering and sharing things they love,&#8221; Kessler said in his blog post.<\/p>\n<p>The new Google+ is supposed to be available now, but I was unable to opt-in to the updated service using the methods described <a href=\"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/+LukeWroblewski\/posts\/jJvNS3mwxyv\">in this post<\/a>. From what Google has said, however, it seems like the company is changing Google+ into a Reddit competitor instead of an attempt to take on other social networking services.<\/p>\n<p>Google+ could have the benefit of being connected to people&#8217;s Gmail accounts. My real name and face appear whenever I post something on the service; when I post to Reddit, though, I can use any pseudonym I like without restriction. This could make Google+ seem like a friendlier, decentralized version of <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/06\/10\/reddit-censorship-ban\/\">its controversial competitor<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But, then, pseudonymity is one of the nice things about Reddit. (You can pry my throwaway account from my cold, dead fingers.) Perhaps the two sites won&#8217;t compete so much as they&#8217;ll coexist by focusing on different audiences. Until the new Google+ is\u00a0widely available it all comes down to little more than guesswork.<\/p>\n<p>People should be able to test the updated Google+ website now.

Though Vessyl has run into delays in product launch, Mark One is moving forward with Pryme Vessyl: a hydration-focused addition to the Vessyl line.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Pryme is something of a slimmed-down, lithe and market-ready version of Vessyl. Though it doesn&#8217;t specialize in molecular analysis like Vessyl, Pryme is an intelligent cup that uses some seriously sophisticated sensor tech and what it calls the Pryme algorithm to track your water intake to help you reach your prime (get it?).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Pryme&#8217;s reason for existing is pretty straightforward: You don&#8217;t drink enough water.\u00a0At the end of the day, when you finally slow down and sit down and step away from your screens and devices, you probably realize that you forgot to drink much at all. You&#8217;ve got a headache, but all you want to do is head to bed and you certainly don&#8217;t want to catch up on a day&#8217;s worth of water now and pay for it all night long.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It&#8217;s difficult to overstate the importance of hydration. Naturally, we all understand how vitally important water is in the context of extreme situations, but it can be a bit more difficult to remember to stay hydrated when you&#8217;re in the office that your boss keep just a <i>tad <\/i>too cold than it is when you&#8217;re outside in the brutal midst of summer when even the air seems to be at least thirty percent sweat. Water is key to keeping our brains and bodies working optimally. Without it, things start to go downhill pretty quickly.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-Stretchedit.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-920754 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-Stretchedit-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Pryme Stretch\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" data-attribution=\"Mark One\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-Stretchedit-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-Stretchedit-210x140.jpg 210w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-Stretchedit-804x536.jpg 804w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-Stretchedit-968x646.jpg 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-Stretchedit-205x137.jpg 205w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-Stretchedit-175x117.jpg 175w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-Stretchedit-320x213.jpg 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-Stretchedit-640x427.jpg 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-Stretchedit.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;We&#8217;re showing links to decrease in focus, decrease in attention, even short-term memory deficits around even minimal levels of dehydration,&#8221; says Dr. Hanson Lenyoun as we discuss the studies and vast amounts of research that surround hydration. &#8220;We tend to forget that water is so vital for life and for every function of our body that it impacts everything.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To be clear, though, not everyone&#8217;s &#8220;day&#8217;s worth of water&#8221; is the oft-fabled eight glasses. As Mark One&#8217;s Head of Brand Nic Barnes tells me, it&#8217;d be pretty crazy to assume that LeBron James and Miley Cyrus require the same amount of water daily. Taking into account physical factors like your age, weight and biological sex, along with your level of activity, the Pryme algorithm determines how much water you need to suit your hydration needs.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;Hydration is something that&#8217;s unique to each person,&#8221; says Barnes, &#8220;but we also know that hydration is dynamic, meaning if you wake up at 6 a.m. on a Monday and you work out and you wake up at 6 a.m. on a Tuesday and you don&#8217;t work out, what you need to drink at 7 a.m. is very different. The body fluctuates and the body&#8217;s needs fluctuate throughout the day.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-in-Handedit.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-920752 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-in-Handedit-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Pryme in Hand\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-in-Handedit-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-in-Handedit-210x140.jpg 210w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-in-Handedit-804x536.jpg 804w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-in-Handedit-968x646.jpg 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-in-Handedit-205x137.jpg 205w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-in-Handedit-175x117.jpg 175w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-in-Handedit-320x213.jpg 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-in-Handedit-640x427.jpg 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-in-Handedit.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">At first glance, Vessyl and Pryme are pretty similar. Aesthetically, it&#8217;s dead-simple. It&#8217;s all clean lines and uninterrupted flow. All of Pryme&#8217;s tech is cleverly concealed between the Tritan exterior and the glass walls of the cup&#8217;s interior. The lid is magnetic and moves organically, sans unwieldy straws or squeaky caps. And the Pryme&#8217;s distinguishing feature, the an illuminated that rises and falls with your hydration levels, acting as a guide as you move toward peak hydration.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">With sensors inside of the cup, Pryme tracks the amount of water that passes through its 16 oz. frame. The info gathered through the Pryme app and its integration with Apple Health, Apple Watch and Jawbone&#8217;s UP wearable fitness trackers impacts a real-time assessment of your dynamic hydration needs. With push notifications and the aforementioned light, Pryme lets you know how close you are to your &#8220;Pryme&#8221;. When you get there, a barely-there blue light appears, letting you know you&#8217;ve reached the bare minimum human being requirement for the day.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/App-PrymeTimeedit.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-920755 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/App-PrymeTimeedit-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"App PrymeTime\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" data-attribution=\"Mark One\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/App-PrymeTimeedit-300x168.jpg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/App-PrymeTimeedit-804x450.jpg 804w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/App-PrymeTimeedit-968x542.jpg 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/App-PrymeTimeedit-210x118.jpg 210w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/App-PrymeTimeedit-1500x840.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/App-PrymeTimeedit-320x179.jpg 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/App-PrymeTimeedit-640x359.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;From a design perspective, it&#8217;s critical that we make sure that people, when they experience the product, feel like it&#8217;s an extension of them and not just a gadget or some kind of utility,&#8221; says Barnes.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Though Vessyl, Pryme Vessyl&#8217;s predecessor, ran into delays that have held up production and shipping, Pryme is an extension of the Vessyl line of thinking and is available for the first time today online and in Apple Retail Stores.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">While not intended to be a replacement for Vessyl &#8212; which is designed to analyze and track beverages inside of it (from beer to coffee and water to cider) &#8212; Pryme is a piece of the Vessyl puzzle, and it&#8217;ll be making its way to early backers who placed preorders as a &#8220;thank you&#8221; for being patient whilst Vessyl continues to move towards release. Pryme isn&#8217;t Vessyl-lite, though &#8212; it&#8217;s meant to stand on its own, taking the Mark One core value of empowering people to make healthier choices and pointing it in a new direction.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-on-Deskedit.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-920753 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-on-Deskedit-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Pryme on Desk\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" data-attribution=\"Mark One\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-on-Deskedit-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-on-Deskedit-210x140.jpg 210w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-on-Deskedit-804x536.jpg 804w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-on-Deskedit-968x646.jpg 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-on-Deskedit-205x137.jpg 205w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-on-Deskedit-175x117.jpg 175w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-on-Deskedit-320x213.jpg 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-on-Deskedit-640x427.jpg 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Pryme-on-Deskedit.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Some will be quick to write it off, calling it a very expensive water bottle. At $99, they&#8217;d technically be right, but Pryme&#8217;s role in your life goes pretty far beyond cup holders and the bottom of your gym bag.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Its gentle nudges and small reminders come together to mean fewer headaches, better focus and less grumpiness at the hands of dehydration. It&#8217;s the kind of tech that&#8217;s deeply personal and that has the ability to impact daily behaviors, but begs you not to over think it. Underneath the Apple-esque curves and decidedly 21st century wireless charging tech (which nets Pryme Vessyl about two days of battery life on a two-hour charge), it&#8217;s still something we&#8217;ve been using for centuries: a cup. It&#8217;s just smarter now, like everything else we use.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Update: An earlier version of this story stated that the original Vessyl campaign was a Kickstarter.

Using adaptive and micro learning principles, paired with ramification and on-demand knowledge centers, Axonify&#8217;s employee knowledge platform is a serious departure from the training systems that are in place at most companies today.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;<\/span>Axonify&#8217;s approach was born of the simple realization that human beings aren&#8217;t capable of effectively acquiring large volumes of knowledge in one long event,&#8221; says Carol Leaman, CEO of Axonify. &#8220;Attention spans are short and getting shorter.\u00a0 We&#8217;re stressed and distracted.\u00a0 We also have very individual and specific\u00a0\u00a0information needs.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">It shouldn&#8217;t come as much of a surprise that we&#8217;re not great a focusing. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and a hundred other sources of #content demand our attention hourly. And it doesn&#8217;t help that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2015\/11\/kill-email-die-email\/415419\/\">we check our email on average 77 times per day<\/a>. We&#8217;re bombarded by information constantly, and when it&#8217;s more than a few sentences, we&#8217;re not great at filing it away for future use.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">&#8220;<\/span>Our brains are really good at digesting 4 to 5 new pieces of information at a time and moving them from short to long-term memory,&#8221; says Leaman. &#8220;It turns out we&#8217;re easily overwhelmed, and too much content literally goes &#8216;in one ear and out the other&#8217;. It also turns out that in order to hone that knowledge, we need to actively recall the information periodically over 30 &#8211; 45 days.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">That&#8217;s where the micro learning aspect of Axonify comes in. Information specific to an employees position within a company is doled out in small, digestible segments. Sessions don&#8217;t last hours, but minutes, and gamifies the learning process with points and leader boards.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">&#8220;Employees spend about 3 to 5 minutes per day on the platform receiving content in a micro learning format,&#8221; says Leaman. &#8220;Through understanding leading edge brain-based research in the areas of memory and retention, we designed the experience to create the most optimal scenario for knowledge acquisition that delivers targeted information, person by person, based on what they know, or don&#8217;t know, every single day. The proprietary algorithm we\u2019ve developed allows us to personalize learning according to individual needs, strengths and weaknesses.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Employees voluntarily engaging with content that makes them better at their jobs is a powerful thing. But what kind of knowledge and content are we talking about?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Right now, Axonify&#8217;s being used by companies like Walmart, Toyota, Bloomingdale&#8217;s and John Hancock. All wildly different companies in vastly different industries. Customer service, sales and product knowledge are obvious bets for the Axonify platform, but a vital piece of the employee knowledge is one that companies can&#8217;t afford to overlook: safety.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">&#8220;Walmart is using Axonify across its more than 75,000 distribution centre associates to keep them safe on the job,&#8221; says Leaman. &#8220;OSHA reportable incidents dropped by 54% in the first six months. The amount of money saved was incredible.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Axonify goes a bit further than just training, though. Understanding that question don&#8217;t always crop up at convenient times and aren&#8217;t always answered by bite-sized morsels of information, Axonify is rolling out Discovery Zone, which provides easily-accessible reference material.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">&#8220;It&#8217;s a place where employees can easily find whatever they need to do their jobs in 2 clicks and 10 seconds,&#8221; says Leaman. &#8220;With so much information in most corporate archives, employees can&#8217;t find anything quickly. They need to have information at their fingertips, on-demand, instantly.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Axonify-screenshot-11.16.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-920747 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Axonify-screenshot-11.16-300x271.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"271\" data-attribution=\"Axonify\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Axonify-screenshot-11.16-300x271.jpg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Axonify-screenshot-11.16-804x727.jpg 804w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Axonify-screenshot-11.16-968x876.jpg 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Axonify-screenshot-11.16-155x140.jpg 155w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Axonify-screenshot-11.16-1500x1357.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Axonify-screenshot-11.16-320x290.jpg 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Axonify-screenshot-11.16-640x579.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\">Shaking up the way that employers and employees interact as they circle around important on-the-job information is a tall order, to be sure. Companies, particularly large ones, are notoriously slow to adopt new technology. That said, with large companies already on board, there&#8217;s an obvious benefit to shirking the old training system and plugging into the next generation of delivering employee knowledge.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">&#8220;Employees feel the intrinsic benefit of being smarter, and they appreciate being given the opportunity to learn constantly, quickly, specifically and when they have a few spare minutes,&#8221; says Leaman. &#8220;All this translates into higher employee engagement that benefits the business as a whole.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Employee training is usually a profoundly unhelpful whirlwind.

It was the first time Facebook made the feature, Safety Check, available in response to a terror attack instead of an earthquake or similar event.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook said in an email that more than\u00a04 million people used Safety Check after the Paris attack, and that 360 million people received notifications about the status of a friend or family member. That&#8217;s more than other disasters, like recent earthquakes in Afghanistan and Chile, but less than the earthquakes that struck Nepal in April and May. Safety Check, it turns out, is popular in a crisis.<\/p>\n<p>The episode highlighted Facebook&#8217;s utility in a disaster.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Facebook is clearly a place people expect to see frequent updates from their friends, and given Facebook&#8217;s penetration in some of its biggest markets, it&#8217;s also going to be a place where the vast majority of your friends have accounts,&#8221; said Jackdaw Research chief analyst Jan Dawson. &#8220;So it&#8217;s a logical place for people to go to see if their friends are OK after a disaster (whether man-made or otherwise), and it&#8217;s also logical for Facebook to make that checkin process as easy as possible.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But the reaction to Safety Check wasn&#8217;t all positive. Critics were <a href=\"http:\/\/fusion.net\/story\/233218\/beirut-paris-kenya-media\/\">quick to point out<\/a> that Facebook made the feature available in response to the Paris attack, but it didn&#8217;t do so\u00a0for\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/11\/16\/world\/middleeast\/beirut-lebanon-attacks-paris.html?_r=0\">a double suicide attack<\/a> in Beirut, Lebanon the day before. Some <a href=\"http:\/\/www.buildwith.org\/on-technology-and-bias-why-we-dont-have-a-facebook-safety-check-for-beirut\/\">blamed this on<\/a> the inherent biases of Facebook&#8217;s engineers; Facebook vice president of growth Alex Schultz <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/fbsafety\/posts\/930229667014872\">said it was<\/a> because Safety Check is still young.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This activation will change our policy around Safety Check and when we activate it for other serious and tragic incidents in the future. We want this tool to be available whenever and wherever it can help,&#8221; Schultz said in a blog post. &#8220;We will learn a lot from feedback on this launch, and we&#8217;ll also continue to explore how we can help people show support for the things they care about through their Facebook profiles, which we did in the case for Paris, too.&#8221; Safety Check could become the go-to utility whenever disaster strikes around the world.<\/p>\n<p>That would inevitably bring even more criticism. Facebook thrives because its users think it&#8217;s indispensable. They use the service to message friends, share pictures, and share their opinions on whatever happens to be in the news cycle. For some people it&#8217;s hard to imagine life without Facebook &#8212; but the truth is that most of the service&#8217;s users would be able to replace the network if needed.<\/p>\n<p>People know this. It&#8217;s why they pretend to freak out whenever Facebook goes down. If they were actually concerned it wouldn&#8217;t seem like a joke; it would be a crippling failure of a critical system. Facebook reaps the benefits of people thinking they need to use its service without often being held to the same standards applied to systems that people actually consider a basic need.<\/p>\n<p>The response to Safety Check brought this truth into stark relief. The moment people thought they might have needed Facebook &#8212; in this case to share that they were safe following the attack in Beirut &#8212; they demanded to know why it seemed to care more about an attack in France than an attack in Lebanon. No good deed (or in this case disaster-focused feature) seems to go unpunished.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook\u00a0&#8220;appears to be trying to help out and are responding to user feedback but their good will in this situation may not be received in the way they intended,&#8221; said Gartner analyst Brian Blau. &#8220;I don\u2019t see their safety check as trying to replace official government efforts to help those impacted by the tragedy, but in [an] awkward way people are assuming their efforts to [be] nefarious in nature, and I just don\u2019t think that is the case.\u00a0I\u2019m sure they feel some responsibility to help their users communicate given they are\u00a0so popular globally.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The company is caught between triviality and indispensability. People need to think it&#8217;s integral to their lives for Facebook to continue to thrive, but in cases when the service is actually viewed as more than just a social networking tool, the company often invites criticism. (Just look to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eff.org\/deeplinks\/2015\/10\/global-coalition-facebook-authentic-names-are-authentically-dangerous-your-users\">the campaign<\/a> for the company to change its real-name policy for evidence this isn&#8217;t confined to Safety Check.)<\/p>\n<p>Given how many people used Safety Check the night of the Paris attack, it&#8217;s clear that they view the feature as an important way to communicate with the people they care about in a tragedy. Facebook seems to understand this, and is taking the criticism about not using Safety Check during other terror attacks seriously. But there&#8217;s sure to be more complaints &#8212; that&#8217;s what happens when more than a billion people use a service, and several million actually need it in their lives.<\/p>\n<p>Safety Check made sure Facebook is finally indispensable. Now the company will have to learn how to manage all the expectations that come from that new status.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook has an indispensability problem:\u00a0Whenever people discover a feature they feel as if they can&#8217;t live without, the company is immediately scrutinized&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611561,"featured_media":910666,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359218214,359234159],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920739"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611561"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920739"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920739\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/910666"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920739"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920739"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920739"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920741,"date":"2015-11-16T13:21:53","date_gmt":"2015-11-16T21:21:53","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920741"},"modified":"2015-11-16T14:04:09","modified_gmt":"2015-11-16T22:04:09","slug":"pandora-acquires-rdio-for-75m-in-cash","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/16\/pandora-acquires-rdio-for-75m-in-cash\/","title":{"rendered":"Pandora acquires Rdio for $75M in cash"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Pandora has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20151116006169\/en\/Pandora-Acquire-Key-Assets-Rdio\">agreed to acquire key assets<\/a> from Rdio, a streaming music service that competes with Spotify and similar products, for roughly $75 million in cash.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s more than $50 million less than Rdio raised across six rounds of venture financing, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/rdio#\/entity\">according to Crunchbase<\/a>.

As such, buying the assets allow Pandora to move quicker, he added.<\/p>\n<p>The deal is a further sign of consolidation in the music streaming market. Apple spent $3 billion on Beats last year, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.esquire.com\/entertainment\/music\/a39741\/apple-shuts-down-beats-music\/\">is shutting down<\/a> the Beats Music service at the end of the month.

Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Prime Music, Google Play Music, Deezer, Tidal, and other services will continue to vie for attention in this oversaturated space.<\/p>\n<p>This is the second major acquisition for Pandora in the last few months, with the first being a $450 million purchase of ticketing business <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20151007005517\/en\/Pandora-Acquire-Ticketfly-Create-World%E2%80%99s-Powerful-Music#.VhUMrxNVhBd\" target=\"_blank\">Ticketfly<\/a>.

Tablets can open an entirely new world to kids, but the rise of tablet play has inevitably led a decline in the amount of time kids spend making their own fun, which is a crucial part of childhood development.\u00a0There&#8217;s a litany of apps that limit screen time in an effort to get kids to unplug and interact with the &#8220;real world&#8221;, but one startup is taking a different approach and attempting to bridge the gap between digital and imaginative play.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The basic idea behind <a href=\"http:\/\/popupplaytoy.com\/\">PopUp Play<\/a> is\u00a0that one of the greatest &#8220;toys&#8221; a kid can have is a giant cardboard box and an imagination, thus transforming a refrigerator box into a castle or spaceship. But recognizing that in today&#8217;s world, more playtime on the tablet is translating to less time spent interacting with the world in the jovial, imaginative way that kids are wont to do, Amelia Cosgrove and Bryan Thomas dreamt up PopUp Play, an Austin-based startup that brings tablet play into the real world with cardboard &#8220;playscapes&#8221; &#8212; sturdy cardboard castles that are designed by children via a tablet app.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As a kid, Cosgrove spent a lot of time in cardboard boxes. Co-founder Thomas tells me how their startup started with a conversation over lunch with colleagues during which Cosgrove recounted her experience as a kid, playing in a boxes that became rocket ships and pieces of imagined worlds.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;PopUp Play is this blend between offline, imaginative play and online play,&#8221; says Thomas. &#8220;Kids start in the PopUp Play Build Lab, which is a 3D design tool for kids, and they design their own custom Playscape &#8211;like a castle, a gingerbread house or a rocket ship &#8212; and then push a button, and a few days later, we deliver the design to their door, exactly as they designed it in the app. So, they&#8217;re literally designing a physical structure in the app that we make and deliver to their house, and they get to play inside.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">PopUp Play starts with letting kids create and design custom Playscapes on its Build Lab app and then gives them the experience of seeing something they designed appear at their doors.\u00a0Made from rugged, play-tested cardboard, they assemble in a few minutes and can be quickly dismantled and stored flat until playtime comes round again.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Starting from basic frameworks, kids can customize their Playscapes with structural components like drawbridges, towers, and windows, along with design elements like a custom coat of arms or decals of dragons, torches and unicorns.\u00a0The Build Lab itself is a kid-friendly 3D design program that gives kids a little bit of guidance and a lot of freedom as they create.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;The only thing that&#8217;s fixed on the castle is that it has to have four walls. Beyond that, kids can add windows, towers, doors anywhere they want them. And then we provide a little bit of gentle guidance in the app to help them make decisions with respect to the design itself,&#8221; says Thomas.\u00a0&#8220;For some of these younger kids, the app has what we call gentle nudges to help them make good decisions about where to put structural components so that the structure actually stands up.

What&#8217;s more, playscapes are a flat price of $99 plus $10 for shipping, meaning that whether a kid opts for a simple-but-elegant castle or one that&#8217;s got three towers, five windows and a drawbridge, the price is the same.\u00a0Much unlike the many children&#8217;s apps that allow kids to rack up hefty bills with in-app purchases (like the ones that Kanye publicly denounced just a few weeks ago), PopUp Play isn&#8217;t looking to limit kids by putting a premium on creatively-designed structures.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;We really wanted kids to feel like they had full breadth of creativity without any incremental costs or repercussions,&#8221; says Thomas, &#8220;because that&#8217;s just lame.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">While the $99 price point might seem a bit high when the alternative is a refrigerator box and a set of markers, the startup believes the educational aspects of the playscapes will provide justification. Though kids have an embarrassment of riches when it comes to cool toys, there isn&#8217;t much opportunity for them to translate a learning experience into a large physical structure that&#8217;s meant for play. PopUp Play&#8217;s playscapes present something of a new creative opportunity for kids that comes to life in a big way.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/IMG_9911.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all\"><img class=\" wp-image-920687 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/IMG_9911-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"336\" height=\"252\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/IMG_9911-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/IMG_9911-804x603.jpg 804w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/IMG_9911-968x726.jpg 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/IMG_9911-187x140.jpg 187w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/IMG_9911-1500x1125.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/IMG_9911-320x240.jpg 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/IMG_9911-640x480.jpg 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/IMG_9911-200x150.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;This is something that a kid designs and actually gets inside,&#8221; says Thomas.\u00a0&#8220;When I was a kid, I was really frustrated that everything was always kid-sized and scaled down, and it was never as cool as what you saw in the commercials.

While Facebook&#8217;s new publishing platform, Instant Articles, has had some success with reaching and engaging users, the ad restrictions placed on its 20 initial publishers have proven problematic.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Facebook is supposedly\u00a0thinking hard about the ad regulations on the Instant Articles platform, according to a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/facebook-mulls-ad-changes-for-instant-articles-after-publisher-pushback-1447281399\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Street Journal<\/a> report last week. Currently, Instant Articles only allows a single large banner ad per 500 words&#8211;a far cry from the high-dollar ads that appear on publisher websites. Unsurprisingly, in a world where ad-blockers kill websites, publishers are pushing back.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Early number indicate that engagement is high and that user experience is better on mobile using Instant Articles than it is on your average mobile-friendly publisher website. Instant Articles (IA) lets publishers tap Facebook&#8217;s massive audiences faster and with better engagement and retention, but the problem is that the ad revenue on Instant Articles pales in comparison to what publishers can achieve on their own website. Without the interference of ad-blockers, anyway.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The tensions here are obvious: Facebook wants IA to do well &#8212; it wants the user experience to be stellar and for people to come to the app often and it knows that most people hate ads. Publishers want eyes on their content, but they also need ad money to sustain operations. Advertisers want to keep ad budgets low. Clearly something&#8217;s gotta give, right?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;Instant Articles is fairly new,&#8221; says Forrester analyst Erna Alfred Liousas. &#8220;Given the benefits Facebook sees from rich media, it appeared odd they wouldn&#8217;t allow rich media ads in Instant Articles. I believe they are revisiting that point. Providing publishers with an environment that mirrors the formats generating success on their websites is a much needed change.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Facebook&#8217;s Instant Articles product manager Michael Reckhow told WSJ that Facebook will be working with publishers to balance their advertising needs with user experience. He didn&#8217;t give much in the way of details, but\u00a0Michael Jude,\u00a0Frost &amp; Sullivan&#8217;s Stratecast Consumer Communication Services Research Manager, postulates that Facebook is likely already overhauling their ad strategy.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;The balancing act it is trying to walk is one that allows enough copy to be effective, without creating, in essence, an infomercial size piece,&#8221; says Jude. &#8220;In addition, it wants to encourage volume of transmissions, since the revenue model is built on a price per push.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Liousas echoes the need for balance: &#8220;To keep these publishers interested for the near future, Facebook has to find a balance between its needs of driving a profit and the publishers&#8217; needs of driving near equal placement value to what is generated on their websites.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The key will be keeping publishers interested and bringing more outlets onto the platform when IA struggles to provide the kind of revenue that mobile websites bring. Traffic is important, but it&#8217;s still ad dollars that make the online publishing world go &#8217;round.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;Although there was a fairly robust response to IA, with 20 or so interested publishers,&#8221; says Jude, &#8220;that number has been dwindling as the experience with IA has failed to live up to more common types of advertising. Any channel form advertising content that runs through Facebook is good for Facebook, since it enables Facebook to capture part of the advertising spend.\u00a0\u00a0The more advertising the better: Google built its business on this notion and Facebook is trying to find ways to emulate Google.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Even with the ad shakeups, though, it seems unlikely that publishers will turn their backs the valuable Facebook audience that comes with Instant Articles.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any reason why this ad-format tinkering should cause any publishers to withdraw from the Instant Articles program,&#8221; says Forrester publishing analyst Susan Bidel.<i>\u00a0&#8220;<\/i>Both Facebook and publishers at large are keenly aware that they must offer users a premium experience. Now advertisers need to step up and pay for the sort of showcase environment that premium publishers both in the Instant Article program and outside it offer them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">While changing advertiser behavior may prove difficult, it would certainly relieve some of the tension in the online publishing industry outside of Instant Articles. Though we&#8217;re likely to see Instant Articles changing in an attempt to strike some kind of middle-ground between user experience and the ads that publishers need to survive, the evolution of IA may involve much more than bigger banners and rich media.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;This could evolve into an interactive advertising medium that combines social media, with targeted advertising and crowd evaluation, says Jude. &#8220;They are looking for the magic combination and it will be interesting to watch it evolve.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s hard enough to produce the news, but making money from it is an entirely different challenge &#8212; one that many of&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611562,"featured_media":920162,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359216066,359234157,359234158],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920731"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611562"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920731"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920731\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920162"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920731"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920731"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920731"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920534,"date":"2015-11-14T05:00:54","date_gmt":"2015-11-14T13:00:54","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920534"},"modified":"2015-11-13T15:42:35","modified_gmt":"2015-11-13T23:42:35","slug":"why-publishers-cant-afford-to-ignore-deliverability","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/14\/why-publishers-cant-afford-to-ignore-deliverability\/","title":{"rendered":"Why publishers can\u2019t afford to ignore deliverability"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tony is CEO of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.postup.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">PostUp<\/a>.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">From Lena Dunham to TechCrunch, it seems like everyone is getting into email newsletters these days. It should come as no surprise that email is becoming the new darling among publishers, since mobile users love to kick back and read a curated digest of great content every day. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As newsletters take off, it is important that publishers not just focus on click-through rates, but keep deliverability, inbox placement and readability top of mind. These factors could be the most important details in email marketing, yet are often overlooked by publishers who are blinded by clicks. However, an email that is not delivered to a subscriber\u2019s inbox is effectively worthless; if a subscriber doesn\u2019t get it, they can\u2019t click through. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Engagement is one of the key factors that impacts deliverability. The ISPs look at what you are sending and who you are sending it to in order to determine whether or not it should be placed in the inbox or some other folder. The fact is that you don\u2019t get placed in the inbox if people don\u2019t open and click your messages. If your recipients are engaging with the communications that you are sending because they are well-formatted and providing valuable information, then the ISPs have no other option than to deliver your messages to the inbox. Engaged recipients are reinforcing the idea that the message is relevant and deserves good placement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Creating a strategy around engagement will improve deliverability, which will lead to a more successful email program. To boost engagement, you should consider the following points:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Have a clear email-specific strategy.<\/strong> Don\u2019t just dump web content in an email and call it a day. While publishers are very good at creating content, they are often challenged in determining which content makes the most sense in an email. Publishers need to make decisions about content based on who is signing up and customer behavior. Unfortunately, by not considering deliverability, publishers often end up formatting emails that are optimized to their website rather than considering how it would best generate traffic to the website. Instead, publishers should adopt a well-thought-out communication strategy for the email itself to improve deliverability and inbox placement.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Design for mobile &amp; execute campaign previews.<\/strong> As mobile engagement continues to grow, previewing becomes a necessary task before you hit send. Viewing how an email will look across webmail clients and mobile devices using rendering reports can help publishers optimize the creative, which in turn makes the message more clickable. This helps to optimize the creative before you send which in turn increases the chances of driving engagement. Better engagement equals better delivery rates.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Use targeting techniques to increase engagement.<\/strong> Unfortunately, a lot of publishers have a &#8220;batch and blast&#8221; mentality and send emails to anyone who has ever signed up for their list, and the emails become irrelevant for many. This can negatively impact deliverability rates. For example, if you have a million recipients on your list and you always send to the entire list, you could hurt your delivery if an overwhelming majority of those recipients never engage. It tells the ISPs that you aren\u2019t sending relevant communications and could eventually lead to spam folder delivery. Because engagement affects inbox placement, targeting plays a role in deliverability, and publishers that want to land in the inbox should consider targeting their messaging.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Publishers have to send relevant, engaging content that people will open and click. If you send something that people don\u2019t open and click, you will have challenges. If you don\u2019t consider these elements, then you are not likely to find the inbox because poor engagement will lead to poor delivery rates. Don\u2019t forget: if the email doesn\u2019t make it to the inbox, no one will open it, no one will click on it, and you won\u2019t make money. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tony is CEO of PostUp.

By the end of next year, the industry will take colossal strides to combat fraud and eliminate bogus inventory, while simultaneously working to meet advertisers\u2019 growing demand for mobile video ads. Savvy businesses will continue to buy or build platforms that allow them to offer a complete mobile video ad solution \u2014 the content, the audience, and the ad tech \u2014 and increase their revenue streams. As with any massive overhaul (and it will be massive), there will be casualties. But, the end result will be more effective and more secure mobile video advertising opportunities to help feed the already burgeoning demand. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here\u2019s what we know. Advertisers and agencies are scrambling to create or fine-tune their mobile strategies and to contend with the now irrefutable fact that consumers are spending more time on their mobile devices. We\u2019ve been talking about a \u201cmobile-first\u201d media landscape for a while; now it\u2019s time for marketing strategies to catch up with user behavior. Simultaneously, consumer and brand interest in video is mounting, and for basically the same reason: high-quality video is engaging. Neither mobile nor video is without its challenges, but marrying the two helps alleviate some of the issues. Video mobile ads are more engaging than mobile banner ads. Couple that with the rich data we can harness through mobile devices, and you open up video to a host of new marketing use cases. Now we can monitor viewers\u2019 subsequent behaviors and better measure the ROI of our investments. Video isn\u2019t just for brand awareness anymore. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Within the next few years, it\u2019s basically inevitable that the bulk of ad buying, mobile included, will be done programmatically. <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.emarketer.com\/Article\/Programmatic-Direct-Takes-Majority-of-Programmatic-Ad-Dollars\/1013035\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Spending levels are already soaring<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Programmatic buying is lauded for its benefits, which include increased efficiency, more accurate targeting capabilities, and easy scalability. But it\u2019s also rife with fraud. According to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">research from the<\/span> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.whiteops.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Association of National Advertisers and WhiteOps<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, 23 percent of video ad views are actually from bots. This is simply not acceptable. As an increasing number of brands and agencies look to embrace video advertising, they\u2019ll clamor for more stringent regulations and better protection against fraudulent traffic. They\u2019ll also take a hard look at programmatic trading, the practice of buying media and then reselling it for profit. In the not-too-distant future, 2016 will be the year brands demand more transparency across the board. The writing is already on the wall. BrightRoll has begun cleaning up its traffic and taking steps <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/info.brightroll.com\/traffic-fraud-in-video-advertising.html?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=library&amp;utm_campaign=2014Q4TrafficFraud\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">to educate the market<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> about the ubiquity of fraud. AppNexus, which has been a big player in programmatic trading, made huge strides this year by working to improve the quality of its inventory, limiting media arbitrage and <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.appnexus.com\/2015\/viewability-is-better-for-publishers-with-yieldex-analytics\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">increasing viewability<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Perhaps predictably, it\u2019s also <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.beet.tv\/2015\/08\/appnexusokelley.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">shifting its focus toward video<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. \u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 id=\"mobile-media-consolidation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mobile media consolidation <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Even with the growing amount of fraudulent mobile video traffic, there is still a pressing supply and demand issue. There\u2019s simply not enough inventory to meet advertisers\u2019 needs. We\u2019re going to have to rethink our definition of \u201cpremium\u201d and become more open to running video ads in-stream and alongside user-generated content, a change that\u2019s already underway\u2014just look at the buzz Snapchat\u2019s video ad product is generating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The increased demand for mobile video will continue to drive up prices for publishers, which is part of the reason why a growing number of companies are working to buy or create quality video content. Mobile media has already begun consolidating, as content distributors and content creators realize they\u2019re more powerful together. Look at AOL\u2019s acquisition of Adapt.TV, a programmatic video ad platform, and Vidible, a content syndication solution for publishers. (Expect to see an increase in the syndication of quality content as one solution to the challenge of meeting expanding demand quickly.) With these moves, AOL now has the audience, content, and technology needed to offer advertisers a full-service ad solution. And don\u2019t forget, it\u2019s owned by Verizon, which recently announced a plan to launch its own Hulu\/Netflix-like app (<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.verizonwireless.com\/landingpages\/go90\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Go90<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) for streaming mobile video, and also revealed that <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/variety.com\/2015\/digital\/news\/verizon-may-strike-partnerships-with-other-carriers-to-take-go90-international-1201613102\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">its focus is on mobile video<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">RTL Group\u2019s purchase of SpotXchange last year and Facebook\u2019s acquisition of LiveRail, the third-largest online video advertising management platform, are also harbingers of industry-wide change. Facebook can now extend its video ad reach beyond its platform, and LiveRail is already working to improve the quality of its exchange by cutting out providers who don\u2019t work directly with advertisers. If they manage to improve their supply and leverage Facebook\u2019s in-depth data, the results will be what marketers\u2019 dreams are made of: the ability to reach their target audience via quality mobile video traffic while gaining precise insight into what type of creative is resonating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These types of intelligent mergers will continue as the industry works to reduce fraud, improve viewability, and better harness data. These changes will punish suppliers with less-than-stellar practices, but the net result will be an industry that\u2019s more mature, regulated, and effective. Mobile video advertising will be a no-brainer investment. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Galia is COO and head of sales for\u00a0Taptica.

But instead of blocking those &#8220;content ads,&#8221; the extension replaces them with links to presumably superior\u00a0content\u00a0curated by Calacanis&#8217; Inside.com editorial team. The extension, called <a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/ad-replacer-turn-spammy-a\/eckeeomlpacfhejaameopnmgipghaoam\">AdReplacer<\/a>, is currently available as a free download.<\/p>\n<p>AdReplacer debuts shortly after <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/09\/17\/safaris-content-blockers-good-for-privacy-bad-for-publishers\/\">fears about an online-mediapocalypse<\/a> were stoked when Apple built support for content blockers into iOS 9 earlier this year. Pundits wondered how mobile ad-blocking might affect small publishers while developers exploited, and sometimes <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/09\/21\/with-peaces-removal-ghostery-leaves-some-unanswered-questions\/\">questioned the ethics of<\/a>, the opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>The difference here is that AdReplacer doesn&#8217;t\u00a0affect most advertisements, only those provided by Taboola, Outbrain, and Zergnet. The extension also isn&#8217;t monetized, or in other words, making money by eliminating ads that would otherwise generate revenue for web publishers. You could theoretically argue that replacing ads with something more appealing\u00a0could strengthen readership on those sites. But publishers are still technically losing potential revenue, so many may not see this as much of a distinction between other ad blockers.<\/p>\n<p>Sponsored recommendation companies are predictably\u00a0not happy, with Outbrain&#8217;s\u00a0chief exec calling Calacanis an &#8220;anti-founder&#8221; because of AdReplacer, according to a <a href=\"http:\/\/calacanis.com\/2015\/11\/11\/fight-fight-my-response-to-the-ceo-of-outbrain\/#more-35066\" target=\"_blank\">blog post<\/a> from Calacanis.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our little &#8216;ad replacer&#8217; is just a reaction to the level of aggression that publishers and ad platforms have shown to consumers,&#8221; Calacanis wrote in response to the criticism. &#8220;If you guys tone down the ads, no one will install AdReplacer.&#8221; He added:<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-finally-on-the-moral\"><p>Finally, on the moral issue, let\u2019s be candid for a moment. Startups are a competition of ideas, with consumers as the judges. Helping consumers avoid pain (what we do) is as (or more?) valid as inflicting pain on consumers because they have no choice (what you do).<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the statement offered by\u00a0Outbrain in response to my request for comment:<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-behind-his-pretty-la2\"><p>Behind his pretty language about the best content on the web, Jason is offering up exactly what we do \u2013 personalized content recommendations based on what people are consuming. The big difference is that Outbrain&#8217;s approach has become a revenue lifeline for struggling publishers, while his approach steals the audience from some of the most loved publishers in the world, and deprives them of their revenue. We\u2019d be highly suspicious of a service that takes users from publishers.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>A spokeswoman for Taboola said in an email that the company would &#8220;like to politely decline on commenting here.&#8221; Calacanis said he would respond to emailed questions, but as of this morning none have been answered.<\/p>\n<p>I did, however, speak\u00a0with Contextly co-founder\u00a0Ryan Singel on the matter: &#8220;To me, until [AdReplacer] becomes something that&#8217;s really widely used, it&#8217;s another symptom of a larger problem, which is that we&#8217;ve gotten to an age where publishers need to monetize and they&#8217;ve over-crowded their pages and have terrible experiences,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/contextly.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Contextly<\/a> helps publishers by recommending stories on their own sites at the bottom of news articles. This means that, instead of sending readers to other sites &#8212; the quality of which is far from guaranteed &#8212; people are encouraged to explore content in which they might be interested from a site they&#8217;re already on.<\/p>\n<p>Taboola, Outbrain, and even AdReplacer all work on a fundamentally different principle: That once people are done with an article from one publisher, they&#8217;re probably ready to abandon that website and head on to the next. The tools only differ in where those erstwhile readers are sent once they decide to click a link.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_920727\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Screen-Shot-2015-11-12-at-2.11.30-PM.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-920727 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Screen-Shot-2015-11-12-at-2.11.30-PM-300x117.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-11-12 at 2.11.30 PM\" width=\"300\" height=\"117\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Screen-Shot-2015-11-12-at-2.11.30-PM-300x117.png 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Screen-Shot-2015-11-12-at-2.11.30-PM-804x314.png 804w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Screen-Shot-2015-11-12-at-2.11.30-PM-968x378.png 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Screen-Shot-2015-11-12-at-2.11.30-PM-210x82.png 210w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Screen-Shot-2015-11-12-at-2.11.30-PM-1500x586.png 1500w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Screen-Shot-2015-11-12-at-2.11.30-PM-320x125.png 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Screen-Shot-2015-11-12-at-2.11.30-PM-640x250.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">An example\u00a0of the content people see when AdReplacer is enabled.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Some people might find those tools useful.

He did, however,\u00a0talk about the possibility of an adjacent product (a gadget or app) that could have a serious impact on the health care industry &#8212; because, of course, Apple&#8217;s involvement tends to result in a pretty serious impact on every industry it touches.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">While he gave few\u00a0specifics, there are a few key factors surround FDA approval and technology in the health care sector that might help suss out what Apple has in mind.\u00a0I caught up with Venkat Rajan, a health care analyst with market research firm Frost &amp; Sullivan to clarify a few things about health care tech, FDA testing and Apple&#8217;s place in the medical arena.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;To be clear in terms of definition,&#8221; says Rajan, &#8220;the FDA doesn&#8217;t dictate how a doctor can use a device as much as it dictates how you market what the device says it does.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He gives the example of hearing aids versus sound amplifiers &#8212; two devices that do essentially the same thing and function in much the same way, but are marketed differently. Hearing aids are positioned as a treatment for hearing impairment and, as such, typically come from audiologists.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sound amplifiers, by way of contrast, aren&#8217;t marketed as treatment devices. Because of this distinction, this class of device isn&#8217;t subjected to the scrutiny and regulation of the FDA and, as a result the product reaches the market and the consumers much more quickly.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">So where does that leave Apple? Cook made it clear that they&#8217;re not going to chase down FDA approval for Apple Watch, but that certainly doesn&#8217;t mean that the company will\u00a0leave a potentially lucrative market untapped &#8212; nothing would be more unlike Apple.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;The real opportunities for Apple are something adjacent to the Watch and that probably means some type of peripheral, wearable-type technology,&#8221; Rajan says.\u00a0&#8220;There are a lot of different potential wearables out there that are being explore and so it remains to be seen if Apple has a specific type of patient or disease profile in mind.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There are already FDA-approved apps and peripherals that are available for use with Apple Watch, though the watch itself is not FDA-approved. Apple Watch&#8217;s current role in the health and medical arena is as a conduit for health-related data and communications for those who work in health care. Its role isn&#8217;t particularly different from that of a smartphone or tablet though it is, perhaps, much more portable.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">While its health data collection and activity tracking work well for personal use, the lack of FDA-approval means that the data from Apple Watch isn&#8217;t particularly useful for doctors looking to treat patients and track their progress, which is a key element of wearable technology in the medical space.\u00a0The future of powerful medical technology for consumers will likely revolve around the degree to which doctors and patients can trust the data gathered by their devices.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;A lot of these devices do a good job of tracking information,&#8221; Rajan says. &#8220;But I think it is\u00a0taking a lot of the types of information &#8212; whether it&#8217;s heart rate or activity or blood sugar sensing &#8212; and taking it a level deeper, [such as] being able to collect medical-grade data that an insurance company, hospital, or physician could take a look at and make decisions around.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Apple isn&#8217;t interested in transforming the Apple Watch into the ultimate health monitoring device, but the company is open to creating an\u00a0entirely&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611562,"featured_media":920729,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359215995,36265994,359217451,20052,199732,359221488,359234150],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920715"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611562"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920715"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920715\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920729"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920715"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920715"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920715"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920719,"date":"2015-11-12T08:01:40","date_gmt":"2015-11-12T16:01:40","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920719"},"modified":"2015-11-12T08:01:40","modified_gmt":"2015-11-12T16:01:40","slug":"cola-builds-a-messaging-app-to-enhance-your-conversations","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/12\/cola-builds-a-messaging-app-to-enhance-your-conversations\/","title":{"rendered":"Cola builds a messaging app to enhance your conversations"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/qz.com\/512625\/your-phones-homescreen-is-dead\/\">homescreen is dead<\/a>.

Eventually the app is supposed to get fizzier &#8212; sorry, add new features &#8212; that will\u00a0allow its users to share information from third-party applications like the Fandango movie site or the FlightAware utility.<\/p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div id='gallery-1' class='gallery galleryid-920719 gallery-columns-2 gallery-size-large'><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon portrait'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/12\/cola-builds-a-messaging-app-to-enhance-your-conversations\/to-do-list-compose\/'><img width=\"452\" height=\"804\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/to-do-list-compose-452x804.png\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"\" aria-describedby=\"gallery-1-920720\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/to-do-list-compose-452x804.png 452w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/to-do-list-compose-169x300.png 169w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/to-do-list-compose-79x140.png 79w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/to-do-list-compose-300x533.png 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/to-do-list-compose-320x569.png 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/to-do-list-compose-640x1138.png 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/to-do-list-compose.png 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/dt>\n\t\t\t\t<dd class='wp-caption-text gallery-caption' id='gallery-1-920720'>\n\t\t\t\tComposing a to-do list\n\t\t\t\t<\/dd><\/dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon portrait'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/12\/cola-builds-a-messaging-app-to-enhance-your-conversations\/where-are-you-now-sent-bubble\/'><img width=\"452\" height=\"804\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/where-are-you-now-sent-bubble-452x804.png\" class=\"attachment-large size-large\" alt=\"\" aria-describedby=\"gallery-1-920721\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/where-are-you-now-sent-bubble-452x804.png 452w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/where-are-you-now-sent-bubble-169x300.png 169w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/where-are-you-now-sent-bubble-79x140.png 79w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/where-are-you-now-sent-bubble-300x533.png 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/where-are-you-now-sent-bubble-320x569.png 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/where-are-you-now-sent-bubble-640x1138.png 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/where-are-you-now-sent-bubble.png 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px\" \/><\/a>\n\t\t\t<\/dt>\n\t\t\t\t<dd class='wp-caption-text gallery-caption' id='gallery-1-920721'>\n\t\t\t\tViewing that list in-line\n\t\t\t\t<\/dd><\/dl><br style=\"clear: both\" \/>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\n<p>The &#8220;Cola Bubbles&#8221; will appear in-line for people using the app. For people who aren&#8217;t using it, however, the information will be sent through a link to a website. (Text messages are sent via SMS and will look the same across platforms.) This is supposed to make it so Cola users can use the app even if their friends aren&#8217;t, and it will also get the app in front of people who might not have heard of it.<\/p>\n<p>It might still be frustrating for Cola users to make sure all their communications pass through the app. Non-users\u00a0can&#8217;t initiate conversations; they&#8217;re restricted to responding to message threads started by Cola users. That might bother some people &#8212; how often do people start a new message thread? &#8212; but it will lead to some back-and-forth if a thread is closed or someone uses a new smartphone.<\/p>\n<p>So how will Cola make money? &#8220;This is a free app. Everything you see now (and more) will always be free. Over time we will offer premium, for-pay features, so it will be a &#8216;freemium&#8217; model,&#8221; chief executive David Temkin says in an email. &#8220;We have a set of ideas of what those features might be, but the first order of business for us is to get users using the app. For-pay features will come later.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Temkin assures me that user information will not be shared with advertisers, and that communications through Cola are encrypted, with the company holding the encryption keys. This means Cola is more secure than unencrypted apps but less secure than other services, like Apple&#8217;s iMessage, that\u00a0don&#8217;t hold the keys.<\/p>\n<p>All of this is supposed to make Cola a one-stop app that makes messaging a little less frustrating. Like other messaging apps its utility is limited if users&#8217; friends don&#8217;t use the service, and it might struggle in a world where many people have already <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.com\/2015\/08\/time-to-ditch-texting\/\">downloaded a bunch of messaging services<\/a> because the people they know are unable to settle on a single app through which they can all be reached.<\/p>\n<p>Still, it&#8217;s clear that Cola is part of a growing movement to make it easier for people to manage their lives without fumbling around with a bunch of apps. Given how pernicious these types of apps have proven &#8212; like I said before, they&#8217;re everywhere, from the iPhone&#8217;s keyboard to Facebook&#8217;s Messenger &#8212; perhaps it really is time to ring a death knell for the iPhone&#8217;s homescreen.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The homescreen is dead.

Instead, he estimated that Apple&#8217;s entrance as a competitor would be\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/3048952\/the-dj-behind-dash-radio-believes-apple-swiped-his-idea-for-beats-1-and-thats-a-good-thing\" target=\"_blank\">more\u00a0positive<\/a> than negative.<\/p>\n<p>That was nearly six months ago. Since then, Keeney&#8217;s\u00a0words have proved true, with <a href=\"http:\/\/dashradio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Dash Radio<\/a>\u00a0doubling the total number of subscribers to more than 3 million. Dash told Gigaom that 2.5 million of those are active subscribers, or users that spend an average of\u00a030 minutes per session listening to one of its 65+\u00a0human-programmed radio stations over the course of a month. (The company didn&#8217;t reveal how many sessions per month its users have, however.) Dash said it hasn&#8217;t spent much to market the service to drive that growth since launching, which I believe. The startup has\u00a0only raised $2 million in seed funding to date, and doesn&#8217;t monetize with\u00a0traditional advertising or monthly paid subscriptions.<\/p>\n<p>Dash Radio initially launched in 2014 after Keeney became <a href=\"http:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2015\/06\/03\/dash-radio-wants-to-get-back-to-radios-roots-with-new-dj-curated-music-service\/\" target=\"_blank\">disillusioned<\/a> with the\u00a0compromises both terrestrial\u00a0and satellite radio were making to support advertising. Because of this, radio has been pronounced dead by many people over the years, especially with the rise of Internet-connected\u00a0cars with preloaded music services like Spotify, Pandora, and Rdio.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;d think radio was dead, too, if every listening experience you had over the last decade was basically circling through several genre-themed music\u00a0stations\u00a0&#8212; all of which present listeners with a\u00a0guided list of approved or recommended songs from big labels, intermixed with periodic commercial breaks featuring irritating audio ads\u00a0and DJs who\u00a0sound like they&#8217;re paid minimum wage when on the air. That means streaming music services that simulcast terrestrial radio broadcasts aren&#8217;t much better. On top of that, there are now plenty of free streaming alternatives that offer greater control over the listening experience.<\/p>\n<p>But those\u00a0popular\u00a0streaming services\u00a0don&#8217;t really recapture the thing that made radio great in the pre-Internet era of music, according to Keeney. And casual human curation via shared playlists (a popular staple of Spotify) also falls short.\u00a0&#8220;People don&#8217;t have time (or even want) to sit down and create a playlist with all the appropriate music,&#8221; he said, adding that most streaming services\u00a0just feel hollow when you don&#8217;t know exactly what you want to hear.<\/p>\n<p>Part of that is due to control. Dash Radio lets you switch stations, but\u00a0that&#8217;s all the control you get over the content. You can&#8217;t skip, pause, or influence the playlist on Dash.\u00a0The stations themselves are programmed by well-known artists (Snoop Dogg, Odd Future), magazines, celebrities, long-time radio personalities, and folks who are just really good at directing you towards interesting music.<\/p>\n<p>But alas, Dash still needs to make money somehow. To do that, the service is focused on a mix of different revenue sources including\u00a0a white-label version of its platform\u00a0for celebrities and brand-sponsored stations. Both of those efforts also add value to Dash in the form of curated content that&#8217;s available in the station line up. For instance, the most recent example is\u00a0a <a href=\"http:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2015\/10\/20\/microsoft-partners-with-dj-skees-dash-radio-for-an-all-halo-music-station\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Halo 5: Guardians<\/em> brand station<\/a> from Microsoft, which features cinematic music tracks from Halo.<\/p>\n<p>The next phase of growth for Dash Radio will largely involve partnerships to increase its distribution in connected vehicles, smart TVs, smart home audio systems, and other devices\u00a0that cater to those looking for\u00a0streaming music services.\u00a0Dash also wants to extend an olive branch to music labels to potentially generate revenue.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We think there&#8217;s a place for the labels, the big streaming services, and in future updates you&#8217;ll even see [integrations] that let you save or add songs you hear from a station on Dash,&#8221; Keeney said. &#8220;But we think radio curated by real people is still the best way to discover new music and hold your attention.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Having Apple launch what&#8217;s essentially a copycat version (Beats 1)\u00a0of\u00a0Dash Radio&#8217;s human-curated digital radio service didn&#8217;t cause\u00a0founder Scott Keeney\u00a0(aka DJ Skee) to&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":402,"featured_media":920718,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359234147,359215909,359234148],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920716"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/402"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920716"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920716\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920718"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920716"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920716"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920716"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920710,"date":"2015-11-11T09:47:52","date_gmt":"2015-11-11T17:47:52","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920710"},"modified":"2015-11-11T10:49:45","modified_gmt":"2015-11-11T18:49:45","slug":"facebook-appropriates-rss-feeds-with-notify-app","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/11\/facebook-appropriates-rss-feeds-with-notify-app\/","title":{"rendered":"Facebook&#8217;s new Notify app merges RSS feeds with push notifications"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook has <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.fb.com\/news\/2015\/11\/introducing-notify-a-notifications-app-from-facebook\/\">released a new application<\/a> called Notify that will allow its users to receive push notifications about breaking news, new movie trailers, and more.<\/p>\n<p>The move into real-time news is significant because could help Facebook achieve two goals: It could make the company\u00a0more important to the media, and it could increase the traffic it sends to publishers.\u00a0Now, whether the app will be successful or just something that clogs up your phone&#8217;s notifications feed is another set of questions all together.<\/p>\n<p>But as for the app itself, Notify users are tasked with choosing &#8220;stations&#8221; they want to follow. These are divided into categories from sports and politics to health and entertainment. Stations are managed by sources like the New York Times or People Magazine. Every source can offer multiple stations devoted to different areas of interest.<\/p>\n<p>That might sound confusing. An easier way to think about it is that Facebook has basically taken the RSS feeds publishers used to have on their websites, renamed them, and made it so they can send push notifications to their followers&#8217; phones instead of quietly updating in the background of those followers&#8217; RSS readers.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also brought them into an application it can control, and which will receive credit if publishers get extra attention for their stories.\u00a0Facebook is essentially appropriating RSS feeds &#8212; a freely available tool\u00a0any publisher could use &#8212; the same way it took the Web page and sought to replace it with Instant Articles.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook has been transparent about its efforts to become the only platform that matters to large publishers. Instant Articles promise many benefits, especially the <a href=\"https:\/\/recode.net\/2015\/05\/12\/facebook-starts-publishing-the-new-york-times-buzzfeed-and-more-with-its-instant-articles-program\/\">speed with which they load<\/a> on mobile devices, but their primary function is keeping Facebook users engaged with its platform instead of the broader web.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Notify-Pairing-1-Categories-and-Stations.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-920712\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Notify-Pairing-1-Categories-and-Stations-804x670.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"804\" height=\"670\" data-attribution=\"Facebook\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Notify-Pairing-1-Categories-and-Stations-804x670.png 804w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Notify-Pairing-1-Categories-and-Stations-300x250.png 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Notify-Pairing-1-Categories-and-Stations-168x140.png 168w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Notify-Pairing-1-Categories-and-Stations-320x267.png 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Notify-Pairing-1-Categories-and-Stations-640x533.png 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Notify-Pairing-1-Categories-and-Stations.png 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 804px) 100vw, 804px\" \/><\/a>\n<p>Many publishers have bought into this scheme. Startup companies like Vox Media quickly supported Instant Articles, and even old media publishers like the Washington Post have decided to publish <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/pr\/wp\/2015\/09\/22\/the-washington-post-launches-instant-articles-on-facebook\/\">all of its\u00a0stories<\/a>\u00a0directly to Facebook. Facebook is already the most important referrer to most news sites, and it offers publishers a cut of advertising revenues &#8212; so, why not give\u00a0Instant Articles a try?<\/p>\n<p>Notify makes a similar value proposition. The notifications sent by the service appear on someone&#8217;s phone almost instantaneously; most RSS readers don&#8217;t offer similar mechanisms. Modern readers are all about speed, and making it so they don&#8217;t even have to load a website to read\u00a0something is as fast as it gets.<\/p>\n<p>Push notifications could also help Facebook bolster the traffic it sends to publishers. Digiday <a href=\"http:\/\/digiday.com\/publishers\/facebooks-traffic-top-publishers-fell-32-percent-since-january\/\">reported earlier this week<\/a> that referral traffic to large publishers fell 32 percent between January and October. Such a\u00a0large decline\u00a0seriously threatens the control Facebook is able to exert over the media.\u00a0But that&#8217;s only if people have stopped clicking on article links while also avoiding Instant Articles. The fall in referral traffic could well have been influenced by the rising popularity of Instant Articles, Digiday reports, because they&#8217;re specifically meant\u00a0to keep users\u00a0inside Facebook&#8217;s products\u00a0instead of sending them\u00a0away.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also a bright side: Instant Articles <a href=\"http:\/\/www.niemanlab.org\/2015\/10\/instant-articles-get-shared-more-than-old-fashioned-links-plus-more-details-from-facebooks-news-push\/\">are reportedly shared<\/a> more often than links to outside websites. Facebook might have damned the media industry by making publishers rely on its service for traffic, but it might also have provided the solution by creating a content delivery mechanism its users actually prefer.<\/p>\n<p>The same principle could hold true for Notify. The app will buzz people&#8217;s phones when one of their stations shares something, and those people could then share that notification to Facebook. (They don&#8217;t even have to unlock their phone to do so; a\u00a0&#8220;share&#8221; option is available right next to the notification on the lock screen.)<\/p>\n<p>All of which means Facebook could funnel more users into its products instead of other solutions, just like it did with Instant Articles.

Tinder says in a blog post that this was its most-requested feature, and that the addition will let users &#8220;make more informed choices&#8221; about potential matches and provide &#8220;great conversation starters&#8221; if both people\u00a0confirm their interest in each\u00a0other.<\/p>\n<p>Tinder profiles now sport information about someone&#8217;s age, interests, and the social equivalent to a resum\u00e9 in addition to photos collected from Instagram.

If anything, it now seems like a &#8216;Facebook for future friends.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>That contention is supported by the other update released today: A reorganized view of the messages Tinder users send to each other. The app now separates messages from people who have responded to each other (conversations) and messages that haven&#8217;t been responded to (introductions) into different sections.<\/p>\n<p>Tinder users could use the service to message each other indefinitely. If they&#8217;re looking for platonic relationships, or if they end up making friends with people in whom they were romantically interested, they can use Tinder&#8217;s applications to communicate without having to worry about all the baggage Facebook carries.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, that all depends on people adding information to their Tinder profiles and using the service to do something other than have one-night stands. The company says that&#8217;s how many of its users view the service; the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vanityfair.com\/culture\/2015\/08\/tinder-hook-up-culture-end-of-dating\">perception of the app<\/a> in popular culture, however, tells a different story about its users&#8217; intentions.<\/p>\n<p>These changes might help promote Tinder&#8217;s view of its service.

That&#8217;s up from about half its audience coming from mobile in\u00a0January 2015.<\/p>\n<p>Verizon-owned AOL\u00a0has a large stable of high-trafficked digital properties, including the Huffington Post, TechCrunch, Engadget, Moviefone, and many more, which\u00a0have\u00a0a collective global audience reach of about\u00a0half a billion people per month, according to comScore. And while it&#8217;s not exactly surprising that more people are\u00a0consuming content via smartphones and tablets, it is significant that AOL now has the audience to support its transformation into\u00a0a mobile-first company. (That&#8217;s something <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/04\/facebooks-transformation-into-a-mobile-company-is-complete\/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook also recently achieved<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>The heavy mobile growth is thanks\u00a0to a strategy that began over a year ago that entailed (obviously) a defocus on\u00a0desktop; strategic\u00a0partnerships; internal changes; and being acquired by\u00a0Verizon, according to\u00a0AOL global head of mobile Chad Gallagher. &#8220;There wasn&#8217;t a magic bullet, but rather this is the culmination of all those plans finally coming together. The [mobile audience growth] is a good proof point,&#8221; he told me.<\/p>\n<p>The larger mobile audience may\u00a0also help AOL&#8217;s new parent company Verizon (as well as AOL itself) justify the content side of the business, even though many speculate that it was most interested in AOL&#8217;s ad-tech platform. Digiday <a href=\"http:\/\/digiday.com\/publishers\/verizon-deal-aols-content-sites-face-uncertain-fate\/\" target=\"_blank\">reported<\/a> back in May that AOL had approached Time Inc. about selling the Huffington Post for a cool $1 billion. Similar rumors circulated about a sale of tech news leader TechCrunch, with\u00a0AOL chief exec Tim Armstrong dismissing both claims and\u00a0insisting the company would <a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/05\/12\/aol-verizon-tim-armstrong-interview\/\" target=\"_blank\">remain in the business of content<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As for advertising, Gallagher said the higher mobile audience adds to recent efforts to further\u00a0company&#8217;s ad business. Specifically,\u00a0AOL&#8217;s\u00a0agreement with Microsoft to take over most of its ad sales operations back in July, and more recently, closing\u00a0on the acquisition of Millennial Media. Both of those efforts should help the company better monetize its own content.<\/p>\n<p>The company, however, declined to share any stats on its mobile video audience. Yet, that&#8217;s an area of advertising AOL is increasingly interested in (as is the <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/10\/why-its-impossible-to-put-snapchats-6b-daily-video-views-in-context\/\" target=\"_blank\">rest of the industry<\/a>), which is clear\u00a0from the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/variety.com\/2015\/digital\/news\/verizon-go90-launch-free-mobile-video-1201607727\/\" target=\"_blank\">Go90 ad deal<\/a> Verizon and AOL made with Publicis Groupe last month.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Media and advertising giant AOL is now seeing\u00a0most of its audience &#8212; about two-thirds &#8212; coming from mobile devices, the company has&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":402,"featured_media":920706,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359216066,359216398,359234145,198365],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920705"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/402"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920705"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920705\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920706"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920705"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920705"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920705"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":941028,"date":"2015-11-10T15:05:13","date_gmt":"2015-11-10T23:05:13","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/?p=248449"},"modified":"2015-11-10T15:05:13","modified_gmt":"2015-11-10T23:05:13","slug":"tiger-er-shark-of-the-month-digital-ocean-makes-getting-to-cloud-easy","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/10\/tiger-er-shark-of-the-month-digital-ocean-makes-getting-to-cloud-easy\/","title":{"rendered":"Tiger (er, Shark) of the Month: Digital Ocean Makes Getting to Cloud Easy"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Digital-Ocean-Shark.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-248463\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Digital-Ocean-Shark-300x228.jpg\" alt=\"Digital Ocean Shark\" width=\"300\" height=\"228\" \/><\/a>\u00a0Whilst at <a href=\"http:\/\/githubuniverse.com\/\">Github Universe<\/a> last month, on my way to learn more about the conference host&#8217;s new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yubico.com\/2015\/10\/github-yubico-u2f\/\">hardware two-factor security initiative for its developers<\/a>, I was sidetracked by the sight of a group of developers crowded around a small kiosk, each holding a blue smiling toy shark. Curious, I stopped by to chat with the kiosk owners&#8217;, the crew of Digital Ocean, this month&#8217;s featured cloud computing &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/tiger-er-shark\u2026-to-cloud-easy\/\">tiger<\/a>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Why is this particular cloud provider a tiger\/shark? Simply put, because they make getting onto the cloud easy for developers at a price point that won&#8217;t cause any nightmares as the customer company scales up. But it&#8217;s not as simple as calling Digital Ocean an &#8220;AWS lite&#8221; either because at the moment it&#8217;s a very different offering. And particularly for companies that were born pre-cloud, or for the largest unicorns like Uber, DO does not have all the features and support that you would need &#8212; at least not yet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>From 0 to 236 countries in Three Years<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>What Digital Ocean does offer to new companies and other cloud first entities is a facilitated and positive user experience. And developers love them &#8212; 700,000+ of them representing 8+ million cloud servers. From a 2012 $3.2 million seed round to a March 2014 $37.2 million Series A to its most recent Series B round in July 2015 for $83 million (Access Industries, Andreesson Horowitz, others), the company has found exponential success with a customer-first approach &#8212; delivering a streamlined UX with a straight-forward, transparent &#8220;no B.S.&#8221; or hard upsell approach.<\/p>\n<p>DigitalOcean currently reaches 230 countries and territories. After their Series A the company added datacenters in Singapore, London and Frankfurt. Another facility was added in Toronto since its Series B, and the company expects to onboard India and South America in 2016.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Starter Web Services\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Digital Ocean has established itself in the web services arena primarily by capturing the entry market. If you look at the three aspects of being in the cloud &#8212; Computing, Networking and Storage &#8212; DO really only serves the first leg of the stool. Which means that the company can only handle small co or early stage company requirements &#8212; non-dynamic content web pages, etc. So a chunk of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalocean.com\/customers\/\">developers currently using their services<\/a> eventually outgrow them. *But* flush with cash and building momentum, the company launched its first networking service in late October &#8212; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalocean.com\/company\/blog\/floating-ips-start-architecting-your-applications-for-high-availability\/\">floating IPs that solve the problem of reassigning IPs to any droplet in the same datacenter<\/a> &#8212; and may be able to offer a comprehensive cloud solution as early as next year.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Hidden Barrier to Cloud is Actually HR<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>What set&#8217;s Digital Ocean&#8217;s products from the rest is that you don&#8217;t necessarily need a senior engineer to get your company&#8217;s web presence set up. So DO is not only cheaper and easier to use, but a platform to get you faster to launch. This provides the business with some breathing room as it develops, expanding the base of potential staff whom can handle the website. This has made DO&#8217;s Droplet a popular service for not just newcos, but also for discreet web projects and microsites like the launch of Beyonce&#8217;s secret album and Universe.com (owned by TicketMaster).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Customer Service Your Way (It&#8217;s All About the Love)\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>DO&#8217;s UX goes far beyond the product UI. As strange as it sounds coming from a web infrastructure company, <a href=\"https:\/\/insidedigitalocean.com\/showing-love-to-greece-b15aa9e98275\">one of the company&#8217;s core values is &#8220;Love&#8221;<\/a> and it is practiced throughout the company. I would characterize\u00a0this love as a &#8220;passion for helping others&#8221; and a joie de vivre&#8221; that infuses the organization and is transferred to its customers. Duly noted that their mascot shark is a\u00a0<em>smiling happy one.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How exactly does this Love manifest itself in the business? Zachary Bouzan-Kaloustian, Digital Ocean&#8217;s Director of Support describes its IaaS in this way:\u00a0&#8220;Our entire platform is self-managed, which means that the customer is responsible for what runs on their Droplets. Our Platform Support Specialists provide free support if something&#8217;s not working with the infrastructure. One way that we demonstrate our core value of love is to ensure we reply quickly, and our 30-day average response time for 1,000+ tickets \/ day is under 30 minutes!\u00a0Of course, our 24\/7 team doesn&#8217;t stop there. We often do extensive troubleshooting with a customer to diagnose the issue, even if it involves parsing server logs. This involves extensive experience, and great relationship skills as we don&#8217;t have access to our customer&#8217;s Droplets for security reasons.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But is this love scalable? Maybe not, but certainly the desire for love amongst developers (and us all) is strong so no doubt there is no shortage of demand for DO&#8217;s particular brand of customer relations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Building the Next Generation Infrastructure\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>By getting in with developers early, Digital Ocean has set itself up to take advantage of the tipping point of the Internet of Everything &#8212; when not only all major services but customer adoption for them reaches critical mass worldwide &#8212; likely well within the next 5 years. While newcos are signing up with Digital Ocean today, the company is fortifying and expanding its technical and services staff &#8212; growing from 150 to 200 employees in the past quarter alone.<\/p>\n<p>And the big fish are taking notice: Google, Microsoft and Amazon have sliced their prices 3x since Digital Ocean launched and prices continue to drop. So increasingly the companies will begin to compete on volume &#8212; of customers and services used.<\/p>\n<p>Fast forward 5 years and DO will have all the pieces of the cloud stool well established as well as worldwide presence. If DO can maintain its vision of making web services simple to consume, and successfully build out its offerings so that it can scale with its customers, the company is well positioned to become the go-to web services company for the post-millennial generation. Considering that there are some 20-30 million potential developer customers out there &#8212; it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me to see Digital Ocean as the most distributed &#8212; if not the biggest &#8212; and certainly the most beloved fish in the sea by 2020.<\/p>\n<p><em>**This post was updated at 1:38pm on November 11, 2015 to reflect factual corrections.

Now, instead of having to chance upon a livestream while it&#8217;s still, ya know, live, users\u00a0can subscribe to a feed\u00a0and receive notifications when a stream starts. (The finished video is also saved to the streamer&#8217;s Facebook page for posterity.)<\/p>\n<p>Live was <a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/08\/05\/facescope\/#.fwdzfw:88lu\">exclusive to celebrities<\/a> when it debuted, but it has since expanded to include other public figures like journalists and politicians. It&#8217;s basically the same thing as Periscope, the streaming app Twitter introduced earlier this year, with a focus on people with name recognition instead of anyone with a phone.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to making it easier for people to use the service, Facebook has also shared for what appears to be the first time information about Live&#8217;s popularity. The company says that more than 60 percent of broadcasters are outside the United States; that some streams attracted\u00a0200,000 viewers; and that a stream where Vin Diesel spoke with his fans was seen\u00a0by more than 1 million people.<\/p>\n<p>There might be some contention about what Facebook counts as someone watching the livestreams. The archived streams automatically play, much like other videos shared to the service, and I suspect the livestreams do the same. It&#8217;s possible that a Facebook user scrolling through their News Feed might have become an unwitting tally mark simply because the video briefly started to play.<\/p>\n<p>I wrote about the problems with <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/10\/why-its-impossible-to-put-snapchats-6b-daily-video-views-in-context\/\">these types of measurements<\/a> earlier today when I covered\u00a0Snapchat&#8217;s reported 6 billion daily video views. I argued that these measurements are all but meaningless, and that the only thing that matters is how these numbers change.

But those figures are actually far less impressive (at least right now) when you consider the value of each view.<\/p>\n<p>For instance,\u00a0Snapchat users watch a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/intl\/cms\/s\/0%2Fa48ca1fc-84e7-11e5-8095-ed1a37d1e096.html\">collective 6 billion videos<\/a> every day. That seems like a lot, especially when compared against <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2015\/11\/4\/9671708\/facebook-videos-8-billion-views-per-day\">the 8 billion videos<\/a> watched by Facebook users and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/edmundingham\/2015\/04\/28\/4-billion-vs-7-billion-can-facebook-overtake-youtube-as-no-1-for-video-views-and-advertisers\/\">7 or 8 billion videos<\/a> watched on YouTube in the same time period. Snapchat doesn&#8217;t have nearly as many users as those services, so if it&#8217;s coming close to their videos-watched tallies, its users must be moving picture fanatics.<\/p>\n<p>That said,\u00a0there is some discrepancy between what each of these services counts as a video being watched. As <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-34765929\">the BBC reports<\/a>, Facebook only charges advertisers if a video is watched for more than three seconds; YouTube does the same after 30 seconds; and Snapchat charges advertisers if a video plays\u00a0for less than a second. Apparently these companies can&#8217;t even agree on what &#8220;watching a video&#8221; means.<\/p>\n<p>Those are just the\u00a0numbers\u00a0that determine when an advertiser is charged. While advertising is the lifeblood of these services &#8212; though each also has other ways to make money, whether it&#8217;s ad-free subscriptions or offering in-app purchases &#8212; that doesn&#8217;t always line up with what the companies focus their attentions on. YouTube touts the number of hours its users spend on its service each day, for example, while Facebook emphasizes how many videos its users are watching.<\/p>\n<p>Then there are the differences in how the videos are presented to their viewers. Facebook automatically plays videos that appear in users&#8217; News Feeds (as long as those users haven&#8217;t disabled auto-playing videos in the service&#8217;s settings) so it could tally up videos that no-one is paying attention to. YouTube and Snapchat, on the other hand, don&#8217;t play videos until their users signal their desire to do so.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook&#8217;s method has its fans. The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/auto-play-videos-catching-on-beyond-facebook-1447106795?alg=y\">reports that more companies<\/a> reliant on videos are considering the addition of auto-play features to their websites. But automatically playing videos have their detractors, too, and some Web browsers have <a href=\"http:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/231959\/how-to-mute-individual-browser-tabs-in-chrome-safari-and-firefox\/\">even introduced features<\/a> that make it easy to mute obnoxious videos that play even though someone isn&#8217;t actually watching them.<\/p>\n<p>This problem isn&#8217;t restricted to videos.\u00a0Tech companies measure success in whatever metric suits them, whether that&#8217;s the number of people who have downloaded their application or the amount of in-app purchases those apps facilitate. There&#8217;s no widely-accepted definition; even <a href=\"https:\/\/recode.net\/2015\/02\/09\/the-monthly-active-user-metric-should-be-retired-but-what-takes-its-place\/\">something as simple<\/a> as &#8220;active users&#8221; is presented in the way that most benefits the affected company.<\/p>\n<p>Nor is this statistic favoritism restricted to tech companies. Publishers will often do the same thing: Some tout their pageviews, others their unique visitors, and still others the amount of time the average visitor spends on their website. These numbers are all calculated using different analytics tools that produce differing measurements. Objectivity in measuring the audience for journalism is dead.<\/p>\n<p>All of which leaves reports on user growth, or increases in the time people spend on a site, or whatever metric is being touted limited to talking about changing numbers. Company X has Metric Y and that figure changed by Number Z. (Oh, which reminds me, the 6 billion video views Snapchat is touting is an increase from the 2 million daily views chief executive Evan Spiegel <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/features\/2015-05-26\/evan-spiegel-reveals-plan-to-turn-snapchat-into-a-real-business\">shared\u00a0back in May<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>So there isn&#8217;t much sense in comparing the number of videos watched on Snapchat to those watched on Facebook or YouTube. The three services don&#8217;t just have different purposes &#8212; they&#8217;re also tallying things up differently. Until that changes (which is unlikely) the comparisons don&#8217;t mean that much.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The last few weeks have seen a handful of massive social services announced measurements for video views that reach into the billions.&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611561,"featured_media":910371,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359218214,359230823,359234144,359234143],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920694"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611561"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920694"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920694\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/910371"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920694"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920694"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920694"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920668,"date":"2015-11-10T11:15:11","date_gmt":"2015-11-10T19:15:11","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920668"},"modified":"2015-11-10T11:58:12","modified_gmt":"2015-11-10T19:58:12","slug":"trouble-exploring-the-great-outdoors-these-apps-have-a-fix","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/10\/trouble-exploring-the-great-outdoors-these-apps-have-a-fix\/","title":{"rendered":"Trouble exploring the great outdoors?

Instead of asking why millions of people make the trip to the place where I live, I should be asking why I&#8217;m not taking advantage of the beautiful world that surrounds the place where I keep the many Internet-connected screens by which I&#8217;ve surrounded myself.<\/p>\n<p>Two apps, the all-but-identically named <a href=\"https:\/\/wndrs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Wonders<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gowander.co\/\" target=\"_blank\">Wander<\/a>, both want to use those screens to inspire homebodies like me to explore\u00a0the world around them.

It features images from professional travel photographers, and an update released today allows consumers to order professional prints of those images, with the photographers receiving a small portion of the resulting revenues.<\/p>\n<p>Ahe wants Wonders to\u00a0&#8220;take urbanites, get them to nature, and get them to live a little bit more compassionately and be more connected with nature.&#8221; The idea is to make these people happier, healthier, and more interested in preserving a world teetering on the brink of environmental crisis, he says.<\/p>\n<p>Wonders is organized around the content contributed\u00a0by photographers, but Ahe says the company has never paid anyone whose images have appeared in the app. Giving them a slice of the revenues drawn from people buying prints is supposed to be a way for the company to help support those contributors.<\/p>\n<p>Those photographers have shared images from the Scottish Highlands and United States national parks to British Columbia and the Arctic Circle. Ahe says the idea is that sharing these images will get people to spend more of their time outdoors, whether it&#8217;s in places like this or in their own back yards.<\/p>\n<p>He dismisses the idea\u00a0that the shoots might intimidate people without the means to visit\u00a0the places they depict. &#8220;This is a very standard sort of excuse,&#8221; he says. &#8220;&#8216;Oh, I&#8217;m just not outdoorsy enough, not fit enough, I don&#8217;t have the right gear.&#8217; It&#8217;s very easy to come up with excuses not to do stuff like that.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Wonders tries to accommodate people who lack those means by including less intense photos. &#8220;Most of [Wonders&#8217; content]\u00a0is celebrating\u00a0people who just take a car, or a bike, or a truck, and just go in any direction and find whatever feels good,&#8221; Ahe says. &#8220;Adventure like that is already good enough.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Still, an app populated with images from people traveling around areas that most people won&#8217;t visit in their lifetimes doesn&#8217;t offer a lot of guidance as to what those people can\u00a0do without breaking the bank. That&#8217;s where Wander, which was also created to inspire wanderlust in its users, might come in.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"what%c2%a0to-do-once-youre-out\">What\u00a0to do once you&#8217;re outside<\/h3>\n<p>Despite their shared fixation on the outdoors, Wander couldn&#8217;t be more different from Wonders. It&#8217;s a side project from two developers, not a startup that went through TechStars Austin; it&#8217;s based on user-generated content, not contributions from professionals; and it doesn&#8217;t bill itself as a magazine.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_920701\" style=\"width: 179px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/screen322x572.jpeg?quality=80&amp;strip=all\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-920701\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/screen322x572-169x300.jpeg\" alt=\"A shot of some possible things to do in your area from Wander's iOS app.\" width=\"169\" height=\"300\" data-attribution=\"Wander\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/screen322x572-169x300.jpeg 169w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/screen322x572-79x140.jpeg 79w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/screen322x572-300x533.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/screen322x572-320x568.jpeg 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/screen322x572.jpeg 322w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A shot of some possible things to do in your area from Wander&#8217;s iOS app.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Wander instead focuses on allowing people to track their hikes, collect whatever images they took during their trek, and share the entire thing as a mapped-out journey that anyone can follow. It&#8217;s less like a travel publication and more like\u00a0a combination of existing hiking-tracking apps and Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We wanted to let people tell the full story of their adventure,&#8221; says Wander co-creator Timothy Sakhuja. This would in turn\u00a0&#8220;help people more easily discover things that excite them and hikes they want to go out and do &#8212; and they can do them, because they have a GPS trace associated with the journal.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The app is pretty simple at the moment. Sakhuja says the team would like to add more features, such as integrations with existing hiking apps and a location-based feed, to the application when they have the opportunity. Right now Wander isn&#8217;t under any pressure to take on funding or monetize itself.<\/p>\n<p>It might be unfair to compare these two applications. They&#8217;re quite different in terms of the companies behind them, their presentation, and the way they want to achieve their goals. But the goal is just about the same: Inspiring people to put their phone away for a moment to experience the natural world.<\/p>\n<p>In the process, they might just teach people to appreciate what&#8217;s available to them. It certainly worked for me: In the time it took to test both these apps and ask questions of Ahe and Sakhuja, I found myself appreciating the place I live just a little bit more than I had in the past. That&#8217;s good enough for me.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Growing up in a beautiful place makes you take a lot of things for granted.

If you&#8217;re treating the brewing process anything like making coffee then it&#8217;s likely you haven&#8217;t. See,\u00a0tea is actually a very complex creature with hundreds of different flavor profiles and dozens of infusing possibilities. The key is in the process of brewing, which takes a bit more effort since boiling temperatures and steeping time are big factors. That&#8217;s\u00a0something startup Teforia&#8217;s new infuser\u00a0device wants to make easier.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;What&#8217;s the best way to present that ritualistic quality to a tea drinker in this really chaotic, busy world, but at the same time figure out how to make the best tea possible on a very scientific level?,&#8221; is the question posed by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teforia.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Teforia<\/a> CEO and cofounder Allen Han, who\u00a0left his product design work at the likes of Microsoft, HTC and Amazon to focus on helping people get the most out of their hot beverage.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;Tea is very much like wine. Different terroirs of the world will actually have different tea. And on top of that, tea adds another level complexity beyond wine because tea has four seasons in which they harvest,&#8221; says Teforia CEO and cofounder Allen Han, who first got the idea for the\u00a0smart tea infusion device after having a sub-part experience at a high-end coffee shop. &#8220;Each season will actually add a different flavor to the tea.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As for Teforia&#8217;s infuser, on the surface it doesn&#8217;t add much in the way of complexity to the ritual of making tea. In many ways, it&#8217;s still just adding water. Inside the machine is a different story, though. It employs machine-learning, a wide-open system, and precise infusion processes to ensure the perfect cup. Tea is measured using compostable pods (a far cry from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2015\/03\/the-abominable-k-cup-coffee-pod-environment-problem\/386501\/\">landfill-stuffing plastic nightmares that are Keurig&#8217;s K-cups<\/a>)\u00a0equipped with RFID tags that pull tea information and carefully-honed recipes from the Internet. Users simply place the pod on the reader on top of the machine to pull the correct recipe before adding it to an infusion globe.\u00a0Teforia&#8217;s machine then brews in different courses (like phases of infusion) rather than a single imprecise infusion.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;Instead of doing one single batch of tea\u2026 we&#8217;ll divide that into multiple infusions, and that&#8217;s part of our SIPS Technology (Selective Infusion Profile System),&#8221; Han explains.\u00a0&#8220;We do that because tea is actually very complicated, and there&#8217;s actually 200+ different chemical compounds in there.

You&#8217;ll also have access to a flavor wheel\u00a0that&#8217;ll let you customize the taste of the tea based on four basic notes: floral, savory, fruity and earthy. Using the SIPS tech, the machine will adjust the courses to bring out different aspects of certain teas.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_920662\" style=\"width: 197px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Teforia_iPhone_FlavorWheel.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-920662\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Teforia_iPhone_FlavorWheel-187x300.jpg\" alt=\"The FlavorWheel allows users to customize the specific notes and tasting profiles within a brewing recipe.\" width=\"187\" height=\"300\" data-attribution=\"Teforia\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Teforia_iPhone_FlavorWheel-187x300.jpg 187w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Teforia_iPhone_FlavorWheel-502x804.jpg 502w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Teforia_iPhone_FlavorWheel-968x1551.jpg 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Teforia_iPhone_FlavorWheel-87x140.jpg 87w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Teforia_iPhone_FlavorWheel-936x1500.jpg 936w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Teforia_iPhone_FlavorWheel-300x481.jpg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Teforia_iPhone_FlavorWheel-320x513.jpg 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Teforia_iPhone_FlavorWheel-640x1026.jpg 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Teforia_iPhone_FlavorWheel-804x1289.jpg 804w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/Teforia_iPhone_FlavorWheel.jpg 1364w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 187px) 100vw, 187px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The FlavorWheel allows users to customize the specific notes and tasting profiles within a brewing recipe.<\/p><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;Prior to Teforia, it was very difficult for anyone to actually taste the seasonality in tea, but now we&#8217;re able to fine-tune to the level that you&#8217;ll be able to taste a summer tea &#8212; that&#8217;s going to be a little bit more spicy, a little bit more fruity, more sweet &#8212; versus a winter tea that&#8217;s going to be more floral, more crispy and more light in finish,&#8221; Han tells me.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Teforia&#8217;s app also tracks all previous\u00a0teas and tea recipes you&#8217;ve tried, allows you to share\/discover those recipes with others, and provides a way to connect the Infuser to work in conjunction with your other smart home gadgets.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It&#8217;s easy to see Han&#8217;s experience in product design and user experience in the Teforia machine:\u00a0The product itself is gorgeous. It&#8217;s sleek and uncomplicated, with only two components that require washing (the globe and carafe) and backlit buttons that are only visible when the machine is in use. It&#8217;s small, too, with a footprint about the size of your average coffee maker or stand-up mixer. Teforia&#8217;s infusers available for preorder now and will ship in Spring 2016. The infuser will retail for $1,299 (although the first 500 devices are available for $649).

This content includes iBooks from the iBook Store, apps from the Mac and iOS App Stores, and media from iTunes. Traditionally, each user should have their own Apple ID. This works great in home environments, and can be layered with Apple\u2019s Family Plan in order to allow families to share content.<\/p>\n<p>Work environments are a different story. One of the hardest things to deal with in Apple deployments has been how to deal with Apple IDs. Managing Apple IDs can become unwieldy depending if they decide to use Apple IDs for each user or for each device. To help with this, Apple built the ability to centrally manage some content using a Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution, such as Bushel (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bushel.com?utm_source=gigaom&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=2015-46\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.bushel.com<\/a>). MDM is a service that allows users to enroll their device and then have content sent to that device from a central location. An MDM service can help you get devices set-up and then manage what users can do on those devices (e.g. you can restrict access to features you don\u2019t want used, automatically deploy email accounts, or, if needed, wipe a device that falls outside your control). Content is then usually purchased in bulk using Apple\u2019s Volume Purchase Program (VPP), so licenses are centrally owned and can be reclaimed if necessary.<\/p>\n<p>The VPP allows organizations to buy 10 or 10,000 copies of an app, and automatically deploy that app to devices. Traditionally, each user or device required a unique Apple ID. This meant users needed to create Apple IDs, or organizations needed to create Apple IDs on their behalf. The MDM service then sent apps to devices using these Apple IDs. I have spent months working with schools and companies of all sizes on strategies for managing Apple IDs.<\/p>\n<p>iOS 9 and OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) brought an entirely new way of deploying content to devices. You can now deploy an app or iBook to a device, rather than to an Apple ID meaning you can perform large deployments without having to use unique Apple IDs on each device. There might be other factors that still cause you to need to use Apple IDs, but distributing apps and books isn\u2019t one of them. Many MDM solutions, including <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bushel.com?utm_source=gigaom&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=2015-46\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bushel<\/a>, have implemented this new option from Apple, greatly streamlining how devices are managed.<\/p>\n<p>In order to deploy apps to devices, you\u2019ll still need to buy those apps through the VPP. Doing so allows you to potentially get apps at a discount and provide better management over what users are able to do within those apps. For many environments, removing the need to use an Apple ID will make using Apple devices en masse so much simpler. An MDM can also remove the app from a device and allow an administrator to deploy the app to someone else (for example, if an employee who uses their own device leaves the organization).<\/p>\n<p>Overall, this new feature of an MDM solution further underscores the need to manage devices centrally, no matter the size of your organization. And doing so doesn\u2019t have to be a costly. Bushel can be used by administrators for free on up to three devices, forever, so smaller teams using company iPads, iPhones, or Macs might not even end up needing to pay for an MDM solution. As deployments grow, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bushel.com?utm_source=gigaom&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=2015-46\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bushel<\/a> only costs $2 per device, per month.<\/p>\n<p>Once upon a time, you needed large farms of servers to centrally manage mobile devices. These days, the solutions out there are inexpensive, if not free. If you have a growing number of Apple devices, want to be able to wipe your devices should you lose them, manage apps on devices, or manage what people can do on those devices, check out the many MDM solutions out there, including <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bushel.com?utm_source=gigaom&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=2015-46\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bushel<\/a>, the only one written from the ground up with small businesses in mind.<\/p>\n<p>When you buy your devices, make sure they can be managed through Apple\u2019s Device Enrollment Program (DEP). DEP allows you to ship devices to a user and have them join an MDM solution at set-up, automatically. Using an MDM solution in conjunction with Apple\u2019s new Apple ID-free deployment options, VPP, and a DEP account provides you with the most zero-touch solution available, while being as secure as possible. And when you can give a user a device that\u2019s still shrink-wrapped from Apple that they can set up themselves, you\u2019ve just slashed IT costs and made sure your devices meet company requirements, all while providing users with a personal experience similar to the unbeatable Apple Retail experience. Your employees and coworkers will thank you. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>An Apple ID is an account that users of any Apple device can use to access content on an iPhone, iPad, or&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611559,"featured_media":920698,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359218029,359220099,359223736],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920693"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611559"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920693"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920693\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920698"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920693"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920693"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920693"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":941024,"date":"2015-11-10T05:08:31","date_gmt":"2015-11-10T13:08:31","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/?p=248465"},"modified":"2015-11-10T05:08:31","modified_gmt":"2015-11-10T13:08:31","slug":"recent-enterprise-file-sync-and-sharing-news","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/10\/recent-enterprise-file-sync-and-sharing-news\/","title":{"rendered":"Recent Enterprise File Sync and Sharing News"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Here is a brief round-up of some recent news from the Enterprise File Synchronization and Sharing market segment.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"efss-application-security\" ><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">EFSS Application Security<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">MobileIron published a whitepaper, titled \u201cState of App Security\u201d, that includes results of a survey conducted with its customers.

However, the unauthorized or \u201cshadow\u201d use of consumer EFSS solutions within businesses continues to pose significant information security risks.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 id=\"dropbox-doubles-down-on-busine\" ><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dropbox Doubles Down on Business<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dropbox made several product and business strategy announcements at its inaugural customer event, Dropbox Open, which was held on November 4th, in San Francisco. Most were directly relevant to the company\u2019s increasing focus on businesses, rather than consumers. They are \u00a0briefly summarized in <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.dropbox.com\/business\/2015\/11\/dropbox-open-top-5-announcements\/\" target=\"_blank\">this Dropbox post<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, but here\u2019s the skinny on a few.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">First, it\u2019s clear why Dropbox is doubling down on its efforts to win over organizations. The company announced that it has signed up around 50,000 new organizations as paying Dropbox Business customers in the last year. Dropbox now claims to have 150,000 business customers; that\u2019s organizations, not seats. The company stated that business is it\u2019s fastest growing target market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To underscore the point, Dropbox <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.dropbox.com\/business\/2015\/11\/introducing-dropbox-enterprise\/\" target=\"_blank\">announced<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0a new product, Dropbox Enterprise, which \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">provides the same core security features, admin capabilities, and modern collaboration tools as Dropbox Business \u2014 plus new deployment tools, advanced controls, and services and support designed specifically for large organizations.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dropbox also <a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.dropbox.com\/business\/2015\/11\/early-access-admin-features\/\" target=\"_blank\">announced<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0three new administrative features that will be included in Dropbox Business as well as in Dropbox Enterprise. The new capabilities \u2012 suspended user state, sign in as user, and custom branding \u2012 are available now through the company\u2019s Early Access program, with no general release date given.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dropbox is going down the same road that Box has already traveled. It started with a consumer grade product, added functionality to make it more attractive and useful for small and medium businesses, and now is incorporating the robust security and control features that IT departments in large enterprises demand. The big question now is can Dropbox overtake Box in the EFSS market?<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 id=\"google-drive-adds-new-features\" >Google Drive Adds New Features<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Google <a href=\"http:\/\/googledrive.blogspot.com\/2015\/11\/because-its-gotta-be-super-easy-to.html\" target=\"_blank\">announced<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0three new capabilities that are intended to improve the usability of Google Drive. These new features apply to all Google Drive users, not just business employees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s now possible to receive a notification from the application on your Android or iOS device when someone has shared a file or folder with you. Previously, those notifications were made via email. The new notifications are actionable; clicking the link will take you to the document or folder that has bee shared.<\/p>\n<p>Google Drive users can now request and grant access to a file or folder to which a link has been sent, but the owner forgot to extend access rights. The feature is mobile friendly. Android users can request access with a single tap. File and folder owners can instantly be notified of the request and provide access from their Android or iOS device.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, it\u2019s now possible to preview files stored on Google Drive on Android devices even if you don\u2019t have a Google account. That feature has been available in Web browsers for a while and makes sense in that context. It\u2019s hard to imagine why an Android device owner wouldn\u2019t have a Google account, but, apparently, its is a problem and Google chose to address it.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"syncplicity-plays-catch-up-on-\" >Syncplicity Plays Catch-Up on Mobile Security<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Syncplicity <a href=\"http:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/syncplicity-simplifies-mobile-data-protection-partners-with-airwatch-and-mobileiron-300164822.html\" target=\"_blank\">announced<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0partnerships with AirWatch and MobileIron to help customers secure files on mobile devices. It should be safe to assume that the integration with AirWatch had been ready (or nearly so) for quite a while, since both were owned by EMC until it spun off Syncplicity a couple of months ago. At any rate, these partnerships merely bring Syncplicity even with its competitors, who have had similar partnerships or their own mobile device containerization capabilities for some time now.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 id=\"box-expands-its-european-prese\" ><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Box Expands Its European Presence<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Box has opened two new offices in Europe in the last 3 weeks, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20151015005325\/en\/Box-Continues-European-Expansion-Amsterdam-Office#.Vh_fzo9Vikp\/\" target=\"_blank\">one in Amsterdam<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20151103005213\/en\/Box-Accelerates-European-Growth-Stockholm-Office\" target=\"_blank\">another in Stockholm<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.

It&#8217;s basically Google&#8217;s Image Search built right into Pinterest&#8217;s service.<\/p>\n<p>Pinterest engineering manager Kevin Jing says in the\u00a0blog post announcing the visual search\u00a0feature that it can be used to identify everything from a lamp hanging in a kitchen to the pair of shoes worn by the subject of a photo-shoot.<\/p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/engineering.pinterest.com\/blog\/introducing-new-way-visually-search-pinterest\">a post on<\/a> the company&#8217;s engineering blog, Pinterest&#8217;s Andrew Zhai explains that the company partnered with members of the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center to develop the technologies that allow this visual search tool to function.<\/p>\n<p>This new feature comes hot on the heels <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/03\/pinterest-introduces-a-dedicated-shop-to-open-users-wallets\/\">of a dedicated shop<\/a> from which Pinterest users can purchase items from brands like Nordstrom and the Heist. It isn&#8217;t hard to see how the search and commerce-related features might collide.<\/p>\n<p>To use the example from Pinterest&#8217;s blog posts: Imagine someone likes a lamp they see in a pin. After\u00a0using the new search tool to find more information about the lamp, they decide they want to buy it. So they click a &#8220;buyable pin&#8221; to do so.<\/p>\n<p>That process is much easier than it used to be. That same shopper would&#8217;ve had to use Google&#8217;s image search after cropping out the irrelevant parts of the &#8220;pin,&#8221; found an item, and then looked for a store that sold the damned light fixture.<\/p>\n<p>Pinterest, as I noted in my post about its new\u00a0shopping section, doesn&#8217;t currently make money from brands\u00a0that sell items through its service. That will change &#8212; and when it does, search features like this one will help it sell more products.<\/p>\n<p>Until then this is just an interesting feature that will make it easier for Pinterest users to learn more about an image without ever having to leave Pinterest&#8217;s site or mobile apps.

But while some are excited by that prospect, those in security circles see an enormous challenge\u2014now there are 50 billion access points that are hackable and that connect to higher value targets.<\/p>\n<p>The common example cited by security consultants relates to what happens when employees enter a facility with their own connected devices. Consider an extreme example like a nuclear power plant that has opted to significantly shut down outside internet connections due to the obvious security\/cyberwar risks of losing control of a nuclear power plant.<\/p>\n<p>But what happens when an outside service tech enters the facility, realizes he needs an internet connection to access a piece of information and hooks his 4G phone into his laptop, which is on the internal network?<\/p>\n<p>A nuclear power plant is an outlier example, perhaps, but your average enterprise institution is not. And it\u2019s not just using a smartphone as a hotspot that\u2019s an issue. Rather, a wearable like a Fitbit could be hacked and once it\u2019s on a local network, syncing with someone\u2019s phone that\u2019s in turn on a company network, the vulnerabilities become more clear. Using soft targets like wearables to access harder targets like enterprise servers is not unthinkable, particular if mesh networks increase.<\/p>\n<p>So what do you do about these 50 billion devices? One solution is to begin to have a conversation about putting security on the device itself. We\u2019re seeing the beginning of this with microcontroller makers like Freescale and NXP <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/02\/24\/chip-firms-put-security-center-stage-for-the-internet-of-things\/\">starting to build chips<\/a> with security built onto the hardware.<\/p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can continuously push security software updates to the piece of hardware but with the proliferation of devices out there, this is a tough road to hoe. With billions of devices running multiples patches a year, the numbers add up as does the need for storage and processing power. It gets even tougher when you consider that many of these devices are very inexpensive and device makers are reticent to slow down a production cycle to build better security into a product. This is even more true when the unspoken perception remains that a security breach of something like a fitness wearable is low impact.<\/p>\n<p>There are likely to be an array of approaches to the new world of security threats but one novel approach is coming from startup <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bastille.io\/aboutus\/\">Bastille<\/a>, which has offices in San Francisco and Atlanta, and has raised <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bizjournals.com\/atlanta\/print-edition\/2015\/08\/14\/security-startup-bastille-raises-9-million-from.html\">over $11 million\u00a0<\/a>in early funding. Bastille is looking to track and characterize all wireless transmissions in a given physical area so that companies can begin to know precisely every device transmitting. It \u201csniffs\u201d the airwaves from 50 megahertz up to gigahertz for transmitters. The devices can then be characterized from that information, localized physically, and then potentially associated with an employee badge.<\/p>\n<p>Knowing what devices are transmitting from an environment that needs to be secured opens up the door to better security. One use case is an environment like a data center where unusual activity like a high amount of wireless data transfer coming from a specific rack and row within a facility would give an alert to be investigated.<\/p>\n<p>Bastille is in early stages, running pilot tests with customers. Its early target market is the financial services industry. We\u2019ll see whether continuously sniffing the electromagnetic spectrum of a physical location proves to be part of the IoT security solution, but from hardware to software providers, it\u2019s clear we\u2019re going to need new security solutions to accommodate the growth of IoT.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It seems that the 50 billion connected devices by 2020 figure has become a shorthand for describing just how much the networking&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87621237,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/941026"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87621237"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=941026"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/941026\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=941026"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=941026"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=941026"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920683,"date":"2015-11-07T07:15:13","date_gmt":"2015-11-07T15:15:13","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920683"},"modified":"2015-11-06T14:46:17","modified_gmt":"2015-11-06T22:46:17","slug":"3-truths-about-millennial-tv-viewers","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/07\/3-truths-about-millennial-tv-viewers\/","title":{"rendered":"If you want millennial TV viewers, it\u2019s interact or bust"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><em>Zane is CEO and cofounder of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.watchwith.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Watchwith<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s pretty much taken as gospel these days that millennials are cord-cutters, eager to abandon television as we know it &#8212; torch broadcast and cable business models along the way.<\/p>\n<p>The reality, though, is a lot more nuanced. Yes, millennials are more likely to opt out of subscriptions to traditional cable-TV bundles. But they\u2019re cord-cutting in only the most narrow sense\u2014substituting one delivery system (linear TV) for another (on-demand streaming) and one type of hardware (cable-fed TVs) for others (mobile devices, and TVs and PCs rigged with over-the-top solutions).<br \/>\nThey\u2019re still watching TV shows \u2014 lots of TV shows \u2014 and consuming plenty of programming generated by the \u201ctraditional\u201d TV industry. They\u2019re just doing it on their own terms.<\/p>\n<p>At Watchwith, our team of entertainment, technology, and advertising experts have\u00a0been studying video consumption patterns since 2012. We\u2019re particularly interested in understanding the psychology of what works and what doesn\u2019t for the new generation of TV viewers, particularly when it comes to advertising messages. That said, here are three\u00a0broad findings we&#8217;ve found to be true&#8230;<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"mobile-pre-roll-feels-like-a-p\">Mobile pre-roll feels like a personal violation for millennials<\/h4>\n<p>All of us tend to be deeply connected to and dependent on our mobile devices, but for digital-native millennials, omnipresent smartphones are almost like an extension of their bodies \u2014 and of their personalities. That\u2019s why pre-roll and mid-roll advertising that might be acceptable (or at least tolerable) in a desktop setting becomes absolutely rage-inducing on mobile.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve heard again and again from millennial consumers about their incredible feeling of frustration while watching pre-roll on a phone. There\u2019s a profound mismatch between the pre-roll experience and a personal device like a smartphone. Pre-roll advertising in a desktop browser tab comes off as interruptive, but the same pre-roll on mobile feels domineering, like viewers have been temporarily deprived of the sense of control they take for granted when using their beloved devices.<\/p>\n<p>According to a study just released by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.emarketer.com\/Article\/Young-Adults-More-Likely-Own-Smartphone-Than-PC\/1013202\" target=\"_blank\">eMarketer<\/a>, \u201cyoung adults ages 18 to 29 are more likely to own a mobile phone or smartphone than a desktop or laptop, pointing to how mobile is becoming an all-purpose device that users are increasingly relying on.\u201d But in a phenomenon that MaryLeigh Bliss of youth-market research firm Ypulse calls \u201cad A.D.D.,\u201d millennials are turning a blind eye to traditional ads on their favorite platform. According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mediapost.com\/publications\/article\/247530\/ad-add-why-the-days-of-digital-ads-as-we-know.html\" target=\"_blank\">Ypulse research<\/a>, says Bliss, \u201cwhen we ask young consumers which type of advertising they usually ignore or avoid, 62 percent say online ads, like banner and video ads, and 68 percent say mobile in-app ads. In other words, online marketing \u2014 you\u2019re doing it wrong. It\u2019s not enough to be where they are. You have to be where they are, and match your message to their behavior.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"%e2%80%98interactive-tv%e2%80%\">\u2018Interactive TV\u2019 is entirely intuitive on mobile for millennials<\/h4>\n<p>Many digital-native millennials grew up, or at least came of age, thinking of media consumption as a tactile experience. It\u2019s entirely natural \u2014 indeed, second nature \u2014 for them to feel their way through media on mobile devices. And that\u2019s even more true for post-millennials, aka Generation Z; witness the various videos on YouTube like &#8220;Baby Works iPad Perfectly,&#8221; and &#8220;9 Month Old Baby Using iPad.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>All those years of people fumbling with remotes to navigate through cable guides and various iterations of \u201cinteractive TV\u201d have given way to being able to touch, tap and swipe \u2014 in the process instantly controlling their content-consumption destiny. That\u2019s part of what\u2019s behind the explosive growth of millennial-favorite streaming-gaming platform <a href=\"http:\/\/adage.com\/article\/digitalnext\/lessons-twitch-marketing-millennials\/298261\/\" target=\"_blank\">Twitch<\/a>, which Amazon acquired last year for $970 million as well as prioritizes real-time interaction on its mobile apps.<\/p>\n<p>The very culture surrounding streaming video itself on both mobile and desktop engenders seamless interaction. Consider the billions of shares, likes\/dislikes, and channel subscriptions in just the YouTube ecosystem alone.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"millennials-are-poised-to-inte\">Millennials are poised to interact\u2014in context, in program<\/h4>\n<p>Millennials are incredibly distracted consumers of content. They&#8217;re media multitaskers. So, programming that allows them to multi-task in-program helps them satisfy their natural desire to touch, tap, and swipe their way through their content-consumption journey.<\/p>\n<p>In a recent study Watchwith conducted in collaboration with Magid, we found that more than half of 18- to 24-year-olds are more likely to watch more episodes of a show if it has in-program (i.e., non-interruptive) ads. We also found that in-program ads have higher levels of unaided recall compared to traditional TV ads. The point is to let the show continue flowing, but still get the ad message across.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, while millennials may be inveterate multitaskers, when they\u2019re actually in the flow of content-consumption, they\u2019re ready and willing to interact with brand messages on their own terms.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Zane is CEO and cofounder of Watchwith.

Today, the industry is swaying back and forth, as CIOs struggle to find the right balance of control, transparency, and truth.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, the pendulum has swung too far in the direction of data discovery. While data discovery tools provide speedy data discovery and manipulation, these tools can create analytical silos that hinder the ability of users to make decisions with confidence.<\/p>\n<p>These self-service capabilities create challenges for CIOs, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/doc\/3007717\/embrace-selfservice-data-preparation-tools\" target=\"_blank\">Gartner, Inc<\/a>. Without proper processes and governance in place, self-service tools can introduce multiple versions of the truth, increase errors in analysis and result in inconsistent information.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"is-imperfect-but-fast-a-fair-t\">Is <em>&#8216;imperfect but fast&#8217;<\/em> a fair trade-off?<\/h3>\n<p>That said, CIOs have come to accept data inconsistency as the price to pay \u2013 a tradeoff to achieve speed \u2013 to give business users the ability to analyze data without depending on a central BI team. Both parties seem to have adopted the maxim \u201cimperfect but fast is better than perfect but slow.\u201d\u00a0But is this price too much? The answer is worth delving into.<\/p>\n<p>Backlashes include siloed and inconsistent views of key metrics and data across groups. For instance, lead-to-cash analysis requires data from three different departments (Marketing, Sales, and Finance) and three separate systems (marketing automation, CRM, ERP). A consistent and reliable view of the information between departments and systems \u2013 one that provides a common definition of \u201cLead\u201d or \u201cRevenue\u201d \u2013 is necessary to avoid confusion and conflicting decisions.<\/p>\n<p>Finding consistency with data-discovery tools requires the daunting task of manually delivering a truly governed layer of data without a comprehensive understanding of core business logic. This means having the ability to build and test integrated data models, tools for performing extraction, transformation and loading (ETL) routines across corporate systems, channels for proliferating enterprise-wide metadata, and a demand for governance-centric business procedures. All of which are a burden to CIOs.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"the-end-goal-transparency-and-\">The end goal: Transparency and speed<\/h3>\n<p>Trusted data does not have to be synonymous with restrictive access and long wait times. By implementing transparent governance, CIOs can enable local (decentralized) execution with global (centralized) consistency, reconciling speed with trust at enterprise scale.<\/p>\n<p>But to deliver the agility of data discovery with enterprise governance, CIOs must work to do the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Adopt a data-driven culture.<\/strong>\u00a0CIOs need to create a team approach to BI that balances the use of skilled resources and the development of more localized business skills to deliver ongoing success.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Enable data access to all business users.<\/strong> Creating protocols to access new datasets ensures that all business users can identify opportunities that add value. Multiple layers of security during discovery and consumption are crucial to uphold security. With simple and secure access, users can easily identify opportunities to derive insights.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Create a consistent understanding and interpretation of data.<\/strong> Certify and manage key input datasets and governing information outputs to help align organizational accountability for data discovery. A single view of governed measures and dimensions, for users in both decentralized and centralized use cases, ensures consistency.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Following the aforementioned points to deliver trust and transparency results in big gains. According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dresneradvisory.com\/Self-Service%20BI%20and%20Governance%20Too\" target=\"_blank\">Dresner Advisory Services<\/a>, organizations that view data as a single truth with common rules are nearly 10 times more likely to achieve BI success than organizations with multiple inconsistent sources.<\/p>\n<p>There is a powerful and direct correlation between business success and having a trusted view of enterprise data. Companies evaluating BI solutions must look for modern architectures that support transparent governance at business speed and deliver a unified view of data without sacrificing end-user autonomy. The companies that do will continue to win.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Brad is chairman and chief product officer at Birst.

Normally, when a new technical trend emerges to replace a previous one, it is due (at least in part) to evolved thinking. The odd thing with monolithic application architecture, however, is that nobody ever proposed it as a good idea in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>The idea of loosely coupled services with clear boundaries has been around for decades in software engineering. So, how did we end up with so many apps \u201cdesigned\u201d as monoliths? In a word \u2013 convenience.<\/p>\n<p>The fact is, in many use cases, monolithic architectures come with some non-trivial and durable benefits that we can\u2019t simply discount because it doesn\u2019t adhere to a modern pattern. Conversely, microservices can introduce significant complexity to application delivery that isn\u2019t always necessary.<\/p>\n<p>As a <a href=\"https:\/\/apprenda.com\/blog\/enterprise-paas-microservices\/\">fan of microservices<\/a>, I fear enterprises are blindly charging forward and could be left disappointed with a microservices-based strategy if the technology is not appropriately applied. \u00a0The point of this post isn\u2019t to pour FUD onto microservices. It\u2019s about understanding tradeoffs and deliberately selecting microservices based on their benefits rather than technical hype.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"debugging-and-testing\">Debugging and testing<\/h3>\n<p>Generally speaking, monolithic applications are easier to debug and test when compared to their microservices counterparts. Once you start hopping across process, machine, and networking boundaries, you introduce many hundreds of new variables and opportunities for things to go wrong \u2013 many of which are out of the developer\u2019s control.<\/p>\n<p>Also, the looser the dependency between components, the harder it is to determine when compatibility or interface contracts are broken. You won\u2019t know something has gone wrong until well into runtime.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"performance\">Performance<\/h3>\n<p>If your shiny new mobile app is taking several seconds to load each screen because it\u2019s making 30 API calls to 30 different microservices, your users aren\u2019t going to congratulate you on this technical achievement. Sure, you can add some clever caching and request collapsing, but that\u2019s a lot of additional complexity you just bought yourself as a developer.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re talking about a complicated application being used by hundreds of thousands or millions of users, this additional complexity may well be worth the benefits of a microservices architecture. But, most enterprise line-of-business applications don\u2019t approach anything near that scale.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"security-and-operations\">Security and operations<\/h3>\n<p>Fortune 500 enterprises I work with struggle with managing the relatively coarse-grained application security IT departments use today. If you\u2019re going to break up your application into lots of tiny services, you\u2019re going to have to manage the service-to-service entitlements that accompany this plan. While managing \u201cmany as one\u201d has time tested benefits, it\u2019s also contrary to the motivation behind microservices.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"planning-and-design\">Planning and design<\/h3>\n<p>Microservices have a higher up-front design cost and can involve complicated political conversations across team boundaries. It can be tricky to explain why your new \u201cpro-agile\u201d architecture is going to take weeks of planning for every project to get off the ground. There\u2019s also a very real risk of \u201cover-architecting\u201d these types of distributed solutions.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final thoughts<\/h3>\n<p>Having said all of this, microservices can absolutely deliver significant benefits. If you\u2019re building a complicated application and\/or work across multiple development teams operating in parallel and iterating often, microservices make a ton of sense.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, in these types of situations, monolithic applications simply serve as repositories of technical debt that ultimately becomes crippling. There is a clear tipping point here where each of the advantages of monolithic applications I described earlier become liabilities. \u00a0They become too large to debug without understanding how everything fits together, they don\u2019t scale, and your security model isn\u2019t granular enough to expose segments of functionality.<\/p>\n<p>One way to help reduce and in some cases even eliminate the technical \u201ctax\u201d associated with microservices is to pair them with an enterprise Platform as a Service (PaaS). A proper enterprise PaaS is designed to stitch together distributed services and takes deployment, performance, security, integration, and operational concerns off the developer and operators\u2019 plates.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sinclair is CEO and cofounder of\u00a0Apprenda, a leader in enterprise Platform as a Service.

Not least the principle of resource constraints. Simply put, we have four finite variables to play with in our technological sandpit:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>electrical power<\/li>\n<li>processor speed<\/li>\n<li>network bandwidth<\/li>\n<li>storage volume<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This principle is key to understanding the current Internet of Things phenomenon. Processing and storage capacities have increased exponentially \u2014 today\u2019s processors support billions of instructions per second and the latest solid state storage can <a href=\"http:\/\/smbz.us\/1Q6VJXa\">fit<\/a> 32 gigabytes on a single chip.<\/p>\n<p>As we expand our abilities to work with technology, so we are less constrained, creating new possibilities that were previously unthinkable due to either cost or timeliness. Such as creating vast networks of sensors across our manufacturing systems and supply chains, termed the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iiconsortium.org\/\">Industrial Internet<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This also means, at the other end of the scale, that we can create tiny, yet still powerful computers. So today, consumers can afford sports watches that give immediate feedback on heart rate and walking pace. Even five years ago, this would not have been practical. While enterprise business may be operating on a different <a href=\"http:\/\/smbz.us\/1NfyS5u\">scale<\/a>, the trade-offs are the same.<\/p>\n<p>Power and end-to-end network bandwidth have not followed such a steep curve, however. When such resources are lacking, processing and storage tend to be used in support. So for example, when network bandwidth is an issue (as it so often is, still), \u2018cache\u2019 storage or local processing can be added to the architecture.<\/p>\n<p>In Internet of Things scenarios, sensors (attached to \u2019things\u2019) are used to generate information, sometimes in considerable volumes, which can then be processed and acted upon. A \u2018thing\u2019 could be anything from a package being transported, a motor vehicle, an air conditioning unit or a classic painting.<\/p>\n<p>If all resources were infinite, such data could be transmitted straight to the cloud, or to other \u2019things&#8217;. In reality however, the principle of resource constraints comes into play. In the home environment, this results in having one or more \u2018smart hubs\u2019 which can collate, pre-process and distil data coming from the sensors.<\/p>\n<p>As well as a number of startups such as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.icontrol.com\/\">Icontrol<\/a> and (the Samsung-led) <a href=\"http:\/\/smbz.us\/1Qg56CX\">Smartthings<\/a>, the big players recognise the market opportunity this presents. <a href=\"http:\/\/rethink-iot.com\/2015\/08\/07\/castleos-announces-first-windows-10-smart-home-hub-microsoft-confirms-xbox-move\/\">Writes<\/a> Alex Davies at Rethink IoT, \u201cMicrosoft is\u2026 certainly laying the groundwork for all Windows 10 devices, which now includes the Xbox, to act as coordinating hubs within the smart home.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Smart hubs also have a place in business, collating, storing and forwarding information from sensors. Thinking more broadly however, there are no constraints on what the architecture needs to look like, beyond the need to <a href=\"http:\/\/smbz.us\/1NulTS4\">collate data<\/a> and get the message through as efficiently as possible \u2013 in my GigaOm <a href=\"https:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/report\/enabling-iot\/\">report<\/a> I identify the three most likely architectural approaches.<\/p>\n<p>Given the principle of principle of resource constraints, the idea of form factor becomes more a question of identifying the right combination of elements for the job. For example, individual \u2018things\u2019 may incorporate some basic processing and solid state storage. Such capabilities can even be incorporated in disposable hubs, such as the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.locustraxx.com\/\">SmartTraxx<\/a> device which can be put in a shipping container to monitor location and temperature.<\/p>\n<p>We may eventually move towards seemingly infinite resources, for example one day, quantum sensors might negate the need to transport information at all. For now however, we need to deal in the finite \u2014 which creates more than enough opportunity for both enterprises and consumers alike.<\/p>\n<p><!-- short URL for promotion: http:\/\/from.io\/1L0KIPf --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Technology may be fast-moving but some concepts have remained stable for decades.

This update, combined with the capabilities inherent to the Cardboard headset, promises a more immersive virtual reality experience.<\/p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s another, larger change in YouTube&#8217;s announcement: The service has made all of its videos available to view in Cardboard. &#8220;You can now watch any video using Google Cardboard,&#8221; it says, &#8220;and experience a kind of virtual movie theater.&#8221; This gives YouTube the largest virtual reality content library.<\/p>\n<p>It will face competition, of course.\u00a0Facebook <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/09\/23\/facebook-introduces-360-degree-videos-to-drum-up-excitement-for-oculus\/\">introduced 360-degree videos<\/a> to its service earlier this year, and if its $2 billion acquisition of Oculus, plus its increasing efforts to provide all the media its users could ever want right from its website, it won&#8217;t take long for a full-on virtual reality experience to appear.<\/p>\n<p>Video\u00a0producers are just as excited about virtual reality. The New York Times <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/11\/08\/magazine\/nyt-vr-how-to-experience-a-new-form-of-storytelling-from-the-times.html\">introduced its own<\/a> virtual reality app (which also relies on Cardboard) early this morning.

The Associated Press <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/3053219\/fast-feed\/virtual-reality-journalism-is-coming-to-the-associated-press\">also released a<\/a> virtual reality film with RYOT earlier.<\/p>\n<p>All of which means that some of the world&#8217;s most influential\u00a0publishers are racing to embrace virtual reality while the most popular video\u00a0service and social network duke it out for control of the new market.

People who like what they hear will also be able to add the song to their streaming libraries or purchase the track via iTunes.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We hope by making this experience better, artists will share more, friends will share and engage more, and music will become a better part of the Facebook experience overall,&#8221; Facebook director of product Michael Cerda said in a blog post. The feature\u00a0is currently limited to Facebook&#8217;s iPhone app.<\/p>\n<p>These new music stories are limited in their scope. The songs will be streamed via\u00a0the service from which they were shared. And at least for now, all interactions will be limited to those two services. This means someone who likes a song shared from Spotify is screwed if they prefer Apple Music and vice versa.<\/p>\n<p>There are also many other streaming services &#8212; Deezer, Rdio, Pandora, Slacker, 8Tracks, Tidal, and probably a dozen others I can&#8217;t remember &#8212; that aren&#8217;t supported with this feature. I suspect that won&#8217;t bother most Facebook users, the majority of whom probably use Spotify or Apple Music, but it&#8217;s still likely to irk some.<\/p>\n<p>The feature is reminiscent of Twitter&#8217;s #Music service, which tapped Rdio and Spotify to <a href=\"https:\/\/pando.com\/2013\/04\/22\/twitter-music-more-noise-less-signal\/\">allow its users<\/a> to\u00a0listen to music shared by their networks. That service wasn&#8217;t long for this world: Twitter reportedly considered <a href=\"http:\/\/allthingsd.com\/20131019\/twitter-likely-to-kill-its-music-app\/\">pulling the plug<\/a> on it six months after its debut, and it <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2014\/3\/21\/5534814\/twitter-music-is-officially-dead\">was shut down<\/a> in April 2014.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook&#8217;s music stories are probably longer for this world. The company hasn&#8217;t yet\u00a0built an entire service around streaming music &#8212; it&#8217;s just made it easier for people to listen to the songs their friends already share. That&#8217;s a far lower commitment to the category than a standalone service like #Music was.<\/p>\n<p>That\u00a0said, it will be interesting to see how this affects streaming music services that aren&#8217;t supported by the new format. How many music stories will Rdio or Tidal users have to see before they sign up for Apple Music? How many songs will Deezer subscribers listen to before jumping ship to Spotify?<\/p>\n<p>If music really is as social as Facebook imagines &#8212; and the company\u00a0is often right about what people are sharing to its network, thanks to the vast amount of data it collects and parses every day &#8212; this could make a big difference to people whose friends and family all use a different streaming music service.<\/p>\n<p>Or perhaps it will lumber about without making much difference to most people. If #Music taught us anything, it&#8217;s that even though music is a social experience, it&#8217;s not necessarily a social networking experience. There&#8217;s a difference &#8212; Facebook&#8217;s about to find out exactly how much that matters.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s been a while since the world&#8217;s largest social network gave any attention to music, but today it&#8217;s making another attempt.

While its invigorating to cover the fintech newcos, they hardly have the monopoly on innovation. And, in the words of the legendary and enduring Grandmaster Flash, &#8220;You have to know where you came from to understand where you are going.&#8221; Partnering with the banking establishment can provide insight (and resources) that may save newcos time and iterations later.<\/p>\n<p>Why choose to spotlight U.S. Bank? First, it has what Venturo calls a &#8220;wide lens&#8221; or breadth of business in that it runs a large payments business, is both an issuer and an acquirer, and also has a large retail bank. But mostly I find the U.S.&#8217;s fifth largest commercial bank interesting in that it makes innovation a core component of its culture. Aside from the sending of a C-level executive to speak at an accelerator\/incubator micro-conference despite not having a venture wing, the company strives to support and to work with innovative partners including start-ups. States\u00a0Andy Cecere, chief operating officer for U.S. Bancorp, &#8220;Innovation is part of our culture and it is how we view the development of new products and services. By anticipating what our customers will want or need in the future, we can better prepare our customers and company for whatever is ahead, capturing opportunities and avoiding pitfalls along the way.\u201d Recent examples of innovation from U.S. Bank include advances in mobile payments, voice biometrics, tokenization and integrated mobile and web commerce solutions.<\/p>\n<p>But what I really like about U.S. Bank is that it is willing to be a banking industry contrarian &#8212; and successfully so. One notable example is that while the majority of banks have cut back on small business lending (sub $1 million) over the past few years, U.S. Bank has <em>increased<\/em> its commitment to SMBs. In its fiscal year ended September 30th, the bank stepped up the overall dollar value of its SMB lending by 15.4% over 2014, while spreading its lending over an 18% greater number of loan recipients. The bank lent $776 million via 3977 loans in its fiscal year 2015 &#8212; a modest size loan average of $195,122 per business. Yet U.S. Bank reported an overall full year record performance in 2014 with net income of $5.85 billion.<\/p>\n<p>But back to my interview with Dominic Venturo.

And it wasn&#8217;t as popular among smartphone owners\u00a0as it was among web users.<\/p>\n<p>All that has changed. Some of Facebook&#8217;s most interesting features, like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/09\/30\/facebook-tests-mobile-profile-redesign\/\">redesigned profiles<\/a> or the <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/08\/26\/facebook-announces-a-new-digital-assistant-m\/\">pseudo-artificially intelligent assistant<\/a> called M, debut on smartphones first. And this earnings report shows that Facebook&#8217;s mobile-only users continue to rise, as does the percentage of revenues drawn from advertisements shown to those smartphone owners around the world.<\/p>\n<p>First the mobile-only users. Facebook said\u00a0in its report that it has 727 million monthly active users who only use its service on their smartphones &#8212; a large increase from even just two years ago, when it had 254 million similar users. (It&#8217;s worth noting that Facebook calculations for\u00a0monthly active users includes people who use its service to log into other non-Facebook apps, so these figures are likely to be inflated.)<\/p>\n<p>Next, the revenues\u00a0drawn from mobile advertisements. The company says the category\u00a0represents 78 percent of total advertising revenue, as compared to the 66 percent slice of total advertising revenue it represented a year ago. Facebook doesn&#8217;t just have more people accessing it via their smartphones, it&#8217;s also monetizing each of those users better than it has in the past, too.<\/p>\n<p>It would be interesting &#8212; especially to investors &#8212; to see Facebook break out the numbers on how much of that money comes from Instagram&#8217;s new ads, or how many people use WhatsApp on their smartphones. The company has bought up quite a few smaller competitors over the years, and knowing how each has contributed to their new corporate overlord would be welcome.<\/p>\n<p>But investors aren&#8217;t waiting for that information to indicate their approval of this latest report. Facebook&#8217;s share price rose\u00a0from\u00a0around $103 to roughly $106 in after-hours trading this evening. Facebook&#8217;s gone mobile, and if nothing else, that means it should make Wall Street happier than ever before.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Investors are likely to be happy with Facebook&#8217;s third-quarter earnings results, which were announced this afternoon.\u00a0All of the company&#8217;s most important metrics&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611561,"featured_media":908548,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359218214,359234091],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920659"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611561"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920659"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920659\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/908548"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920659"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920659"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920659"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920657,"date":"2015-11-04T11:50:11","date_gmt":"2015-11-04T19:50:11","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920657"},"modified":"2015-11-04T11:50:11","modified_gmt":"2015-11-04T19:50:11","slug":"heres-what-people-think-about-twitter-likes","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/04\/heres-what-people-think-about-twitter-likes\/","title":{"rendered":"Here&#8217;s what people think about Twitter &#8216;likes&#8217;"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s been a little over 24 hours <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/03\/twitter-swaps-the-favorite-for-the-like\/\">since Twitter replaced<\/a> its star-clad favorite button with a like button that flashes a congratulatory heart when pressed. In that time the social network has been abuzz with comparisons to Facebook, complaints about the implications of a digital heart over a virtual star, and tongue-in-cheek\u00a0calls for people to use star emoji instead of the like button.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, only one thing matters: Does this make Twitter a better service? Switching button labels could prompt people to click &#8216;like&#8217; more often, thus boosting engagement. But perhaps hitting &#8216;like&#8217; will also lead to fewer retweets, which, in turn, could have its own set of changes.\u00a0It&#8217;s a little early to tell how the switch to &#8220;likes&#8221; instead of &#8220;favorites&#8221; might affect the social network. It&#8217;s clear what the company <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/2015\/hearts-on-twitter\">wants to happen<\/a>, and the most vocal of its\u00a0existing users have made their opinions known, too. (I asked Twitter about some of these issues, and whether or not there&#8217;s been a difference in usage in the day\u00a0since the switch, but have yet to hear back.)<\/p>\n<p>That said, one of the most common complaints I&#8217;ve seen is that changing &#8220;favorite&#8221; to &#8220;like&#8221; makes it harder to\u00a0use the button to <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4336\/a-simple-guide-to-twitter-favs\/\">communicate different ideas<\/a>. The veneer of positivity implied by the jovial red heart has proven anathema to Twitter users who rely on sardonic\u00a0lingo to communicate with each other. That&#8217;s hogwash; &#8220;like&#8221; isn&#8217;t more overtly positive than &#8220;favorite&#8221; used to be.<\/p>\n<p>Another frequent\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=send%20women%20hearts&amp;src=typd\">complaint<\/a> might be more valid: The idea that replacing a simple star with a heart &#8212; which has symbolized romantic love longer than it&#8217;s been an interaction tool on social networking platforms &#8212; could make it easier for men to harass women on the service. Twitter already has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slate.com\/blogs\/future_tense\/2014\/08\/06\/twitter_harassment_user_created_apps_block_together_flaminga_and_the_block.html\">a harassment problem<\/a>, and according to the backlash against the change, hearts won&#8217;t help.<\/p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t noticed a change in how I&#8217;m using this button. Besides the novelty of a new animation (who isn&#8217;t a sucker for hearts that pop into being?) this seems like another change that people will whine about and promptly forget. And it doesn&#8217;t matter what Twitter&#8217;s existing users think about the hearts: This is all about helping people new to the service feel a little more welcome.<\/p>\n<p>That might actually be the biggest problem with the new &#8220;like&#8221; button. Much <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/SB10001424052702304795804579097292647760858?alg=y\">like other changes<\/a> that make Twitter more scrutable to newcomers, from the redesigned profile pages to the updated conversation view, this changeup has Twitter users scared their playground of self-involved witticisms might soon be filled by\u00a0people who are sincere and kind to each other.\u00a0Oh, the humanity!<\/p>\n<p>Those people might be in for a surprise. UserTesting found that many people (74 percent of those polled) liked the new hearts, whether it&#8217;s because of the animation that accompanies it or because they think it&#8217;s more user-friendly than the stars used to be. Another 16 percent of respondents didn&#8217;t care; only 10 percent preferred the old way. Most\u00a0people won&#8217;t mourn these dead stars.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, those findings are based on a 50-person survey. Maybe a different batch of 50 people would have different feelings. But I suspect the most damning finding &#8212; which is that 72 percent of people didn&#8217;t even notice the change until it was pointed out to them &#8212; won&#8217;t\u00a0vary across different groups. Twitter&#8217;s core users are upset about something most people won&#8217;t even see.<\/p>\n<p>Not that all of this will matter in a few days anyway. It&#8217;s only a matter of time before Twitter users move on with their lives and forget that a small icon was switched to another small icon with a different name. Call it Twitter&#8217;s stages of grief: anger; humor; acceptance; and forgetting anything ever happened. Eventually the service&#8217;s\u00a0updates always win over users&#8217; hearts and minds.<\/p>\n<p>(Pun intended.)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s been a little over 24 hours since Twitter replaced its star-clad favorite button with a like button that flashes a congratulatory&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611561,"featured_media":920214,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[19740455,181707,359221038],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920657"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611561"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920657"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920657\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920214"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920657"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920657"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920657"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920654,"date":"2015-11-04T11:45:31","date_gmt":"2015-11-04T19:45:31","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920654"},"modified":"2015-11-04T11:45:31","modified_gmt":"2015-11-04T19:45:31","slug":"new-collaboration-tool-table-is-slack-linkedin-upwork-all-in-one","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/04\/new-collaboration-tool-table-is-slack-linkedin-upwork-all-in-one\/","title":{"rendered":"New collaboration tool TABLE is Slack, LinkedIn, &amp; Upwork all-in-one"},"content":{"rendered":"<p class=\"p1\">Communicating\u00a0with people is hard.

I can hear your cries now, bellowing, &#8220;That&#8217;s why there&#8217;s email!&#8221; and I would be inclined to agree with you, but email sucks. A lot. That&#8217;s why we have\u00a0Slack and HipChat, which is great for those working primarily at a single organization, but not necessarily for those primarily doing freelance.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Now meet\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/table.co\/\" target=\"_blank\">TABLE<\/a>,\u00a0a new web-based collaboration tool\/platform launching this week in private\u00a0beta that aims to be an all-in-one for distributed teams, freelancers, and occasional collaborators. Basically if you spend your days doing contract work for many different businesses, this service is worth keeping an eye on.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Table diverges from the recognizable structure of popular enterprise chat systems like Slack and Hipchat by splitting up into three basic portions: tables, people, and discover. The service\u00a0is essentially divided into these three categories, with each breaking down\u00a0into several key modules or &#8220;micro services&#8221; that can be customized to make sense for each project.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;Our approach, even towards the architecture of our web application, is micro services,&#8221; says Table CEO and cofounder Cristian Petschen.\u00a0&#8220;We&#8217;re not really about the communication tool itself. We&#8217;re about connecting people, and being able to build your trusted collaborator network.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5\">Table lets you connect to people who have individual profiles on the platform, regardless of where they work. You can message them privately, invite them to a Table (which, functions similarly to Slack Channels and HipChat rooms), add them to your Inner Circle, or bring them into a Room. (Rooms function similarly to Teams in Slack and HipChat in that they allow you to bring people and Tables together, but you&#8217;re not tethered to a room for collaboration.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Table isn&#8217;t just chat, though. Instead, its purpose is to give you options for communication as it makes sense to a particular project or task via the aforementioned micro services and modules. Some of these will be rolling out as Table moves out of the private beta and into the launch phase, but eventually users will be able to rate each other on performance,\u00a0make voice calls, and even send and pay invoices directly through Table&#8217;s platform.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This brings us to Table&#8217;s other two primary categories: People and Discover, which allow you to manage current contacts or find new collaborators based on your professional network.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">While LinkedIn has something of a stranglehold on the professional networking game, it&#8217;s not exactly a great place for getting things done or finding qualified collaborators for specific projects. Table wants to give users some of the functionality of LinkedIn with a network, but make it possible for people who don&#8217;t know one another to connect much like they do\u00a0through sites like Upwork (formally Elance-oDesk).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be LinkedIn and more in that sense, because you can also put your projects up and people can look at your projects and the work that you&#8217;ve done,&#8221;Petschen\u00a0says. &#8220;Since you&#8217;re collaborating on the platform, it&#8217;s not only what you say about yourself, but also what you&#8217;re doing.\u00a0[Table]\u00a0knows what subjects you&#8217;re working on, who you&#8217;re coming together with, and it has a much better idea of who you are.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">While Table is still in private beta, you can sign up to get on the <a href=\"https:\/\/table.co\/\" target=\"_blank\">waiting list<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Communicating\u00a0with people is hard.

So trendy that it\u2019s now being used to improve the very thing it\u2019s supposedly killing off \u2013 email.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Google <a href=\"http:\/\/gmailblog.blogspot.co.uk\/2015\/11\/computer-respond-to-this-email.html\" target=\"_blank\">announced<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0yesterday a new feature for its Inbox application, which is an alternate Gmail interface designed for use on mobile devices. That feature, called Smart Reply, lets Inbox users reply to an incoming email with a short message (one phrase or sentence) that has been suggested by the application.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Google\u2019s blog post announcing the new feature highlights the natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning technologies that work behind the scenes. Inbox uses these technologies to formulate three possible short responses for each incoming message. The user taps on the most appropriate one to embed it in her response and has the option to manually type or verbally dictate additional text. (Click on the image below to enlarge it and see this in action.)<\/span><\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/smartreply2.gif\"><img class=\"wp-image-248430 size-medium alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/smartreply2-164x300.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"164\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"how-smart-reply-works\" ><strong>How Smart Reply Works<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The three auto-generated, suggested responses are based on the content of the incoming email message and the responses that were generated and selected for previous, similar messages. Smart Reply uses separate neural networks that work in tandem; one network reads and makes sense of every word in the incoming text and the second network predicts best-fit responses and synthesizes them into grammatically correct replies. (See <a href=\"http:\/\/googleresearch.blogspot.com\/2015\/11\/computer-respond-to-this-email.html\" target=\"_blank\">this post<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0on the Google Research Blog for more technical details on Smart Reply.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The principles and even some of the technologies behind Smart Reply are not new. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www8.hp.com\/us\/en\/software-solutions\/information-data-analytics-idol\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Autonomy IDOL technology<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0that Hewlett-Packard infamously acquired four years ago is used to auto-classify digital documents based on their content. Once classified, the documents can more easily be searched for, used in workflows, and archived.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Just last week IBM <a href=\"http:\/\/www-03.ibm.com\/press\/us\/en\/pressrelease\/47944.wss\" target=\"_blank\">announced<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0its new intelligent data capture solution, IBM Datacap Insight Edition, which uses cognitive computing capabilities to read document-based content and auto-classify it. Like Google\u2019s and H-P\u2019s technologies, IBM\u2019s software must initially be trained with a set of control documents and then continues to learn as it reviews documents in a production environment.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 id=\"smart-reply-and-chatbots\" ><strong>Smart Reply and Chatbots<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Inbox\u2019s new ability to read text and formulate multiple, viable short responses doesn\u2019t quite turn email into real-time messaging, but it does help individuals respond more quickly to the incoming messages in their email queue. Pair that with instant notifications of new incoming email messages on a mobile device and email becomes much more like instant messaging and other forms of work chat.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Google has taken a significant first step toward creating an intelligent bot that replies to email messages for you based on their content. Contrast this with the current practice of employing prebuilt, user-defined rules to reply with a canned response depending on who sent the incoming email or based on the recipients schedule (think vacation autoreplies).<\/span><\/p>\n<p>If Google were to apply its deep neural network technology in Hangouts, it would move closer to Slack, HipChat, Telegram and other work chat tools that use bots to reply to user generated queries and as intermediaries between users and integrated third-party applications.\u00a0In fact, Hangouts would have a differentiated advantage \u2013 the ability to parse not only incoming messages and suggest appropriate responses, but to do the same with text-based documents that are attached to chat messages.<\/p>\n<p>It is likely that Google will go beyond applying this new technology in apps like Inbox and Hangouts. Imagine the power of having Smart Reply baked into Android, so it could be deployed on watches, in cars and as part of other emerging hardware-based platforms that run on that operating system. Tap on the watch\u2019s or car\u2019s display and quickly choose and send a response to an incoming message.<\/p>\n<p>Some more advanced variant of Smart Reply might be used to semi-automate communication between nodes in mixed networks of machines and humans \u2013 Networks of Everything. Take as an example the current generation of software (the machine) that listens to social media and discerns trending topics related to a company\u2019s customer-facing operations. This type of software could be enhanced with cognitive capabilities so that it would be able to suggest appropriate Twitter-length responses to an individual tasked with responding to relevant incoming social content.

This indicates that many new fincos are just now coming out of their incubation and beta periods.<\/li>\n<li>To be perfectly clear, SoFi aspires to do away with your old school banking relationships (if you\u2019re a millennial). SoFi\u2019s narrow target allows the company to rely less on lead generation vehicles \u2013 a cost and competitive advantage.<\/li>\n<li>As a whole, SMB lending is in trouble, and that\u2019s exactly where nextgen fincos are finding opportunity.<\/li>\n<li>Lending Tree portfolio extends to medical and educational loans though SMB lending is still its core. The company has loaned $13 billion so far, with $9 billion in just the past year.<\/li>\n<li>Credit Karma claims 45 million members \u2013 representing a quarter of all US residents who have a credit score. As a partner to lenders, the company is currently focused on facilitating the student and SMB loan process, but counts as well amongst its customers a broad base including top 10% earning individuals such as consultants, lawyers and bankers.<\/li>\n<li>The bulk of finco competition resides on the supply front, with many companies competing for traffic and attention \u2013 this situation likely to force many companies to focus on a specific niche, and to become brands and product lines within larger well-resourced entities.<\/li>\n<li>Lending Club on average reduces the debt load for SMBs and consumers by 7% versus their old loans.<\/li>\n<li>Banks for the most part are embracing the fintech newcos (know they enemy), but not so much Sallie Mae which is finally seeing a threat to its student loan monopoly.<\/li>\n<li>That said, SoFi has originated $6 billion in student loans so far in 2015, tiny in relation to the $1.4 trillion market.<\/li>\n<li>Fintech newcos are developing their own models of risk, with a focus on cash flow and income versus credit score benchmarking. SoFi no longer uses FICO scores as a \u201cblunt instrument.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>That said, most established newcos are not using un-tested \u201cwacky\u201d data like social media profiling either \u2013 primarily to adhere to regulations and best practices such as Fair Lending rules.<\/li>\n<li>FDIC reports show that there\u2019s been a rise in bigger loans above $1 million \u2013 up 55% &#8212; while small loans (i.e. for SMBs) are down 24%. So the customer base for alternative lenders is growing, with \u201ceven young white guy business owners\u201d having trouble getting SMB loans via traditional outlets today and seeking other means of financing versus a past demographic of primarily black and Latino business owners from the inner city and other less affluent geographies.<\/li>\n<li>Mobile usability still has a long way to go in fintech, with only a small handful of newcos allowing for account opening via mobile.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>My take:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contrary to some naysayers who believe that we are about to hit a fintech bubble, we are not yet at the peak of the next gen finco wave as companies who have been in stealth mode the past 1-2 years are now emerging, with the strongest finding their product-market fit in the coming year.<\/li>\n<li>Niche in fintech is big business. Whether it\u2019s taking SoFi\u2019s stance of focusing exclusively on millennials, or addressing a single sector area such as auto loans, consumer acceptance of handling their finances online and via mobile has reached enough critical mass to support these niches.<\/li>\n<li>FICO score will be largely irrelevant in next 5 years. While the company has remained under the radar with the Consumer Financial Board, which is too busy attacking the banks to yet look at the underlying flawed foundation\/credit bureau underpinnings of people\u2019s financial lives, the fintech newcos are heeding consumers\u2019 pain and addressing it appropriately with their own measures and credit risk models.<\/li>\n<li>The success that alt lenders have with SMBs will continue to accelerate as new small business owners discover the advantages of going with non-traditional lenders and the word spreads organically throughout local business communities. As some of these businesses grow into small franchises over the next decade, they will continue to be proponents and users of crowdfunding and alternative lending as their loan size needs increase and in some cases, become permanently disenfranchised from traditional lenders.<\/li>\n<li>Mobile is still greenfield for fintech. The companies that figure this out will rule in the next 5 years, regardless of their position today.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>While small compared to more formal tech industry events, the PLAY conference is representative of a new wave of bringing tech to a wider audience in the spirit of Dreamforce (i.e. providing substantive sessions and\/or high profile speakers at low cost\/free tickets) and content curation in which students or \u201cnon-experts\u201d are developing independent voices and running their own home grown events versus passive attendance at more established\/massive industry events. Panels and speakers tend to be less scripted, if at all, engendering honest and meaningful discussion. While not entirely free from \u201cpay for play,\u201d these under the radar \u201cmicro conferences\u201d are at the least refreshing and gaining mindshare as they literally allow everyone to be in the same room, and can be highly insightful when attendees\u2019 and presenters\u2019 guards are down. We\u2019ll be covering more of these organic, niche events in the coming year.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Continuing the millennial and fintech discussion, I recently attended the country\u2019s largest (business) student run digital media conference, the Berkeley HaaS School&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87725674,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359235209,239931,162796,359220250,359217750,359235210,216504,46938,43710,172678,359215952,10625,10585,10523],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/941029"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87725674"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=941029"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/941029\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=941029"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=941029"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=941029"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920649,"date":"2015-11-03T11:13:08","date_gmt":"2015-11-03T19:13:08","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920649"},"modified":"2015-11-03T11:13:08","modified_gmt":"2015-11-03T19:13:08","slug":"pinterest-introduces-a-dedicated-shop-to-open-users-wallets","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/03\/pinterest-introduces-a-dedicated-shop-to-open-users-wallets\/","title":{"rendered":"Pinterest introduces a dedicated shop to open users&#8217; wallets"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Pinterest has introduced a dedicated shopping area to its mobile apps to promote the so-called\u00a0&#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.pinterest.com\/en\/buyable-pins-rolling-out-today\">buyable pins<\/a>&#8221; added to its service earlier this year.<\/p>\n<p>Pinterest says it will be rolling out <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.pinterest.com\/en\/buyable-pins-are-coming-android\">the dedicated shopping section<\/a> to both iOS and Android smartphone users over the next couple of weeks.

The tech is exciting not only because of the rise of virtual reality gadgets entering the consumer market, but also because it seems like the precursor to things like Star Trek&#8217;s holodeck. While the company wasn&#8217;t able to discuss details of its work with Stewart and HBO, Otoy cofounder CEO Jules Urbach was able to shed some light about how the company&#8217;s technology could help news-focused video content.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The real takeaway [from this announcement] is that media is changing. We&#8217;re about to enter into a whole new era &#8212; with wearables, immersive computing, VR &#8212; where everything needs to be rethought; from capturing to rendering to the content creation tools themselves,&#8221; Urbach told me.<\/p>\n<p>The 360-capture technology and overall video content platform produced by Otoy has potential to enhance the type of coverage in ways that may seem frivolous or too time-consuming right now.\u00a0Urbach explained that the company&#8217;s tech is rendering video that captures as much information as possible about a scene (so, you aren&#8217;t just shooting video of an object or setting, you&#8217;re seeing around it as well) in real-time, aka the speed of news. Normally, this\u00a0level of video quality is\u00a0only used\u00a0when working with CGI, but Otoy&#8217;s platform aims to let content creators of all sorts work with it.<\/p>\n<p>From a news coverage perspective, that could mean 360-view video that brings new life to &#8220;man on the ground&#8221; reporting. Or perhaps an enhanced virtual set where a news anchor is shown walking through a scene while talking, with graphics that illustrate something far better than a spoken explanation or static graphic. (CNN is quite a big fan of those drone camera shots, but that&#8217;s kind of all they are.)<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Once that video data is captured and uploaded into a computer, it can be manipulated almost like [photoshopping images],&#8221;\u00a0Urbach said, noting that current digital video editing tools usually require deep understanding to manipulate. &#8220;By making the workflow really fast and easy, it&#8217;s also going to satisfy partners that want to deliver content to many mediums in real-time.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The takeaway for me? Fewer top-down views from newscasts using Google Earth, and more video content that helps tell a richer story.<\/p>\n<p>As for what Stewart&#8217;s contract with HBO entails, it won&#8217;t be a regular talkshow-esque television show &#8212; at least not at first. Deadline\u00a0said Stewart will focus on short-form digital-first content as well as potential films and longer series.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After a short break concluding his legendary run on Comedy Central&#8217;s The Daily Show, former host Jon Stewart is heading to premium&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":402,"featured_media":799955,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359217992,359217645,3805589],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920648"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/402"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920648"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920648\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/799955"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920648"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920648"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920648"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":941035,"date":"2015-11-03T09:00:45","date_gmt":"2015-11-03T17:00:45","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/?p=248404"},"modified":"2015-11-03T09:00:45","modified_gmt":"2015-11-03T17:00:45","slug":"consumer-data-are-attitudes-about-sharing-with-brands-shifting","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/03\/consumer-data-are-attitudes-about-sharing-with-brands-shifting\/","title":{"rendered":"Consumer Data: Are Attitudes about Sharing with Brands Shifting?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>You don\u2019t have to have been an internet user fifteen years ago to know things were different then; it was the time of dial-up and buffering videos, when ecommerce was novel and social media had yet to lay its claim on our souls. Personal data was something to be guarded closely and so when ad platform DoubleClick purchased catalog data collection agency Abacus, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/privacy-advocates-rally-against-doubleclick-abacus-merger\/\">the first major privacy scandal<\/a> of the digital age erupted. Privacy advocates rallied against merging offline and online data and ultimately inspired a set of rules that would help safe-guard personally identifiable information (PII) from marketers.<\/p>\n<p>Fast forward 15+ years and behavioral and location targeting are standard fare in advertising. Marketers are using in-store transaction data to optimize digital retention programs and, conversely, gauging the success of online campaigns with in-store data. Yes\u2014they are marrying online with offline data, the same idea that ignited the milestone scandal. This widespread shift recently prompted privacy expert Allen Chappell to raise the <a href=\"http:\/\/adexchanger.com\/data-driven-thinking\/is-pii-still-the-third-rail-of-privacy-for-ad-tech\/\">question<\/a> whether or not it was time to revisit the controls put in place as a result of the DoubleClick\/Abacus deal.<\/p>\n<p>More intriguing is the fact that, unlike fifteen years ago, consumers are now freely and frequently sharing personal photos of their pets, homes and children, announcing political and religious views, medical conditions and their location online. They\u2019re surrendering personal information for the sake of learning what their zombie name would be, or what career they might have had had they been born left-handed. Is it possible that the tide against sharing has turned?<\/p>\n<p>A new study released by Columbia Business School and AIMIA investigates this. <a href=\"http:\/\/www8.gsb.columbia.edu\/globalbrands\/node\/148#overlay-context=research\/future-of-data-sharing\">\u201cWhat is the Future of Data Sharing: Consumer Mindsets and the Power of Brands<\/a>\u201d, authored by Matthew Quint and David Rogers, surveyed 8000 respondents across four generations (Millennials, Generation X, Baby Boomers and the Silent Generation) and five countries (US, UK, Canada, France and India) to gain insight into what, how, and why consumers are willing to share their personal data with companies.<\/p>\n<p>By examining attitudes around different kinds of data\u2014name, address, phone number, email, purchase history and lifestyle info\u2014the study showed that consumers are able to make distinctions between personally identifiable and other types of information, and that they understand sharing some data points makes them more vulnerable than others. However, even with this knowledge, 70% of those surveyed would still consider sharing that personal information. They offered a framework on which to better understand the range of attitudes around sharing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Data Sharing Mindset<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>By comparing respondents\u2019 level of defense and happiness about sharing, the study identified identified 4 \u201cdata-sharing mindsets\u201d.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/DataSharingMindsets_ColumbiaBusinessSchoolStudy.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-248405 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/DataSharingMindsets_ColumbiaBusinessSchoolStudy-804x449.png\" alt=\"DataSharingMindsets_ColumbiaBusinessSchoolStudy\" width=\"804\" height=\"449\" \/><\/a>\n<p>\u201cDefenders\u201d, or those that are unwilling to share data and\/or take defensive action against sharing (such as giving false information or making efforts to limit how they are tracked online) represent the largest of the four segments. Still, their active resistance leaves them in the minority; 67% of those surveyed were either willing to share data or, somewhat pessimistically, resigned to sharing it. While it didn\u2019t prevent consumers from sharing, that negative attitude toward sharing characterized the majority (66%) of respondents.<\/p>\n<p>So, essentially, consumers are sharing data even when they aren\u2019t necessarily \u201chappy\u201d about doing so. What, then, is driving this action?<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Motivation for Sharing Personal Data<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Naturally, trust plays a role here; 75% of those surveyed were more likely to share data with a brand they trust. The study presented a fairly optimistic view of the state of brand and consumer relations in that most of those surveyed acknowledged at least one brand they trusted across the six industries presented, including Financial Services, Retail and Airlines.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/BrandTrust_ColumbiaBusinessSchoolStudy.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-248406 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/11\/BrandTrust_ColumbiaBusinessSchoolStudy-804x446.png\" alt=\"BrandTrust_ColumbiaBusinessSchoolStudy\" width=\"804\" height=\"446\" \/><\/a>\n<p>Interestingly, Financial Services stood out as the industry for which most consumers identified a trusted brand, perhaps suggesting they believe that these companies are more conscientious when it comes to safeguarding the information with which they are entrusted.<\/p>\n<p>Another key factor is value. The study showed that offers have an influence on whether or not consumers shared data with brands, as well as what data they shared. An offer might entail signing up for a newsletter to get a discount, registering for a \u201cshopping club\u201d, joining a loyalty program, or gaining access to special events. Not surprisingly, financial incentives like cash back and discounts scored most effective. (In a sense, this becomes more of a barter than sharing. Along these lines, as authors Quint and Rogers noted, the World Economic Forum is researching personal data\u2019s potential as a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.weforum.org\/reports\/personal-data-emergence-new-asset-class\">new asset class<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>The study also recognized the trend toward \u201cnon-traditional, data-enabled benefits\u201d, such as Security, User Experience, Societal and Insight benefits. \u00a0Product recommendations, as offered by Netflix and Amazon, fall into this group. So do services like Mint and Billguard which, in their promise to support financial decisions, aggregate data that\u2019s more sensitive than your late night <em>Narcos <\/em>binge-viewing. And, any content marketer will find validation in the role that Insights play in acquiring customer data. (There is some irony in the fact that, among the non-traditional benefits that drive consumers to share their sensitive personal information, Security topped the list.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sharing is Not a Reflection of Comfort<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Despite a willingness to share, the survey reflects the general sense that consumers aren\u2019t comfortable with how companies handle their data. Even among Millennials who\u2014correlating to a recent <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nielsen.com\/us\/en\/insights\/news\/2015\/millennials-are-most-trusting-when-it-comes-to-advertising.html\">Nielsen survey<\/a>\u2014weighed in as the most trusting age group, only 51% felt comfortable with how companies handle data. And, across generations, the vast majority of those surveyed expressed the desire to have more information about the data companies collect (85%) and (86%) wanted greater control over that data. The study posits that \u201cdue to increasing attention drawn to data theft, loss and monitoring\u2026 many people with Happy Go Lucky or Resigned mindsets in the past would have become Savvy and In Control or Defenders.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The recent surge in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2015\/9\/18\/9351267\/ad-blockers-top-iphone-chart-downloads\">downloads of ad blocking<\/a> applications supports this. While the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adweek.com\/news\/technology\/iab-pivots-ad-blocking-and-issues-mea-culpa-we-messed-167583\">IAB<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/digiday.com\/publishers\/motivations-ad-block-users\/\">Digiday<\/a> have each noted the motivation for ad blockers is more about user experience than privacy, the act of downloading\u2014and even <em>paying <\/em>to download\u2014ad blockers demonstrates\u00a0that consumers are more aware of, and increasingly taking action against, unsatisfying relationship with brands online. This, in turn, puts brands on the defensive. What can they do to to make consumers more comfortable?<\/p>\n<p><strong>What the Future of Data Sharing Means for Brands <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Just because consumers share pictures of their family vacation on Facebook or pin their Thanksgiving dinner menu, brands shouldn\u2019t assume that they\u2019ll benefit from any general trend toward sharing. Instead, they need to focus on building trust, which means being transparent about their collection and use of data and respectful of consumers\u2019 fear and desire for control. This isn\u2019t groundbreaking stuff, and in broad strokes mirrors the guidelines that came into play some fifteen years ago.<\/p>\n<p>More exciting, however, is the opportunity to create data-enabled incentives that make sharing with brands worthwhile, and maybe even irresistible, to consumers. This is both compelling and challenging because, unlike the traditional email-for-discount exchange, the best expression of data-enabled incentives isn\u2019t one-size-fits-all. Some will be experiential and deeply tied to the product\u2014think of anyone who has easily surrendered their location to catch an Uber\u2014while others might be more complementary. For example, Saatchi\u2019s recent \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/adage.com\/article\/digital\/saatchi-launches-pet-matching-effort-nonprofit-group\/301106\/?\">Digital Pawprint<\/a>\u201d campaign aims to match users with their perfect pet by targeting banners based on digital behavior.<\/p>\n<p>Either way, brands are challenged to dig deeper. They must apply the insight they already have on audiences to construct worthwhile incentives that draw further insight and, ultimately, grow their business. By offering creative and value-driven benefits, supported by transparency and trust, brands can build a more meaningful exchange with consumers today. They\u2019ll also be better prepared for the next, bigger wave of data that\u2019s coming with our wearable and IoT future.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You don\u2019t have to have been an internet user fifteen years ago to know things were different then; it was the time&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87833663,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359235222,17359,68061,700013,175,18357,792127,2136],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/941035"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87833663"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=941035"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/941035\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=941035"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=941035"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=941035"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920644,"date":"2015-11-03T09:00:28","date_gmt":"2015-11-03T17:00:28","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920644"},"modified":"2015-11-03T08:48:31","modified_gmt":"2015-11-03T16:48:31","slug":"ario-crowdfunds-a-mood-enhancing-lamp-that-mimics-natural-lighting","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/11\/03\/ario-crowdfunds-a-mood-enhancing-lamp-that-mimics-natural-lighting\/","title":{"rendered":"Ario crowdfunds a mood-enhancing lamp that mimics natural lighting"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Winter can wreak havoc on a person&#8217;s internal clock.

A startup called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.arioliving.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Ario<\/a> wants to help those people with a smart lamp designed to emulate optimal sunlight and, potentially, keep the winter blues at bay.<\/p>\n<p>Ario has turned to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/arioliving\/ario-smart-lighting-better-health\" target=\"_blank\">Kickstarter<\/a> to help it realize that goal. The company wants to raise $50,000 through the campaign, and it plans to get the first lamps to backers by the end of 2016, after it works out any kinks in the manufacturing process. It has also raised an undisclosed amount of outside funding &#8212; the lamp&#8217;s existence doesn&#8217;t hinge on the success \u00a0of the Kickstarter campaign.<\/p>\n<p>The lamp itself boasts an Internet connection; LEDs that change their hue in accordance to the ideal sunlight patterns, as determined by the company; and on-device controls that mean anyone can use the product without having to fumble around with a smartphone application or dedicated remote control.

Instead, Ario will focus on the health of people who use the lamp as their primary light source.<\/p>\n<p>This means Ario has to be different from other smart lighting solutions. Those differences include directional lighting, which turns on the top or bottom of the device depending on the time of day, thus mimicking the sun&#8217;s position in the sky; automated systems which don&#8217;t require user input to function, making it easier for people to use the device without thinking; and limited coloring.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;With smart bulbs, you&#8217;re fundamentally changing how people interact with lighting, and it&#8217;s something that people will be excited about in the first two weeks and then stop using it because it can be hard or confusing,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Ario is\u00a0a totally different experience, and we&#8217;ve received amazing feedback from testers saying the lamp makes\u00a0it feel more like you&#8217;re living outside.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no doubt that lighting affects our health, and the idea that receiving the same exact light from a fixed point in the ceiling or in a lamp might be bad isn&#8217;t all that surprising. The question is whether or not people should buy Ario instead of other smart lighting systems trying to fill the same roles. (One of the most notable is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.com\/2015\/01\/smart-lamp-designed-fight-winter-blues\/\">Sunn<\/a>, which is made\u00a0to mimic its namesake solar orb.)<\/p>\n<p>Hoskins thinks Ario&#8217;s design could make people choose it over other options. It&#8217;s supposed to fade in the background, like the light bulbs people already own, but it&#8217;s also supposed to be much healthier than those other lights. Then there are all the features I listed above. The Kickstarter campaign is a way for the company to prove enough people want this product to come to market.<\/p>\n<p>Even if people don&#8217;t purchase the Ario, though, it&#8217;s worth thinking about how light affects our bodies and minds. Hell, we&#8217;ve <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1981\/06\/23\/science\/from-fertility-to-mood-sunlight-found-to-affect-human-biology.html?pagewanted=all\">known for decades<\/a> that light is important, yet we&#8217;ve\u00a0made few changes because of that knowledge. Whether it&#8217;s through Ario or through other products, it seems indoor lighting is overdue for an upgrade. It has to large an effect on us to ignore that.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Winter can wreak havoc on a person&#8217;s internal clock.

But the company is about more than comments &#8212; it&#8217;s about helping companies use the content generated by basically everyone who uses the Internet to suit their own goals. Today it&#8217;s announcing a new platform so it can do that better than in the past.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Brands now have to produce more content than they ever have in history,&#8221; says Livefyre chief executive Jordan Kretchmer. &#8220;If they want to engage their audience, if they want to build community around their sites and mobile apps and stores, they have to create content to do that.&#8221; But hiring a bunch of people to make that content can be expensive; user-generated content is a lot cheaper.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s where Livefyre comes in.\u00a0Kretchmer breaks Livefyre\u00a0down into four areas: discovering content from the social Web; organizing that content into manageable pieces; publishing that content to a website or social network; and then keeping an eye on how well that content performs after its publication. These used to be separate tools, but now they&#8217;re all lumped in with each other.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This has been the big product effort for the last nine months,&#8221; Kretchmer says. &#8220;As we grew as a company and started delivering on more value and pieces of functionality to more customers, we of course had to bring more pieces into our platform.&#8221; This became unwieldy, so the company has built a dashboard to tie everything together in a service anyone should be able to use.<\/p>\n<p>That dashboard presents data collected from many different sources. It then sorts through all that content, presents it to a worker given the soul-crushing job of reposting #brand related stuff to their company&#8217;s online properties, and allows them to publish it on their Facebook page or website or wherever. Why pay for\u00a0some original content when so many people are giving it away for free?<\/p>\n<p>There is, of course, the simple matter of getting the rights to that content. Livefyre has rights management baked in; all a brand has to do to use someone&#8217;s tweet, photo, or miscellaneous ramblings is ask for permission. If the person who made that piece of content agrees, the brand is able to do whatever they want with it, and it&#8217;s permanently stored on Livefyre&#8217;s cloud.<\/p>\n<p>Kretchmer says this was the number-one most requested feature from Livefyre&#8217;s customers. He assures me that content for which brands haven&#8217;t secured the rights will be deleted from the company&#8217;s cloud if a user deletes it from whatever service to which they shared it to begin with; if the rights to that content are handed over, however, they&#8217;ll remain available in perpetuity.<\/p>\n<p>All of which means that every Facebook post, Instagram photo, and Tweet can be used to promote whatever a company wants to get in front of its customers. The good news: They&#8217;ll have to ask permission first, provided those companies are using Livefyre. It ain&#8217;t much of a silver lining, but at least it&#8217;s something.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Livefyre is perhaps best known for powering the comments sections beneath an untold number of articles from across countless websites.

All of these changes make its service more welcoming to people who have only ever used Facebook as their primary social network.<\/p>\n<p>With today&#8217;s update, whenever someone wants to indicate their approval of a decent tweet or Vine, they&#8217;ll be asked to &#8220;like&#8221; it instead of being given the option of clicking the &#8220;Favorite&#8221; button. The intent is the same &#8212; it&#8217;s just that the name for\u00a0pressing that button, which is now a heart instead of a star, has received an update. (Basically, instead of seeing a star to favorite, you&#8217;ll now see a heart.)<\/p>\n<p>Periscope users\u00a0won&#8217;t notice a change. The live-streaming service has featured since its debut multi-colored hearts people send whenever they like what they see. Twitter believes that bringing these hearts to its other services (the main Twitter service and Vine) will make them easier for newcomers to understand.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You might like a lot of things, but not everything can be your\u00a0<i>favorite,&#8221; <\/i>Twitter&#8217;s Akarshan Kumar says in a blog post. &#8220;The heart, in contrast, is a universal symbol that resonates across languages, cultures, and time zones. The heart is more expressive, enabling you to convey a range of emotions and easily connect with people.\u00a0And in our tests, we found that people loved it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Kumar&#8217;s reasoning might be a little dramatic, but being a global service requires Twitter to find a symbol that everyone\u00a0can understand. And it doesn&#8217;t make sense for one Twitter app\u00a0to feature hearts while the others have stars. But there might be another reason for this change: Being more like Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>Changing the &#8220;favorite&#8221; to the &#8220;like&#8221; is another small way Facebook users could feel more welcome on Twitter. The language was confusing &#8212; a person really should only be able to have one &#8220;favorite&#8221; tweet at a time &#8212; and different from Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;like&#8221; merely for the sake of distancing Twitter from that service.<\/p>\n<p>Will it mean much in the long run? Not really. People will complain about the change at first, then they&#8217;ll use it the same way they used the &#8220;favorite&#8221; button, and then a whole bunch of Twitter users will never know that button existed. But even this small of a change could make Twitter a little more approachable.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We want to make Twitter easier and more rewarding to use,&#8221; Kumar says in his post, &#8220;and we know that at times the star could be confusing, especially to newcomers.&#8221; Now that itty-bitty barrier to entry has been bulldozed over.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Twitter has done away with the &#8220;favorite&#8221; button\u00a0in a move that signals yet more changes for the social network.

Both of those companies found success on the back of one title (&#8220;Farmville&#8221; and &#8220;Angry Birds&#8221;) and both faced varying <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/bw\/articles\/2013-06-04\/a-short-history-of-zyngas-rapid-decline\">degrees<\/a> of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2015\/10\/21\/rovio-redundancies-idUSL8N12L4VG20151021\">adversity<\/a> when those games fell out of favor.

Considering the complex and distributed nature of cloud-based platforms, security approaches that leverage identity seem to be the best fit. This is a fundamental shift in thinking, and in technology.<\/p>\n<p>Developers are finding that they have to work well with security systems, considering the rise of cloud computing, and the adoption of DevOps. In the cloud, security becomes systemic to the platform, as well as to the application. Developers need to focus on the best practices and technologies that drive security in the cloud.<\/p>\n<p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) approaches and solutions are increasing in popularity. However, the movement to identity-based solutions is not as easy as many technology providers describe. There is much for developers to learn, and more to change.<\/p>\n<p>While it\u2019s pretty easy to build new approaches to security in new applications that reside on the cloud, the more difficult aspect of IAM is to extend this security model to the traditional enterprise. Security should be consistent and systemic, which is lacking in most traditional enterprise applications. The security problem needs to be considered by developers right now, before a move to the cloud.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"it%e2%80%99s-all-iam\" >It\u2019s all IAM<\/h2>\n<p>IAM is clearly a superior security model and best practice, considering the emerging use of cloud computing, and it\u2019s a technology that will be most beneficial for developer requirements. Indeed, many cloud providers provide IAM as a service right out of the cloud.<\/p>\n<p>The IAM concept is simple: Provide a security approach and technology that enables the right individuals to access the right resources, at the right times, for the right reasons. IAM follows the principles that everything and everyone gets an identity. This includes humans, servers, APIs, applications, data, etc. Once that verification occurs, it\u2019s just a matter of defining which identities can access other identities, and creating policies that define the limits of that relationship.<\/p>\n<p>An example of IAM for developers would be to define and store the identity of a set of cloud-based Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that are only to be leveraged by a single set of IoT (Internet of Things) devices, let\u2019s say, thermostats. The APIs each have an identity, as do the devices, applications and the humans using the devices. They have to authenticate each other\u2019s identity before they are granted access, or grant access. Each checks with the IAM each time they interact with another resource, such as in the example of an application running on a device, linking to and invoking an API.<\/p>\n<p>An IAM provides much more control. In our simple example above, you could remove access to any resources by simply de-authorizing the relationship, using their identities and credentials as a way of determining who and what they are. Moreover, you can also set access policies, such as time of day, even geographical locations, as ways of limiting access around certain high-risk situations to better protect the assets that the IAM is securing.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"new-security-model-for-develop\" >New Security Model for Developers<\/h2>\n<p>We focused on IAM as we moved to more distributed and heterogeneous systems, which is exactly what cloud-based platforms are. Moreover, as security and compliance issues begin to become the number one priority, the investment in IAM is being made both within the enterprise, and certainly within the emerging using of public and private cloud-based systems.<\/p>\n<p>As you can see in Figure 1, in a 2013 Gigaom survey, security is often cited as the number one reason why enterprises are not moving to the cloud.<\/p>\n<p><em>Figure 1: Security is consistently cited as the number 1 reason why the enterprise is not moving to the cloud.<\/em><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/powermore.dell.com\/technology\/understanding-cloud-application-security-using-iam-a-developers-guide\/#_ftn1\"><sub>[1]<\/sub><br \/>\n<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<div class=\"image-module image-inline\"><img class=\"\" alt=\"\" \/><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While technology is not always the answer, the use of IAM could bring those who are on the fence around to the use of public clouds. In many instances, data is actually more secure in the cloud, when the right security models are leveraged. Indeed, according to Alert Logic\u2019s Fall 2012 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rackspace.com\/knowledge_center\/whitepaper\/alert-logic-state-of-cloud-security-report-spring-2012\" target=\"_blank\">State of the Cloud Security Report<\/a>, the variations in the threat activity are not as important as where the infrastructure is located.<\/p>\n<p>The report further finds that Web application-based attacks hit both service provider environments (53 percent of organizations) and on-premises environments (44 percent of organizations). However, on-premises environment users or customers actually suffer more incidents than those of service provider environments. On-premises environment users experienced an average of 61.4 attacks, while service provider environment customers averaged only 27.8. On-premises environment users also suffered significantly more brute force attacks compared to their counterparts.<\/p>\n<p>What is unique about IAM is that it\u2019s important as a business driver, as well as a security technology. Those who deploy IAM, including developers, need to focus on the core business processes, as well as the details around security. This is a shift from recent days, when security was more of a \u201cgeeky\u201d concept, and the business drivers were largely unconsidered. The focus on making security an application, versus a platform-level issues, draws developers in as well.<\/p>\n<p>Developers who build mature IAM capabilities into their systems can reduce their identity management costs and, more importantly, become significantly more agile in supporting new business initiatives. When security is built into the development processes, and not an afterthought, resulting applications provide more security and functionality. What\u2019s more, developers feel that they are empowered to make the security calls that they need, without having to rely on an outside security organization.<\/p>\n<p>It seems easy to predict that IAM will be part of more than 50 percent of the existing applications that migrate to the pubic cloud. What might be more surprising to some is that it will be part of almost 90 percent of new applications built on clouds.<sub><a href=\"https:\/\/powermore.dell.com\/technology\/understanding-cloud-application-security-using-iam-a-developers-guide\/#_ftn2\">[2]<\/a><\/sub> Will you be ready?<\/p>\n<p><em>This post was written as part of the Dell Insight Partners program, which provides news and analysis about the evolving world of tech.

This means it &#8220;could not &#8212; and do not &#8212; share [private images] with advertisers or business partners,&#8221; according to the company. Content\u00a0shared via Snapchat is just as ephemeral as it was before the updates.<\/p>\n<p>Snapchat explained in the\u00a0post that it changed the\u00a0policies to be more readable, to allow for in-app purchases like <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/09\/15\/snapchat-monetizes-a-feature-that-runs-counter-to-its-reason-for-being\/\">the counterintuitive Replays<\/a>, and to make users aware about the information they have given the service. These were\u00a0all routine updates tech companies make to their policies semi-regularly.<\/p>\n<p>The reaction to these updates was also routine. Just look at when Instagram updated its policies to make it clear that it planned to use photos shared to its service in advertisements. People started to lose their minds, but as the Verge&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2012\/12\/18\/3780158\/instagrams-new-terms-of-service-what-they-really-mean\">Nilay Patel<\/a> explained, the problem didn&#8217;t lie with the policies themselves. It lied with Instagram&#8217;s inability to explain them and a\u00a0lack of trust in Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>Snapchat could have learned from the Instagram debacle. Instead of posting something on its blog when people started to freak out, it could&#8217;ve published the same exact blog post when it first made the changes. That might&#8217;ve helped people understand exactly what the company intended with its new policies.<\/p>\n<p>There might be another problem: Making the policies readable to humans sounds good in theory, but in practice things could be just a little bit messier.<\/p>\n<p>Nobody can be expected to read through all the terms of service and privacy policies for everything they use. That would require far more time than anyone wants to spend when they&#8217;re setting up their iPhone, for example, or signing up for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2015\/nov\/02\/google-app-whos-down-friends-meet-up-android-iphone\">the newest social tool<\/a> for teens who want to indicate their down-ness.<\/p>\n<p>So we click the &#8220;agree&#8221; button without knowing what&#8217;s happening, content to keep ourselves from drowning in a flood of legalese. Even if we did read many of these policies, it would be hard to tell exactly what companies are allowed to do, mostly because the vast majority of us aren&#8217;t familiar with applicable laws.<\/p>\n<p>This is an obvious problem. Making policies and agreements easier to read is admirable. But when people realize exactly what they&#8217;re agreeing to, especially if those terms aren&#8217;t broken down like they are in Snapchat&#8217;s blog post, they&#8217;re likely to respond with the fear Snapchat&#8217;s users showed after these updates.<\/p>\n<p>It would be easier for tech companies to keep the legalese and prevent their users from ever understand what they&#8217;ve agreed to until scandal breaks out. The\u00a0companies are damned if their policies are inscrutable to normal people, and damned if they make them more readable but people misinterpret them.<\/p>\n<p>Snapchat has learned this the hard way. Some of the blame lies with the company &#8212; as I said, it could&#8217;ve saved itself a headache by publishing yesterday&#8217;s blog post earlier &#8212; but a lot of it lies with us for not knowing what we&#8217;ve agreed to in the past.

And when you look at the pure volume of content and consumer demand, it&#8217;s easy to see that Red is justifiably the sensible next step in the video service\u2019s evolution.<\/p>\n<p>The move to launch\u00a0YouTube Red, however, is also about a viewer&#8217;s preferences for how that content is consumed, according to\u00a0Juan Bruce, CEO of\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/epoxy.tv\/\" target=\"_blank\">Epoxy<\/a>, which helps YouTubers market and measure video\u00a0across social channels. \u201cEvery platform entering the video space gives viewers another option for how they want to interact with content, whether it\u2019s traditional YouTube, live streaming, a Vine feed, Facebook&#8217;s social experience or paid services.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also a potential cash cow, is it not? There\u2019s an OTT land grab right now, so why wouldn\u2019t the platform with (arguably) the most loyal video community on the web make a go of it?<\/p>\n<p>In addition to its <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/10\/21\/youtube-red-is-googles-master-plan-to-take-on-rival-media-subscriptions\/\" target=\"_blank\">new premium features<\/a>, Red will offer premium content, created specifically for the platform and available only through its service. Creators like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/TheFineBros\" target=\"_blank\">The Fine Bros<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube\/user\/pewdiepie\" target=\"_blank\">PewDiePie<\/a>,<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/joeygraceffa\" target=\"_blank\"> Joey Graceffa<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/IISuperwomanII\" target=\"_blank\">Lilly Singh<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/roosterteeth.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Rooster Teeth<\/a> are just a few of the individuals committed to creating original material for the newly launched service.<br \/>\nThe alleged draw of the new premium content from PewDiePie and others will be twofold: 1) the subscription revenue will help pay for content exclusively produced for Red customers; and 2) the content will be uninterrupted, or ad-free. The problem with the latter is can you truly call it uninterrupted ad-free content if you have native advertising involved?<\/p>\n<p>Call them native ads, brand sponsored content, or what you will, the point is, ads are pervasive and baked into the actual creative of so many top tier YouTube channels. Even the <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/09\/23\/watchwith-aims-to-help-tv-advertising-evolve-for-the-digital-era\/\" target=\"_blank\">TV industry is incorporating native ads in-program<\/a>, so are we to expect the YouTube market to change when it has been incorporating branded content into videos for years?<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"ad-free-threatens-youtubes%c2%\">&#8216;Ad-free&#8217; threatens YouTube&#8217;s\u00a0business model (and consumer trust)<\/h3>\n<p>The above calls into question two things: what does ad-free mean to creators and digital networks on YouTube who rely on brand deals? And, assuming YouTube doesn\u2019t bite the hand that feeds it, is Red really delivering consumers an ad-free service?<\/p>\n<p>Considering the economics of legacy YouTube &#8212; YouTube channel sponsorships, in-video brands integrations &#8212; there\u2019s a lot of questions surrounding how the existing native advertising model fits into a premium \u201cad-free\u201d YouTube subscription service. For YouTube creators and multi-channel networks (MCNs), integrating branded content natively in videos is a key revenue driver. In fact, we\u2019re seeing these types of branded integrations popping up all over the Internet &#8212; from the gaming industry and its <a href=\"http:\/\/adage.com\/article\/digital\/zynga-sell-sponsored-levels-created-house-agency\/300825\/\" target=\"_blank\">sponsored levels in Zynga<\/a> to the music industry and its branded pop-up stations like the <a href=\"http:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2015\/10\/20\/microsoft-partners-with-dj-skees-dash-radio-for-an-all-halo-music-station\/\" target=\"_blank\">Halo 5: Guardians station on Dash Radio<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Frank Sinton, CEO of <a href=\"http:\/\/beachfrontmedia.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Beachfront Media<\/a>, knows the industry intimately, having worked with\u00a0over\u00a0100 YouTubers to deploy apps across connected TVs and mobile phones. He points to a specific YouTube native advertising example from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/corycotton\" target=\"_blank\">Dude Perfect<\/a>, saying: \u201cThe ads in his content are part of the video. If it\u2019s supposed to be an ad-free platform, it should be completely. But how does that happen?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>YouTube is saying it\u2019s sharing new subscription revenue with creators, but what about brand deals? Where does YouTube stand on native brand integrations being a part of YouTube Red?<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s no need to guess. Google-owned YouTube already informed the market where it stands earlier in the\u00a0year. More specifically, it happened when <a href=\"http:\/\/digiday.com\/platforms\/youtube-moves-outside-overlay-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube made moves against brand-sponsored videos<\/a>, requiring creators and MCNs to work Google\u2019s sales team for deals.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"go-forth-and-question\">Go forth, and question<\/h3>\n<p>At an initial glance, the premium features of YouTube Red are enough to sway a portion of the population over to the subscription-based model. Especially with the promise of premium content from top creators in the not so distant future, but the term \u201cad-free\u201d has been brushed over, and applied to the platform without any real concrete details. With all of the new features YouTube Red is offering, it\u2019s definitely worth a shot, \u00a0just don\u2019t be disappointed when \u201cad-free\u201d turns out to be \u201cpre-roll ad free\u201d and a lot of branded content.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Zach is a media analyst at Fabric Media.

I\u2019m hardly alone in that; the average citizen of any connected country is an avid consumer, seeker, and sharer of information &#8212; driving over 5.7 billion Google searches each\u00a0day.\u00a0But what happens\u00a0when\u00a0you see something you can\u2019t describe? Or when you encounter something you can\u2019t accurately communicate to a friend, let alone a search engine?<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, the platforms and tools\u00a0of the current age of information\u00a0aren&#8217;t much help when trying to learn about . They restrict our ability to learn more about\u00a0things\u00a0we\u00a0cannot describe with words. And while the Internet has powered a new era of human networking and intelligence, the first information revolution fell short of realizing the potential of technology to provide us with the keys we need to fully unlock the world around us in any given moment. This isn&#8217;t a new development. Throughout history, our ability to express curiosity for the world around us has been limited only by the technology available.<\/p>\n<p>In today\u2019s age of information, mobile devices and global connectivity have brought an impressive amount of knowledge to our very fingertips. The Internet and powerful text search tools enabled us to discover nearly everything about anything we can describe with words &#8211; any text that can be typed into a search engine. But words cannot express the reality of the entire human experience. That said, for all our advancements, the human experience remains largely driven by sight, as it has for millennia. Unsurprisingly, eyeballs have always had a shorter path to the brain than any other sense. And, our ability to quickly derive information and make decisions based on visual data evolved far before our ability to understand language and invent the alphabet.<\/p>\n<p>When the\u00a0next information revolution\u00a0arrives, it\u00a0must then open the door to the physical, visual world and enable people to quickly discover contextual information about the objects and images around them. The future of discovery will be pointing at things we\u2019re curious about and learning relevant information without even having to ask a question. This revolution will transform how we access shared knowledge and impact nearly every aspect of our lives at home and in the workplace.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"revolution-is-coming-and-soon\">Revolution is coming, and soon.<\/h3>\n<p>Fortunately (and excitingly), this revolution is\u00a0going to happen much more quickly than many realize. New technologies like image recognition, wearable hardware, machine learning, and augmented\/virtual reality have created an ecosystem capable of\u00a0bringing us closer to a world in which information isn\u2019t just at our fingertips, but accessible through every shape and form around us.<\/p>\n<p>This is the \u201cInternet <em>on<\/em> Things\u201d &#8212; an environment in which information is autonomously accessed in real-time, immediately upon encountering and interacting with something in the world. Unlike the often referenced\u00a0&#8220;Internet of Things,&#8221; technology from the Internet <em>on<\/em> Things isn\u2019t embedded within an object. Instead, the object itself is the key that allows another platform to find and deliver associated data, unlocking relevant information and experiences.<\/p>\n<p>The potential applications for such technology are undoubtedly exciting. But are we ready? A revolution, after all, is inherently disruptive &#8212; in the truest sense of the word, not the buzzword bandied about today\u2019s tech community. While the Internet on Things will undoubtedly have a positive, transformative effect on the lives of average consumers, it will pull the rug out from under a range of established companies and create new business practices in virtually every industry.<\/p>\n<p>To get a sense of the far-ranging implications of a new information revolution, we can consider the massive shift the search business drove in the wake of mainstream Internet adoption. As PCs became cheaper and connectivity improved, millions of consumers needed a better way to access the wealth of information that was now available within their homes and offices. In meeting that need, the search industry established the infrastructure that is today continuing to disrupt everything from print advertising to brick &amp; mortar retail.<\/p>\n<p>The best example of the long-term ramifications of an information revolution is, of course, Google.<\/p>\n<p>Google is a microcosm of innovation and disruption. The company took advantage of a vast \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.blueoceanstrategy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Ocean<\/a>\u201d opportunity created by new technologies and changing consumer preferences, and rode a tidal wave of change that let it grab an increasingly large share of the technology industry at large. Today that includes long-term ripples of the first information revolution, such as\u00a0YouTube, drones, and self-driving cars.<\/p>\n<p>Putting aside the potential for a &#8220;new Google&#8221; to hatch in the wake of the next\u00a0information revolution (one that would\u00a0further transform advertising, e-commerce and more), the Internet <em>on<\/em> Things will also cause disruption through the infrastructure required to support it.<\/p>\n<p>Powering this new model will mean indexing all of the world\u2019s visual data &#8212; every object and image &#8212; and building machines smart enough to return the right, context-sensitive information to an end user. This will require massive investments in technology &#8212; both software and hardware &#8212; and will be the first barrier for companies seeking to exploit this dynamic space.<\/p>\n<p>There are enormous opportunities on the horizon, but they come alongside a host of challenges. Today we stand on the cusp of a revolution that will reimagine how we interact with the physical world and disrupt industries in every market across the globe.

The survey found that U.S. Millennials as a generalized group (those born between 1984 to 1997) are financially stuck \u2013 they have bank accounts, but are swimming in student debt and thus have no money to spend on investments and the extras after food and rent. Not surprisingly, most <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/fact-tank\/2014\/03\/07\/6-new-findings-about-millennials\/\">Millennials do not believe that what savings they have \u2013 mandatory\u00a0Social Security contributions \u2013 will actually materialize for them in retirement<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>And as indicated by such emerging social constructs as the post-college group house, Millennials are essentially stuck in the bottom tiers of the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.simplypsychology.org\/maslow.html\">needs pyramid<\/a> &#8212; not only can\u2019t they save for big purchases, but they are also postponing milestone life events such as getting a place of one\u2019s own, marriage and family.<\/p>\n<p>Ergo you could say that millennials \u2013 even more so than the capitalist generation before them (i.e. the wolves of Wall Street) \u2013 are obsessed with money. And how it holds them back.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, Millennials are very facile with their mobile financial apps and rely heavily on them for financial information, services and purchase decisioning. They may have big brand bank accounts, but to them the brick and mortar branch, the ATM, even physical money\u2013 are becoming less relevant.<\/p>\n<p>All the above lays the groundwork for continued massive disruption in financial services as Millennials fixate and act on their [lack of] money obsession and the status quo education and financial systems that have\u00a0l<a href=\"http:\/\/www.pewsocialtrends.org\/2015\/07\/29\/more-millennials-living-with-family-despite-improved-job-market\/\">iterally left them living in their parents\u2019 basements<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>And thus driven by the financially disenfranchised (but still optimistic) Millennials, a new FinTech Renaissance is emerging. From alternative methods of lending like SoFi ($1 billion capital raised in Sept. 2015 to help consumers refinance their student loans) to services focused on helping consumers to understand and take control of their credit scores (Credit Karma raised $175 million in June 2015), to bitcoin and other cryptocurrency technology that represent a new payment rail and partial replacement for fiat (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/bitcoin-venture-capital\/\">$1 billion+ investment in 2015<\/a>\u00a0with blockchain development companies like Chain raising $30 million), Millennials are taking down \u2013 or at least making less relevant &#8212; the traditional financial power structure one sector at a time.<\/p>\n<p>Over the course of the next year, we\u2019ll take a look at some of the emerging financial services disruptors and trends coming out of\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/bankinnovation.net\/2015\/08\/26-of-y-combinator-batch-is-fintech-2x-other-good-fintech-vintages\">Y-Combinato<\/a>r and other incubators and launchpads such as\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.herocity.com\/fintech-about\/\">Draper FinTech Connection<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/plugandplayaccelerator.com\/fintech\">Plug and Play&#8217;s Fintech Accelerator<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of the more enlightening sessions at this year\u2019s Money 20\/20 payment industry conference (9,000+ attendees) featured new findings from a\u00a0Foundation Capital&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87725674,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359235209,291633127,5827,51541356,359217750,216504,1028815,172678,359235219,359215982],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/941033"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87725674"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=941033"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/941033\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=941033"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=941033"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=941033"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920627,"date":"2015-10-30T07:58:45","date_gmt":"2015-10-30T14:58:45","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920627"},"modified":"2015-10-30T07:58:45","modified_gmt":"2015-10-30T14:58:45","slug":"turning-bookshelves-into-playlists-book-app-shelfie-gets-social","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/10\/30\/turning-bookshelves-into-playlists-book-app-shelfie-gets-social\/","title":{"rendered":"Turning bookshelves into playlists: Book app &#8216;Shelfie&#8217; gets\u00a0social"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>The vast majority of physical books I own are mostly only good for collecting dust once I&#8217;ve finished reading them.\u00a0Despite that, I&#8217;m happy to devote\u00a0space for them to sit on bookshelves in my office &#8212; except of course when I&#8217;m traveling and\u00a0wish I could add a few of them to my tablet without re-purchasing at full-price.<\/p>\n<p>The solution to this problem, according to Vancouver-based startup <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shelfie.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Shelfie<\/a>, is to snap a photo of each shelf and\u00a0allow its mobile app to automatically identify all the titles available as ebooks &#8212; some of which can be purchased within the app at a deeply discounted rate (81 percent on average).

Now when you snap a\u00a0bookshelf photo, it can be shared to a public feed on Shelfie. Other Shelfie users can follow your activity and vice versa. You can also rate books, or just share when you&#8217;ve added a new one to you library. Clicking on a book title gives you some info about it, and provides a list of other folks that also own or have read it. Overall, the new social features are pretty standard, but perhaps the most\u00a0valuable aspect is that you&#8217;re bridging the divide between your print and digital bookshelves.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Essentially, what we&#8217;re doing is transforming bookshelves into playlists, adding that element of socialization to books that helps uncover those hidden gems,&#8221; Shelfie cofounder and CEO Peter Hudson said in an interview with Gigaom. &#8220;A shelf of books says a lot about what you like to read. We wanted to make that more accessible to the world.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_920630\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Warren-Ellis-Shelfie.png\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-920630\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Warren-Ellis-Shelfie-300x169.png\" alt=\"My &quot;Shelfie&quot; devoted to Warren Ellis.\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" data-attribution=\"Tom Cheredar\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Warren-Ellis-Shelfie-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Warren-Ellis-Shelfie-804x453.png 804w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Warren-Ellis-Shelfie-968x545.png 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Warren-Ellis-Shelfie-210x118.png 210w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Warren-Ellis-Shelfie-320x180.png 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Warren-Ellis-Shelfie-640x361.png 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Warren-Ellis-Shelfie.png 1136w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">My &#8220;Shelfie&#8221; devoted to Warren Ellis.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Theoretically, Hudson makes a good point. I&#8217;d imagine most people organize\u00a0their bookshelves with some degree of methodology. For instance, I have an entire shelf dedicated to author Warren Ellis, and it would make sense for\u00a0folks with similar tastes to\u00a0discover a little-known Ellis title upon viewing my &#8220;Shelfie&#8221; photo. Then again, I also have nearly an entire shelf devoted to stuff I haven&#8217;t gotten around to reading yet, which\u00a0isn&#8217;t obvious upon casual glance and may\u00a0prove useless to strangers.<\/p>\n<p>Although Shelfie generates revenue from referral fees for business it sends to outside sellers like Apple&#8217;s iBookstore or Amazon, Hudson explained that the startup\u00a0isn&#8217;t\u00a0competing with well-known players\u00a0like GoodReads (even allowing new users to sign up with their GoodReads account),\u00a0which is focused on detailed book reviews and\u00a0discussion. The reason, he\u00a0added, is because reviews are a good way to drive book sales, or for those\u00a0looking for thoughtful analysis of a particular title. Yet, they aren&#8217;t\u00a0great at &#8220;socializing books.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Shelfie also isn&#8217;t concerned about competition from\u00a0unlimited ebook subscription services such as Scribd or Kindle Unlimited, nor does Hudson believe business strategy of those unlimited services to be favorable to the readers themselves.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s\u00a0the gym membership model.\u00a0It&#8217;s great, as long as no one comes. Gyms make money\u00a0because people sign up\u00a0for a membership January 1, go three times, then never go back but forget to cancel their subscription,&#8221; Hudson explained. &#8220;Everything works really well so long as people only read two books a month. The problem is, the people who converted (to unlimited subscriptions) read way more than that because it makes economic sense to them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>One way subscription services compensate for the increased licensing costs is to surface lesser-known, or self-published books that have\u00a0lower licensing fees, Hudson said. &#8220;When you think about the economic model for something like Scribd, they actually don&#8217;t want to push the good stuff to you, because those are books from the big publishers that cost the most.&#8221;\u00a0Such a practice would\u00a0obviously\u00a0makes it harder to find something you want to read.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The other challenge for unlimited subscriptions\u00a0is that there&#8217;s no effective way to browse online (that compares with a physical store). Everyone&#8217;s done it. You defocus your eyes a bit while\u00a0wandering down the aisles of a bookstore until something jumps out at you to stop and dig in. That experience doesn&#8217;t exist online. You can put about four book covers up on a tablet screen. Any more than that and it becomes too small to read the text, the detail of the artwork.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The takeaway, from Shelfie&#8217;s perspective anyway, is that people will be buying physical books for a long time despite the availability of digital versions. That, and people want options for how to read the book they own, which the startup is happy to oblige.<\/p>\n<p>The new social tools are a huge portion of Shelfie&#8217;s strategy for success, but ebook sales are still at the forefront. However, now people have a reason to stay active on Shelfie while it signs more publishers (it already has agreements with 750, including two of the &#8220;big 5,&#8221; MacMillan and HarperCollins). Additionally, my old books are finally\u00a0doing more than accumulating dust.<\/p>\n<p><em>* Lack of selection due to licensing is the biggest culprit, but the process of converting print to digital is also kind of a pain. To get a discounted ebook version, you have to prove you own the print book by snapping photos of a book&#8217;s\u00a0barcode, cover art, and copyright page with your handwritten name in all caps. Although, considering you&#8217;re getting the ebook version so cheap\u00a0(or free), it does seem worth it to jump through\u00a0hoops.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The vast majority of physical books I own are mostly only good for collecting dust once I&#8217;ve finished reading them.\u00a0Despite that, I&#8217;m&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":402,"featured_media":920628,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359215975,359216609,359234088,359234087],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920627"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/402"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920627"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920627\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920628"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920627"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920627"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920627"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":941036,"date":"2015-10-29T17:20:20","date_gmt":"2015-10-30T00:20:20","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/?p=248381"},"modified":"2016-02-25T13:24:33","modified_gmt":"2016-02-25T21:24:33","slug":"as-byod-becomes-standard-will-we-see-byomessaging","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/10\/29\/as-byod-becomes-standard-will-we-see-byomessaging\/","title":{"rendered":"As BYOD becomes standard will we see BYOMessaging?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>There are approximately 2 billion smartphone users in the world today. On those devices, there are 3.8 billion active monthly users of one of the top ten over the top messaging service. <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Statista-graph-ott-messaging-users.png\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-248384 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Statista-graph-ott-messaging-users.png\" alt=\"Statista graph ott messaging users\" width=\"600\" \/><\/a>On top of that we have core SMS and iMessages as well, as well as consumer and enterprise email (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.emailmonday.com\/mobile-email-usage-statistics\">half of all emails<\/a> are opened on mobile devices). It seems reasonable to estimate that a typical user is working with at least 4 messaging solutions in a given month. Despite that we are continuing to see innovation and new offerings, and a renewed focused on enterprise messaging.<\/p>\n<p>Samsung\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.samsungknox.com\/en\/blog\/knox-message-open-beta-has-launched\">recent announcement<\/a> about the opening of the beta of their Knox messaging service brings them into this space with an enterprise offering, built on their mobile security platform. As we noted in the <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1LOqXzs\">first post<\/a> in this sponsored series building security into features after the fact is a real challenge. Knox, Samsung\u2019s security platform, is well supported by Good and others, but there seems some real rationale in having messaging being part of the containerized secure solution. Historically, once SMS became a key feature, messaging was very much a core part of a mobile operating system, though OTT messaging has to some extent broken that linkage.<\/p>\n<p>Only one of the top ten messaging services is from a device manufacturer- why is Samsung entering this space? It took some for device manufacturers to enter this area. One of the usual explanations for that is that SMS was a cash cow for one of the device manufacturers\u2019 main channels (the operators), so it wasn\u2019t obvious that those operators would be willing to support this. It was a classic Innovator\u2019s Dilemma (though to be precise the carriers couldn\u2019t really be said to be the innovators here- Nokia has a better claim to be the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slashgear.com\/sms-turns-20-years-old-today-inventor-does-interview-over-text-messaging-03259299\/\">originator<\/a> of SMS than any carrier, but it was clearly the carriers who claimed the lion\u2019s share of the value). Perhaps as important is that OTT messaging services require a service provider type infrastructure (or a pure peer-to-peer type solution). For many years Blackberry was the only integrated provider here with their BBM service. It takes quite different skills to manage cloud based services, especially ones which have multiple end clients and many different geographies.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time that OTT messaging has become standard, BYOD (bring your own device) is also increasingly supported by businesses. Will BYOMessaging follow? Why not just Facebook message my colleague? One of the key aspects of messaging systems is identity. &#69;d&#100;&#121;&#64;h&#111;t&#109;&#97;i&#108;.c&#111;m might well be the same person as e&#115;imn&#101;&#116;&#116;&#64;&#109;&#105;c&#114;o&#115;of&#116;.c&#111;&#109; but proving that, and enabling people to find each other requires systems to manage identity. In regulated environments this is even more important. It is as, if not more, important as any single messaging feature that the solution be tightly linked to the business identity system.<\/p>\n<p>Security and messaging logging are also extremely important here. The early design promise of what has become Skype for Business was around secure enterprise messaging on the PC, especially for finance. As mobile becomes the default working mode for more and more people and businesses securing mobile messages has become critical- \u201cin today\u2019s world mobile is an inescapable interface for collaborative communications,\u201d said Barry Castle, CMO of <a href=\"https:\/\/symphony.com\/\">Symphony Communications<\/a>, a secure messaging and productivity company, backed by 18 buy- and sell-side financial services companies who are deploying and using the service today.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/samsung-multi-platform-graphic.png\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-248383 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/samsung-multi-platform-graphic-300x232.png\" alt=\"samsung multi platform graphic\" width=\"300\" height=\"232\" \/><\/a>To be enterprise-ready a solution also needs to be cross platform, and realistically cross device platform. There is more to this than simply providing multiple clients- having messages sync across devices, from mobile to PC to tablet and web, is going to be critical for usability.<\/p>\n<p>For many businesses it is also important that messaging, whether independent or part of the mobile OS, integrates with third party applications, and not just enterprise mobile management solutions. Mobile is the way users work today, so making sure mobile business apps integrate with business communications is going to be critical to ensuring individual users, as well as their managers and Chief Security Officers, are getting value from the solutions.

From first forays by the main mobile players (Google, Apple and Samsung) as well as payment providers such as PayPal, online services including Facebook and, indeed, financial institutions in preceding years, it was the <a href=\"http:\/\/smbz.us\/1iPPSaL\">incorporation of Near-Field Communications (NFC)<\/a> into payment readers that released the flood.<\/p>\n<p>The precedent has been set with contactless cards. Quite suddenly, it appears, people are moving from adamantly swiping and pushing their credit, debit and cards across and into readers, to looking confused and even frustrated if hovering an NFC-enabled card across a machine does not immediately result in a transaction. It is only a short step for the same to be done with a smart device, a phenomenon that is also moving from exception to norm.<\/p>\n<p>This is not the place to get into the plusses and minuses of the different mobile payment devices and platforms \u2014 sites such as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tomsguide.com\/us\/mobile-wallet-guide,news-20666.html\">Tom\u2019s Hardware<\/a> have done an extensive job already. Though it is worth mentioning that Samsung has the benefit of offering MST (magnetic stripe technology) as well as NFC. To the lay person, this means that cards will be able to be used on traditional \u2018swipe\u2019 readers which widens the market considerably.<\/p>\n<p>It is, however, worth comparing mobile payments with the traditional alternative, which is plastic. Smart device-based payments have the advantage of being just that: if a device can connect to the Internet and perform ancillary processing, this means the resulting transactions <a href=\"http:\/\/smbz.us\/1WlrIBz\">can also be smarter<\/a>. For example, this enables security tokens to be generated on the fly on a per-transaction basis, creating a closed loop which makes fraud more difficult than with traditional cards.<\/p>\n<p>It also means more straightforward recourse in the event of problems. If you forget your PIN for example, the traditional model means you may wait several days for a replacement. By post. With smartphones equipped with fingerprint recognition and other authentication, PIN problems become a thing of the past. Such smartphones also have greater protection against theft or loss; it is perhaps only a matter of time for an enterprising insurance company to offer a 24-hour global replacement service, onto which an entire mobile wallet can be restored from the cloud.<\/p>\n<p>Mobile payments are highly popular in many parts of the developing world, even for people who do not have bank accounts (and who make use of \u2018currency\u2019 based on mobile phone top-ups). Right now the majority of mobile devices in emerging economies are traditional handsets, but as this picture looks set to change dramatically over the next 5-10 years as mobile internet growth follows the same path as mobile telephony.<\/p>\n<p>While it is likely that we are at the beginning of the end for wallets stuffed with plastic cards, we are still at the start of mainstream adoption. Geographic roll-outs are still underway and mobile payments currently only work with smaller transaction sizes but no reason exists why things should stay this way as people, and indeed providers, become more comfortable with the technology. Already it seems strange that I can use my phone, via a banking app, to conduct quite sizeable transactions, yet until recently I couldn\u2019t buy a coffee without hard cash.<\/p>\n<p>The bottom line is, we are starting to feel the vibrations of a seismic change in the way we transact. As we make more use of our mobiles for financial transactions, it becomes highly likely that we will see new models emerge, such as exchange of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. For now we simply have to get used to the fact that the highly valuable, yet all too fragile piece of plastic upon which we all currently depend will soon be assigned to the past.<\/p>\n<p><!-- short URL for promotion: http:\/\/bit.ly\/1XCyeGx --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>2015 will go down in history as the year in which mobile payments became mainstream.

While the devices are still available right now, they&#8217;re scheduled to be pulled at some point today, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-10-01\/amazon-will-ban-sale-of-apple-google-video-streaming-devices\">Bloomberg&#8217;s\u00a0initial report<\/a> on Amazon&#8217;s plans.<\/p>\n<p>So why is Amazon doing this? Well, the company would have you believe that it&#8217;s trying to prevent consumer confusion, because neither of those competitive devices support its Prime Video service as well as its own Fire TV set-top boxes. But several reports published over the last few days offer an alternative theory.<\/p>\n<p>First came a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.geekwire.com\/2015\/exclusive-amazon-brings-e-commerce-to-fire-tv-and-prepares-to-launch-its-own-shopping-channel\/\">GeekWire report<\/a> about Amazon&#8217;s apparent plans to introduce a QVC-like channel to the Fire TV. This shopping network would complement a new feature\u00a0the company is reportedly testing with a small number of users: The ability to purchase items shown on-screen directly via the Fire TV remote.<\/p>\n<p>The report says\u00a0that Amazon wants to sell items via banner ads shown on the main Fire TV interface, and through the X-Ray feature, which uses Amazon&#8217;s IMDb service to share information about whatever a person is watching. (It can identify actors, for example, or share background info about a scene.)<\/p>\n<p>These shopping features wouldn&#8217;t be as easy to implement on competitive products. Nor would Amazon make as much money from them &#8212; Apple takes a 30 percent cut from all transactions made through its platforms, which is why Kindle users can&#8217;t purchase new books via the company&#8217;s iOS applications.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a compelling enough reason not to believe Amazon&#8217;s claim on its own. Saying it was trying to help its Prime customers was likely disingenuous; it seems more like Amazon is trying to do its best to promote a potential revenue scheme than like it was trying to make sure its most loyal customers are happy.<\/p>\n<p>Then came the revelation, courtesy of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/johnpaczkowski\/the-apple-tv-youve-always-wanted-is-finally-here#.yeQ8m1qYy\">BuzzFeed&#8217;s review<\/a> of the new Apple TV, that Amazon could very well introduce its Prime Video service to the platform.

Right now it seems damning. If the company can introduce Prime Video to the Apple TV, wouldn&#8217;t the customers it&#8217;s trying to save\u00a0from befuddlement be better served if it did that, instead of pulling from its website\u00a0a device they might want to purchase?<\/p>\n<p>None of this will really\u00a0stop people from buying a new Apple TV. Like I <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/10\/05\/amazon-will-stop-selling-apple-tvs-and-chromecasts-so-what\/\">wrote when Amazon&#8217;s plan <\/a>was revealed: The company isn&#8217;t hurting anyone but itself, given the ease with which someone can point their Web browser to Apple&#8217;s website instead of refusing to buy something not on Amazon&#8217;s market.

GE has put the industrial internet at the center of its future, most recently <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/10\/07\/ge-current\/\">exemplified<\/a> with its $1 billion new energy business dubbed Current. In September IBM <a href=\"http:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/2015\/09\/monthly-update-the-internet-of-things-and-networks-of-everything\/\">officially launched<\/a> its new IoT unit after it made a $3 billion IoT commitment in March. And Salesforce <a href=\"http:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/company\/news-press\/press-releases\/2015\/09\/150915-2.jsp\">recently unveiled<\/a> its IoT Cloud that will leverage Thunder, its realtime event processing engine.<\/p>\n<p>But one company that is particularly interesting on the enterprise end of IoT is Amazon, most notably because it is going after IoT from both an ecommerce consumer facing angle and from an enterprise cloud strategy. The fact that Amazon is so unique in being both a cloud provider and a consumer e-retailer gives it a unique understanding of the design demands in an IoT software platform\u00a0\u00a0as well as the types of cloud services businesses\u00a0need.<\/p>\n<p>October opened with Amazon <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/10\/01\/amazon-dash-internet-of-things\/?xid=soc_socialflow_twitter_FORTUNE\">announcing the expansion<\/a> of its Dash service. Amazon initially rolled out Dash earlier this year, a simple button consumers can attach to products like coffee makers or the garbage. Synced with their smart phone, when pressed, the button automatically orders coffee or garbage bags. It\u2019s one more play from\u00a0Amazon&#8217;s effort to take\u00a0market share from grocery retailers.<\/p>\n<p>But what was interesting about the newly announced expansion is that the goal is to leverage sensors in order to eliminate the need for the consumer to press anything. Sensors in a washing machine or a printer will automatically measure supply levels and communicate reorders to Amazon when needed. The strategy is a fairly elegant implementation of using sensor technology in consumer IoT so that purchasing behavior essentially is governed more by machines and less by humans.<\/p>\n<p>Will there be human pushback from say, folks who dislike machines buying products for them? Sure, there will be. But trust will likely grow and with less price sensitive customers or those who are very busy and are growing accustomed to not having to physically go to the grocery store, this program is just an extension of a behavioral trend. In a nutshell, more and more people don\u2019t want to shop anymore. We\u2019ve seen that occur in the physical retail context but with the expansion of Amazon Dash, the company is arguing that the trend may now apply to ecommerce as well.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon has also been working the IoT angle on the enterprise side. At AWS re:Invent in early October\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/iot\/\">it announced<\/a> the launch of AWS IoT. AWS IoT will provide SDKs to allow product developers to easily connect to the cloud, offer network capabilities to connect to cloud applications, certification for device identification and encryption, and interoperability with AWS analytics tools. It includes a rules engine that, in coordination with content and context aware data, opens up the possibility of automated responses across the AWS application platform. This is critical because in successful IoT, applications need to automatically respond to sensor data.<\/p>\n<p>In March Amazon <a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/03\/12\/amazon-has-quietly-acquired-2lemetry-to-build-out-its-internet-of-things-strategy\/#.xdzakl:Wut6\">acquired<\/a> 2lemetry, a Colorado startup that had an enterprise focused platform for tracking and managing IP-enabled devices. So it\u2019s not entirely shocking that AWS has quickly rolled out a dedicated IoT platform service.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a lot of hype right now in the world of IoT, though I believe that long term these investments will pay off. For enterprise customers currently moving to the cloud, a consideration over the next 3-5 years will always be whether to add connectivity to their physical product lines. For example, if Whirlpool is moving its IT operations to the cloud, they may well consider also using a service like AWS IoT for a connected washing machine provided the tool is mature enough. The other major consideration is whether there\u2019s added value in keeping the IoT platform in the same ecosystem as other cloud services.<\/p>\n<p>The IoT platform market is getting competitive, where every big IT player from IBM to GE is rolling out their own IoT offering in addition to the startups like Arrayent and Electric Imp. I\u2019m expecting a consolidation over the next 18-24 months, and the critical question will be whether the big IT giants can leverage their customer relationships to sell add-on IoT services or whether the specialized focus of startups will pay off. Many of the IoT platform providers that are smaller have been laser focused on connecting point devices, managing back end cloud services, making data available for third party analytics, and even dealing with hardware module design.<\/p>\n<p>In reality, many of the early platform providers are consumer focused and the GE and AWS\u2019s of the world will be going after the enterprise. Still, there\u2019s inevitable overlap and many of the early consumer facing IoT platform providers chose consumer IoT as an easy and near term revenue strategy while setting their sites on longer term revenue available from big enterprise customers.<\/p>\n<p>Device proliferation continues and whether we\u2019re talking about AWS IoT or Google\u2019s recently announced Brillo operating system for IoT, the core realization in big IoT is that they want to control the software that both end consumers and large enterprises use to interact with all of their devices. That was always a seemingly easier proposition when we were talking about one smart phone or tablet.<\/p>\n<p>But now we\u2019re talking about multiple devices that are sensor enabled. It\u2019s a big, complicated undertaking. But given how much people\u2019s lives and behavior are being driven by the devices in their lives as well as the fact that in many respects the software spans from the consumer to the enterprise, it\u2019s a market big IT feels is worth fighting for.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If I look back at the last 18 months in IoT, I see a period where big IT has gotten serious about&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87621237,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/941038"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87621237"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=941038"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/941038\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=941038"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=941038"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=941038"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920622,"date":"2015-10-28T14:29:37","date_gmt":"2015-10-28T21:29:37","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920622"},"modified":"2015-10-28T14:29:37","modified_gmt":"2015-10-28T21:29:37","slug":"facebook-changes-ios-share-sheet-announces-f8-2016-dates","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/10\/28\/facebook-changes-ios-share-sheet-announces-f8-2016-dates\/","title":{"rendered":"Facebook changes iOS share sheet, announces F8 2016 dates"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.facebook.com\/blog\/post\/2015\/10\/28\/new-fbstart-partners-new-way-to-share\/\">has announced that<\/a> members of FbStart, a program devoted to helping early-stage startups, have received more than $250 million in benefits since the program was introduced during its developer conference in 2014.<\/p>\n<p>The program is supposed to help startups by giving them free access to products from Facebook&#8217;s partners; offering guidance from people inside the social network; and providing a network of startups that can help each other.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook says more than 7,200 startups across 130 countries have signed up for the program.

And when do people who seem to know about wine find time for all of this stuff?<\/p>\n<p>Some people are inclined to answer all those questions. (Carefully, it&#8217;s an Italian wine, and stuffed into the crevices in their lives like the bottles they have stashed in every nook and cranny in their homes.)

You know how Netflix recommends movies based on the ratings you give to films you&#8217;ve already seen? Wine Ring is like that, but for fermented grape juice.<\/p>\n<p>There are a slew of other wine-related apps available:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/delectable.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Delectable<\/a> is basically a social network where wine lovers don&#8217;t have to worry about being called snobs by their <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/why-trader-joes-wine-is-so-cheap-2015-7\" target=\"_blank\">Two-Buck Chuck<\/a>-guzzling friends, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vivino.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Vivino<\/a> is a cellar management tool and\u00a0a rating system, review app <a href=\"http:\/\/corkz.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Corkz<\/a>, wine search service\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/plonk\/id644898155?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">Plonk<\/a>, and so on and so forth. Wine Ring aims to be different.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Wine Ring\u2019s technology is fundamentally different from any other wine app, and for that matter any consumer app,&#8221; says Pam Dillon, the company&#8217;s chief executive.\u00a0&#8220;We\u2019ve solved the problem of consumer preference, and can deliver a whole range of novel recommendation functionalities either in the context of the world of wine, or on an inventory-specific basis.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The company has been granted several patents for the systems it has developed to power its app, and Dillon says it will make its money by selling aggregate data to retailers and restaurateurs. The idea is that businesses will learn more about wine drinkers, which will help\u00a0them sell more wine, at least in theory.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The entire wine industry supply chain \u2013 producers, importers, distributers, retailers and restaurateurs \u2013 knows what is bought and sold, but it doesn\u2019t know what is preferred, and in what market it is preferred,&#8221; Dillon says. &#8220;Aggregate preference data creates the opportunity for much more efficient production, and much happier consumers.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not convinced Wine Ring will lead to reputable producers or importers changing their decisions, nor that they should. Part of wine&#8217;s appeal is that the best examples are true to where the grapes that were sacrificed to make it were grown. Some people like manufactured, reliable wines; others like the variety that makes every wine, or indeed every bottle, different from its shelf-mates.<\/p>\n<p>That might be the thing that makes me most skeptical about Wine Ring, actually. Recommending a wine is hard, and because there can be significant amounts of bottle variation, even a single wine can defy expectations. (Hence &#8220;There are no great old wines, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bottle_variation\">only great bottles.<\/a>&#8221; You can nix the &#8220;old.&#8221;) The app has no way of knowing how well a particular bottle has fared, and it only takes one <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cork_taint\">corked wine<\/a> to make people distrust a recommendation tool like this.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s similar to the problem Netflix encounters in making its recommendations. Does it have a good idea of what people like to watch? Sure. But there&#8217;s no accounting for taste &#8212; and when someone&#8217;s literal\u00a0tastebuds are involved, it becomes even harder to know what they&#8217;ll like. Wine Ring can&#8217;t be perfect.<\/p>\n<p>Still, it could be good enough. Sometimes people don&#8217;t want to have to guess what they might like to try, and they don&#8217;t want to ask anyone else for help. A recommendations tool like this can make their life easier, more comfortable, and less stressful whenever they have to pick a bottle of wine. If those people are willing to drink a few duds and forgive the app, it&#8217;ll be just fine for them.<\/p>\n<p>As for me? I&#8217;ll try to figure out what I like the old-fashioned way\u00a0&#8212;\u00a0by drinking every bottle I can get my hands on. It&#8217;s time to really put this liver to work.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Walking into even the smallest wine store, or perusing the shortest wine list at a local restaurant, can be daunting.

One of the things that have made a huge difference to the lives of people all around the world is social media. This is something that has helped not only general internet users but also business users, as social media platforms have expanded to make life easier in many different ways from communications through to branding, marketing and more.<\/p>\n<p>A very informative infographic has now been put together by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.voucherbin.co.uk\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">VoucherBin<\/a>, and this provides important details relating to the use of social media and its evolution. Of course, social media is used all around the world by people wanting to communicate with friends and family but as the infographic shows that is far more to these platforms than just communication. They can be used for all sorts of things such as finding out more about entertainment options, new products coming onto the market, getting help with finding a job or even catching up on the latest celebrity gossip.<\/p>\n<p>You can find out more about the different social network platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram and Linkedin. You will also see how the popularity of social media platforms has continued to increase between 2010 and 2015, with all sites experiencing growth in terms of active population. <\/p>\n<p>The inforgraphic also details important information relating to business, such as how marketers use <a href=\"http:\/\/www.voucherbin.co.uk\/social-media-the-largest-international-expo-infographic\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">social media<\/a> for more than six hours each week in order to further their marketing efforts. 20 percent of people have also admitted to making stories up for use on social media so that their posts are more attention-grabbing. A surprising figure that is detailed in this infographic is that each month Google+ receives 48 percent more visits than Facebook with 1.2 billion as opposed to 809 million.<\/p>\n<p>Another thing you can read about is how recruiters are now using social media more and more, and how social media has helped to make product launches and promotions far more successful. You will be able to compare the figures between different platforms when it comes to promoting brands and products and you\u2019ll see how event organisers are making use of these platforms too. <\/p>\n<p>When it comes to the use of social media for general consumers, the infographic shows how shoppers have become increasingly reliant on these platforms as well as how consumers feel about helping to promote brands via social media. When it comes to applying for a job many employers now browse applicants\u2019 social media accounts before making a decision, and this is also detailed in the infographic.<\/p>\n<p>The entertainment world also relies on social media, and you will be able to learn more about how people were posting on these sites following major awards events such as the Oscars and Grammy Awards. You can also find out more about which celebrities are major users of sites such as Twitter and which events have managed to result in the accumulation of millions of posts and tweets. <\/p>\n<p>An interesting twist to the inforgraphic is that it also provides information on the downside of social media as well as the more positive side. This includes figures on company responses to consumers via social networks, what percentage of posts such as tweets are ignored and how many users of certain social networking sites are actually active. <\/p>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Social-Media-The-Largest-International-Expo.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Social-Media-The-Largest-International-Expo\" width=\"658\" height=\"4087\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-920611\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Social-Media-The-Largest-International-Expo.jpg 658w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Social-Media-The-Largest-International-Expo-300x1863.jpg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Social-Media-The-Largest-International-Expo-320x1988.jpg 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Social-Media-The-Largest-International-Expo-640x3975.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px\" \/>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Over recent years, there have been a number of changes that have helped to revolutionise our lives, particularly online.

There are over a\u00a0million sellers on Poshmark uploading the inventory equivalent of a Nordstorm store <i>every week<\/i>.\u00a0With the combined power of Poshmark&#8217;s sellers, the platform is essentially opening just over 50 Nordstrom stores each year, with more than 5,000 brands represented in said inventory.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Not only is the seller community active, though &#8212; Poshmark&#8217;s buyers are also a very active bunch. Poshmark founder and CEO Manish Chandra highlights the importance of the strong, active community to Poshmark&#8217;s success. Much of the company&#8217;s efforts revolve around building user feeds and providing both buyers and sellers with tools that keep users engaged.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;The result is that today, our average user opens the app somewhere between 7\u00a0to 9\u00a0times a day, and spends somewhere between 20\u00a0to 25 minutes a day in the app,&#8221; says Chandra.\u00a0&#8220;So, you have some Instagram\/Facebook-level of engagement in the platform.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Those are some pretty impressive usage stats. Over the last few years as Poshmark has been scaling rapidly, with their users following suit. Though many of the sellers in the Poshmark network likely started selling out of their own closets, some have begun tapping local wholesale markets and, as Chandra says, &#8220;effectively converting their closet into a full-blown fashion boutique.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That said, this is\u00a0why the\u00a0move to expand into retail opportunities makes a lot of sense. Poshmark&#8217;s expansion is going to center around a wholesale portal that&#8217;ll give sellers the opportunity to connect with brands and buy merchandise to sell in their online Poshmark stores through said portal. For many sellers, this means access to new wholesale channels and inventory. Style Mafia and Snob Essentials are among the first round of brands spearheading the retail expansion, but dozens more are set to join the charge.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Snob-Essentials-Wholesale-Closet-Edit.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-920608 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Snob-Essentials-Wholesale-Closet-Edit-153x300.jpg\" alt=\"Snob Essentials Wholesale Closet Edit\" width=\"153\" height=\"300\" data-attribution=\"Poshmark\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Snob-Essentials-Wholesale-Closet-Edit-153x300.jpg 153w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Snob-Essentials-Wholesale-Closet-Edit-411x804.jpg 411w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Snob-Essentials-Wholesale-Closet-Edit-968x1893.jpg 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Snob-Essentials-Wholesale-Closet-Edit-72x140.jpg 72w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Snob-Essentials-Wholesale-Closet-Edit-767x1500.jpg 767w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Snob-Essentials-Wholesale-Closet-Edit-300x587.jpg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Snob-Essentials-Wholesale-Closet-Edit-320x626.jpg 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Snob-Essentials-Wholesale-Closet-Edit-640x1252.jpg 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Snob-Essentials-Wholesale-Closet-Edit-804x1572.jpg 804w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Snob-Essentials-Wholesale-Closet-Edit.jpg 1057w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 153px) 100vw, 153px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;We wanted fashion brands to be able to connect this massive sales force\u00a0of one million sellers that we&#8217;ve created and also for sellers to have access to the best of the best and even to the new fashion brands that are emerging,&#8221; says Chandra. &#8220;So to do that, we&#8217;ve created a wholesale portal, which allows fashion brands to stock up wholesale inventory into that portal and for our sellers to come in and shop\u2026 and really buy wholesale inventory directly from their brands on our platform, and then use that existing commerce and logistics engine to service their platform.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">On the buyer side, the Poshmark experience will give buyers the flexibility to choose between resale and retail items, or to browse both. Chandra compares Poshmark&#8217;s vast catalog and new shopping options to Uber, where users have some flexibility in tailoring their experience, whether it&#8217;s UberX or Black Car service. &#8220;It gives a flexibility that shoppers have really never had on any platform out there to choose how and what they shop.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Though Poshmark is expanding its services into an entirely new arena with retail opportunities, much of Poshmark&#8217;s main focus is unchanged. Because Poshmark&#8217;s strength doesn&#8217;t necessary lie with specific brands or a single outstanding feature, it lies within the community. This expansion isn&#8217;t an attempt to overhaul user experience, but to give the buying, selling and brand communities new ways to access one another.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Poshmark-Wholesale-Portal-Edit.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-920610 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Poshmark-Wholesale-Portal-Edit-153x300.jpg\" alt=\"Poshmark Wholesale Portal Edit\" width=\"153\" height=\"300\" data-attribution=\"Poshmark\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Poshmark-Wholesale-Portal-Edit-153x300.jpg 153w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Poshmark-Wholesale-Portal-Edit-411x804.jpg 411w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Poshmark-Wholesale-Portal-Edit-968x1893.jpg 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Poshmark-Wholesale-Portal-Edit-72x140.jpg 72w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Poshmark-Wholesale-Portal-Edit-767x1500.jpg 767w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Poshmark-Wholesale-Portal-Edit-300x587.jpg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Poshmark-Wholesale-Portal-Edit-320x626.jpg 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Poshmark-Wholesale-Portal-Edit-640x1252.jpg 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Poshmark-Wholesale-Portal-Edit-804x1572.jpg 804w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/Poshmark-Wholesale-Portal-Edit.jpg 1057w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 153px) 100vw, 153px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;In one shot, [brands] can move inventory into a group of sellers that they never had access to. For sellers, they can come to one area, choose the brands they like, and stock up their stores in ones shot. And for our shoppers, they start to get access to an increasingly large selection of merchandise, which gives them the power to shop resale and retail. And we&#8217;re launching the wholesale portal partnership with over a dozen different fashion brands, with many many more in the pipeline.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In addition to the retail wholesale portal expansion, Poshmark is also announcing \u00a0a new\u00a0<\/span>\u201cPoshmark Fashion Entrepreneurs Fund\u201d, which will award $500 grants (not loans, grants) to 50 Poshmark sellers to help them begin scaling their business.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;That, I think, is very much who we are,&#8221; says Chandra. &#8220;Our growth is synergistic with the growth of our community, and everything we do is really to support our community to grow, which ultimately drives the growth of Poshmark.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Poshmark announced today that it will start adding well-known retail brands to its active community of women&#8217;s fashion-focused buyers and sellers.

(It&#8217;s basically\u00a0the &#8220;discover&#8221; tool Twitter should&#8217;ve built.) Today&#8217;s announcement also comes shortly after the debut of Twitter&#8217;s Moments feature, which is the social networks answer to news aggregation &#8212; something many think Nuzzel has done much better.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our newsletter platform is a natural extension of technology we have already built in our app and website, but [&#8230;] we are expanding beyond a personal consumption experience to also being a platform where people can share stuff,&#8221; Nuzzel chief executive Jonathan Abrams\u00a0says. &#8220;This is good for spreading the word about Nuzzel, but it&#8217;s also pretty logical for a service that is completely based on social-based news discovery to have more social features.&#8221;<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/newsletter_dashboard.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-920601\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/newsletter_dashboard-804x633.png\" alt=\"newsletter_dashboard\" width=\"804\" height=\"633\" data-attribution=\"Nuzzel\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/newsletter_dashboard-804x633.png 804w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/newsletter_dashboard-300x236.png 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/newsletter_dashboard-968x763.png 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/newsletter_dashboard-178x140.png 178w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/newsletter_dashboard-1500x1182.png 1500w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/newsletter_dashboard-320x252.png 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2015\/10\/newsletter_dashboard-640x504.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 804px) 100vw, 804px\" \/><\/a>\n<p>Newsletters have enjoyed quite the rise over the last few years. Publications use them to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.niemanlab.org\/2015\/09\/what-you-need-to-know-how-six-publishers-digest-the-news-for-their-readers\/\">present the news<\/a> to readers in easy-to-digest formats, writers <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.newscred.com\/how-journalist-ann-friedman-built-a-newsletter-empire\/\">send them to<\/a> promote their work and stay in touch with their audience, and services like MailChimp&#8217;s\u00a0TinyLetter exist to make <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/3021751\/innovation-agents\/how-tinyletter-is-making-us-fall-in-love-with-email-again\">sending a newsletter<\/a> pretty simple. So, where is Nuzzel&#8217;s new platform supposed to fit into this trending category?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;[W]e believe that +90 percent of influencers don&#8217;t have their own newsletter, because getting up at 5 a.m. and editi<span class=\"aBn\"><span class=\"aQJ\">ng i<\/span><\/span>t manually every morning is way too much work,&#8221; Abrams says. &#8220;So, by offering an automated approach to generating a relevant newsletter, we think this enables a whole group of influencers to have a newsletter who might not have had one otherwise&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The struggle will be in finding the balance between automating the process to make it easier for people to share articles that (supposedly) interest them, as well as\u00a0giving users enough control over the email to make them feel personal. Nuzzel is trying to find the right balance by using its curation tools, while also giving its users the ability to write\u00a0short introductions for\u00a0their morning newsletters.<\/p>\n<p>This will make things easy for people who are interesting in jumping aboard the newsletter bandwagon, but hesitate to do so without a little assistance. (A technological springboard, perhaps.) It could\u00a0also get Nuzzel in front of people who would never use its service otherwise. And given that the company is a venture-backed startup that <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/09\/30\/social-news-curation-app-nuzzel-finds-backers-in-the-media-world\/\">just raised more funding<\/a>, that&#8217;s not a bad thing.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our apps are great, but there are probably hundreds of millions of people who would subscribe to an email newsletter but not install an app or have a Twitter account,&#8221; Abrams says. He adds that getting a newsletter ostensibly curated by a friend is more personal than getting &#8220;a news digest from a newspaper or from Yahoo or Google,&#8221; at least from Nuzzel&#8217;s admittedly-biased perspective.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a win for Nuzzel either way. It doesn&#8217;t matter if someone likes the newsletters if they decide they like a curated reading experience and sign up for the main service, nor does it matter if they like the main service so long as they like receiving the newsletters. And if they like both? Well, that just makes them the kind of engaged user that social startups just love to hold on to.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Nuzzel is expanding its social reading service with a newsletter platform that automatically collects five of the most popular articles in a&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611561,"featured_media":920605,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[22956385,359216622,359231620],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920600"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611561"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920600"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920600\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920605"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920600"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920600"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920600"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":941039,"date":"2015-10-28T07:31:46","date_gmt":"2015-10-28T14:31:46","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/?p=248352"},"modified":"2015-10-28T07:31:46","modified_gmt":"2015-10-28T14:31:46","slug":"connected-cars-objects-in-the-future-are-closer-than-they-appear","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/10\/28\/connected-cars-objects-in-the-future-are-closer-than-they-appear\/","title":{"rendered":"Connected cars: Objects in the future are closer than they appear"},"content":{"rendered":"<div style=\"background: #eeeeee\">Today, because some connected products are more clever than critical (see\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mediapost.com\/publications\/article\/259770\/bud-light-launches-smart-fridge-to-track-beer-supp.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"Hyperlink0\">Budweiser\u2019s smart refrigerator<\/span><\/a>) while others generate more buzz than users (see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.emarketer.com\/Article\/Putting-Smart-Watch-Adoption-Perspective\/1012595\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"Hyperlink0\">smartwatches<\/span><\/a>), it can be easy to believe our universally connected future is still some distance away. But one device is coming around the bend <a href=\"http:\/\/lt.dell.com\/lt\/lt.aspx?CID=286157&amp;LID=5477257&amp;DGC=SM&amp;DGSeg=GEN&amp;RED=301&amp;DURL=https:\/\/powermore.dell.com\/technology\/ces-2015-connected-cars-steal-the-show\/\" target=\"_blank\">more quickly than the rest: the connected car<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>There is a spectrum of connectivity for cars. On one end, there are the \u2018reasonably\u2019 smart cars that connect to a phone or other device to, for example, play music. On the other end is the car that is so smart that it drives itself. While companies like Google and Tesla are innovating on the latter, our very near future lands more in the middle of the spectrum, with humans behind the wheel of a vehicle that is equipped to collect and share data with drivers, other cars and even the broader infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>A number of factors are fueling interest here. For one, like our smartphone appendages, smart cars offer convenience. The ability to, for example, program your air conditioner to turn on when your vehicle is <em>x<\/em> miles from home, has a certain amount of appeal. Even more welcome are software updates, such as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.com\/2015\/10\/tesla-self-driving-over-air-update-live\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"Hyperlink1\">Tesla\u2019s recent \u201cautopilot\u201d update<\/span><\/a>, that can instantly improve the functionality and value of a vehicle long after purchase. But an even more celebrated benefit is safety; whether through intelligent monitoring of car operations or vehicle-to-vehicle data transfer, the connected car is more consistently and effectively alert than even the most conscientious driver. And, last but not least, the collection and analysis of smart car data also presents a significant opportunity for improvement to our infrastructure, allowing for better traffic control, as well as environmental benefits like reduced emissions.<\/p>\n<p>The infrastructure upsides, in particular, have not gone unnoticed. Last month, as reported by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.popsci.com\/connected-cars-to-roll-out-across-us\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"Hyperlink0\">Popular Science<\/span><\/a>, U.S. transportation secretary Anthony Foxx announced that $42 million dollars will be invested rolling out thousands of connected cars in the US. This initiative, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.its.dot.gov\/pilots\/cv_pilot_plan.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"Hyperlink0\">the U.S.\u2019s largest vehicle-to-vehicle pilot program<\/span><\/a>, promotes collaboration among the stakeholders\u2014which range from private companies to states to transit agencies\u2014and opens the door to research on what will prove to be a wealth of data gained from the smart cars. The investment represents a meaningful leap forward in our connected car future.<\/p>\n<p>But how ready are consumers? According to a new <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kcentv.com\/story\/30250326\/att-drive-studio-and-ericsson-release-global-study-on-connected-car-buyers\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"Hyperlink0\">AT&amp;T Drive Studio and Ericsson study<\/span><\/a>, eighty percent of car buyers globally would opt to delay the purchase of a new car by a year in order to get connected features. Three-quarters of those surveyed considered connectivity features important to their next car, with the ability for the car to serve as a Wi-Fi hotspot ranking most in demand. In other words, we\u2019re ready for our cars to be as smart as our phones, independent of our phones.<\/p>\n<p>This doesn\u2019t come without concern. For all the benefits of connected cars, there are <a href=\"http:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/2015\/10\/the-central-paradox-of-the-internet-of-things-connected-means-less-secure\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"Hyperlink0\">well-documented<\/span><\/a> hacks and cheats that paint a picture of connected cars that is closer to Stephen King\u2019s <em>Christine<\/em> than Knight Industries Two Thousand (KITT). We\u2019re already being exposed to the dark side of our bright and shiny connected future. Is that enough to slow things down?<\/p>\n<p>Not likely. As the public\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.copenhagenize.com\/2011\/02\/anti-automobile-age-and-what-we-can.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"Hyperlink2\">initial resistance to \u201cMotordom<\/span><\/a>\u201d in the early 20th century serves to remind us, danger alone is not an impediment to progress. Just as traffic lights, speed limits and stops signs were conjured to mitigate the dangers of the motor age, so the rise of connected cars will prompt a new set of measures to minimize risk. That risk can\u2019t be fully eliminated, but we\u2019ll learn to adapt because the benefits of connected cars\u2014from day-to-day conveniences to less traffic, reduced fuel consumption, and fewer accidents\u2014are simply too great to resist.<\/p>\n<p><i>This post was written as part of the Dell Insight Partners program, which provides news and analysis about the evolving world of tech.

Recently, it\u2019s seen a rise in \u2018best of breed\u2019 apps, which in turn, has contributed to the fall of the enterprise monopoly. More specifically,\u00a0there are\u00a0three factors fueling this change, including the reality of the problem, the collective app economy, and new technology enabling the next generation of business applications.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"the-reality-of-the-enterprise-\">The reality of the enterprise problem<\/h3>\n<p>Over\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/article\/enterprise-software-spend-to-reach-620-billion-in-2015-forrester\/\">$600 billion<\/a>\u00a0is spent on enterprise software each year. And to date, modern enterprises have had two options: buy big, unfocused packages that excel in nothing; or buy small, focused \u2019best of breed\u2019 apps and risk an integration nightmare.<\/p>\n<p>First off, the major software platforms purchased by IT departments provide tools to make thousands of different features for thousands of different types of users. These products are cumbersome when they are overloaded, often perceived as hostile by the user, and difficult to learn. What\u2019s more, this obstacle isn\u2019t bypassed when they move to the cloud in an attempt to keep up with changing trends. But since these products seem to solve everything, they\u2019ve been successful for quite some time and become the status quo in the software market.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, the \u2019best of breed\u2019 apps have been the preferred choice by business executives, and they have increasingly received support among all employees. With the consumerization of enterprise technology, products now enter a company from the bottom up, rather than the top down.<\/p>\n<p>In the private space, you can easily compose your own suite of software tools to accomplish a task. To throw a birthday party, for example, go to the app store and get a calendar app, a social app, an invitation app and you&#8217;re set.<\/p>\n<p>Those who have grown up today with the ease of an app store are entering into the positions at enterprises. They want their daily business tools such as accounting and smart marketing tools to be as accessible as messaging apps and car navigators. Enterprises must endorse this through the fast and easy delivery of efficient tools to employees who need a certain software to accomplish a special task.<\/p>\n<p>Although these have been the two prevalent options among enterprises, the reality is that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/blog\/projectfailures\/study-68-percent-of-it-projects-fail\/1175\">68 percent<\/a> of IT projects fail. These failures are forcing CIOs and CEOs at enterprises to seek change from the status quo.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"the-collective-app-economy\">The collective app economy<\/h3>\n<p>When multiple small apps band together, they can upend the status quo \u2013 this is the new collective app economy. Today, new technology is allowing this to happen:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allowing enterprises to mix and match best of breed apps without the need for complex and expensive integration projects.<\/li>\n<li>Allowing each vendor to be on top of its own food chain.<\/li>\n<li>Allowing new business models to outperform the existing ones in the enterprise software business.<\/li>\n<li>Allowing app stores, for example, to deliver interoperating apps and to be truly polylithic.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The \u2019best of breed\u2019 app vendors often have an innovative edge because of their focus and domain knowledge. Though they still cannot check off as many boxes as the big vendors with their ecosystem of piggy-backers, and buyers shun complex, expensive, lengthy and risky integration projects.<\/p>\n<p>The incumbent software platforms will not be replaced by a single app, no matter how elegant, intuitive, and powerful the app is. That\u2019s because a single app can never replace the full functionality of the large players\u2019 platforms. The best of breed apps must be able to be mixed-and-matched without the need for complex integration projects.<\/p>\n<p>A single mobile payment app, for example, cannot replace a full retail solution. However, combining best of breed apps for accounting, product stock and point of sales results in a virtual retail suite that can outperform the larger players. These new apps are promising and must meet two critical conditions to gain any significant market share:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>It must be possible to run multiple independent business apps by different vendors side by side in a modern web user interface. Together they create your virtual business solution.<\/li>\n<li>The apps must operate on the same set of data without knowing about each other. All apps being aware of all other apps simply does not scale. APIs have been the peer-to-peer glue between apps for 50 years, and independent business apps still do not operate on a single set of data.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>As new technology is now solving the vital, if not all, components of the \u201dshared data and shared screen\u201d problems, this will have a major impact for enterprise software vendors and enterprises.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"the-next-generation-of-busines\">The next generation of business applications<\/h3>\n<p>Technology comes before revolution. Always. Though not typically obvious when first introduced, the importance of truly novel technology is not something reserved for tech geeks; in fact, it is and has always been vital for the evolution of the human race. Modems and computers were not invented to power the web. Rather, the web was discovered because we had computers and modems.<\/p>\n<p>The new generation of in-memory application platforms will not only transform the database industry; it will forever change the enterprise software industry. How? By combining an in-memory database engine, data processing and application server into a single business operating system. This technology can deliver the capabilities of a huge data center in that single server. It can allow many small independent applications in combination to replace a monolithic application. It can remove the need for a single application to be the master of all others. Plus, the speed, radical efficiently, low costs and openness will help drive fast and wide adoption.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"time-to-band-together\">Time to band together<\/h3>\n<p>The enterprise software landscape will change dramatically in the near future. The new software landscape will be simultaneously fragmented and connected, with new business models created by collaboration among many small vendors.<\/p>\n<p>It is time for vendors and talents to band together in order to provide businesses with the freedom to use the best tools needed to meet their goals, instead of being locked into a single vendor that is a jack of all trades, but master of none.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Kristoffer is chief executive at\u00a0Starcounter.

After rereading it, I realized that I had left the release up in my browser because it could be the poster child for the inane manner in which technology vendors and IT consulting firms are talking about and selling what they very much want to be the next big thing \u2013 Digital Transformation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CA Technologies\u2019 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/ca-technologies-study-reveals-widespread-adoption-of-digital-transformation-2015-10-06\">press release<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0was a horrific example right from the start. It\u2019s title, \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CA Technologies Study Reveals Widespread Adoption of Digital Transformation\u201d, nearly made me spit coffee all over my laptop. Really? Is Digital Transformation (DT) something that can be adopted? Hardly. After all, DT is not a discrete technology. Rather, it\u2019s a never-ending journey that organizations undertake to better the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DT involves making changes to business objectives, strategies, models, cultures, processes and so many other elements. Many of those changes can be supported by the deployment and adoption of enabling technologies, but DT isn\u2019t about the technology itself. It\u2019s a mindset, a way of thinking and acting as an organization that spans across all of its planning and execution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In that regard, DT is very much like the discipline known as Knowledge Management (KM) that was similarly a darling of technology vendors and their consulting partners nearly 20 years ago. Most large enterprises at least considered implementing KM practices and technologies. In fact, many did, although the majority of those \u2018efforts\u2019 failed to survive an initial pilot program. In the end, only a few big companies, the ones that treated KM as something more than a technology set to be adopted, whole-heartedly embraced the discipline and successfully wove it into nearly every aspect of their businesses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We\u2019ve seen the same phenomenon play out with Social Business. McKinsey &amp; Company has been tracking the deployment and impact of social constructs, behaviors and tools in a cohort of roughly 1,500 enterprises for nearly 10 years now. Earlier this month, in a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mckinsey.com\/insights\/business_technology\/taking_the_measure_of_the_networked_enterprise\" target=\"_blank\">teaser<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0to its complete report of annual survey results, McKinsey published these related and telling findings:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-%e2%80%9c-35-percent22\" ><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201c&#8230;35 percent of the companies had adopted social technologies in response to their adoption by competitors. Copycat behavior was also responsible for their diffusion within organizations, though at a slightly lower rate: 25 percent of all employee usage. Roughly a fifth of the companies we studied will account for an estimated 50 percent of all social-technology usage in 2015.\u201d<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Most organizations and individuals tried to \u2018adopt\u2019 social technologies because they felt competitive pressure to do so (thanks, in part, to vendors and consultants), not because they had investigated and understood how \u2018being social\u2019 at work could change how well their organization actually performed relative to both its current state and its competitors. On the other hand, a minority of organizations (20% in McKinsey\u2019s survey) have made the dedicated, all-in commitment needed to succeed with Social Business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Today, we are beginning this cycle all over again, this time under the moniker of Digital Transformation. Consider these findings from CA\u2019s study:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-%e2%80%9cdigital-tra23\" ><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cDigital Transformation is being driven as a coordinated strategy across a majority of organizations (55 percent)&#8230; \u00a0As a result, 45 percent of respondents have already seen measurable increases in customer retention and acquisition from their digital transformation initiatives and 44 percent have seen an overall increase in revenue.\u201d<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In other words, if you aren\u2019t &#8220;adopting&#8221;\u00a0DT already, you\u2019re toast. At least that\u2019s what CA and other technology vendors and consultants want you to believe in a fresh state of panic. Hence these findings from CA\u2019s study:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-%e2%80%9cdigital-dis24\" ><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Digital Disrupters have two times higher revenue growth than mainstream organizations. They report two and a half times higher profit growth than the mainstream organizations.\u201d<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That may be accurate, but surely those \u201cDigital Disrupters\u201d did not achieve the reported results merely by adopting technology, whether it be from CA or another vendor. They\u2019re the ones who have taken a comprehensive view of DT and, as CA itself puts it, have \u201c&#8230;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">many projects underway in multiple areas of the company, including customer services, sales and marketing, and product\/service development.\u201d It\u2019s not a coincidence that CA was only able to include 14% of the organizations surveyed in the group it labeled \u201cDigital Disrupters\u201d. That matches up pretty well with McKinsey\u2019s finding of just 20% of organizations surveyed making more than a token effort at becoming a social business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">All of this is to say beware of vendors and consultants selling technology as the cornerstone of DT initiatives. Yes, technology is an invaluable piece of the puzzle, but it\u2019s not the only or most important one. DT can\u2019t simply be adopted; every aspect of it must be considered and actively embraced by the entire organization.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I was sorting through some browser tabs that had been open for a couple of weeks on my laptop and rediscovered a&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87625438,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[19290,359215977,359216056,89438,141193,1098,359217219,258714,47945,15328,359235171,359216373,359235225,4236,10954,8846,359235226,28285,6335,9719,3457,8553,359215905,86178,136324],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/941040"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87625438"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=941040"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/941040\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=941040"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=941040"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=941040"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":941041,"date":"2015-10-26T17:12:25","date_gmt":"2015-10-27T00:12:25","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/?p=248337"},"modified":"2015-10-26T17:12:25","modified_gmt":"2015-10-27T00:12:25","slug":"one-ring-to-rule-them-all","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/10\/26\/one-ring-to-rule-them-all\/","title":{"rendered":"One ring to rule them all?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>In the last couple of weeks there have been several announcements about phones and phone numbers.

At the same time Google has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-09-30\/google-plans-to-standardize-messaging-with-jibe-acquisition\">purchased an RCS<\/a> (Rich Communications Services) business, allowing them perhaps to add more intelligent routing capability to their Google Voice services. \u00a0All of this points, rather improbably at some level, to a long life for the phone number. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Carriers and IoT<\/strong><br \/>\nThe announcements by <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.att.net\/consumerblog\/story\/a7799556\">ATT<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/t-mobile-and-sprint-to-allow-one-phone-number-for-multiple-devices\/\">Sprint, and T Mobile<\/a> are about a single number ringing multiple devices. It appears that this is most focused on IoT scenarios- as more and more devices are connected to \u201cthe network\u201d then clearly it makes sense to be able to address them.\u00a0 <\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s worth questioning whether the currently wireless service providers are the right service providers for IoT solutions. Managing a single customer relationship and a single device is very different from a family and 25-50 distinct \u201cthings\u201d to be communicated with, and the fact we still have a robust ecosystem of Mobile Device Management players (e.g. AirWatch, Good) suggest that there is a lot of enterprise telephony still to be captured by carriers (or not) never mind every robot in a factory.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mom- what\u2019s MPOP?<\/strong><br \/>\nWhy is this fairly simple idea new, and how hard is it to execute? Multiple Points of Presence (MPOP, the ability to send a call addressed to one device\/person to more than one end point) in communications systems usually implies a server or similar capability in the cloud. That has to be the first delivery point of the message\/call, which then in turn routes the incoming message to one or more devices.\u00a0That secondary delivery is being managed by someone who is not always as expert at message delivery, or who is trying to do something more complicated (and edge-case prone) than simply make sure a call ends up in one and exactly one place. <\/p>\n<p>Anyone who has ever logged onto a communications service on a device they haven\u2019t used for a while to see a old unseen message pop in as new is experiencing the downside of poorly implemented versions of this approach.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Software and smarter numbers?<\/strong><br \/>\nBurner is taking the opposite approach. They are offering multiple temporary numbers which map to a single physical device. The value proposition of burnable numbers is fairly clear, and removes some of the queasy feeling you get as you look at a form where the only possible next step is a call from a pushy sales person, or\u00a0robocalls about your credit card balance.<\/p>\n<p>Burner\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@gregcohn\/why-we-think-burner-connections-is-a-non-obvious-no-brainer-54627f9ca186#.f92m22ny4\">most recent announcements<\/a> are an extension of their idea of single burnable numbers. By imagining the phone number as a platform, they are looking to integrate apps like Dropbox and Evernote with a managed phone number, allowing automated customer service and similar capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s acquisition of Jibe Mobile, an RCS based messaging company, also speaks to the resilience of the carrier centric approach here, and to the value of bringing software thinking to the routing and handling of messages. RCS is usually seen as the \u201ccarriers\u2019 response to OTT and other rich messaging,\u201d and is touted as a potential replacement for SMS. It does allow some freedom from phone numbers, but is ultimately more about making complex communications capabilities usable (like escalating seamlessly from instant message to calls, or transferring a session from device to device).<\/p>\n<p><strong>I\u2019m not dead yet!<\/strong><br \/>\nSo whether it\u2019s many devices having the same number, or one device having multiple numbers, in the short term it seems like we have some life left in phone numbers (despite many attempts to declare them already dead). In the medium and longer term it is going to be interesting to see who wins in this space, and whether the capabilities developed for a numbered world will transfer to a broader set of solutions, or be be siloed. Just as IPv4 failed to scale to the number of devices connected to the internet, it\u2019s hard to see how phone numbers do that for IoT. Phone numbers will not have a clear and glorious death \u2013 perhaps like the fax and telex, they will be with us until we wake up one day and realize they have gone.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the last couple of weeks there have been several announcements about phones and phone numbers.

A friend&#8217;s birthday is on their profile page, the address for a concert is on its event page; and the time a television show airs is found on yet another page. Now that will all be funneled into a single place with today&#8217;s update.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook will offer other information, too, in this updated notifications tab. Want to know about the weather? How about when a movie is playing? Or a list of recommendations for dinner spots? Sure, you can find all those things with other services, but now you can also see everything right from Facebook&#8217;s app.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a bit like Google Now but for Facebook. Google wanted to become the one place where people turn to find information; now Facebook wants to do the same. There are differences &#8212; Google Now pulls\u00a0information\u00a0from other apps, whereas Facebook seems to be limited to its own data &#8212; but the idea&#8217;s the same.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook also has the benefit of sticking this in a place where everyone will see it. The company has occasion to make people&#8217;s phones buzz in their pockets many times throughout the day, thanks to the sheer amount of comments, likes, shares, and other forms of interaction available on everything that&#8217;s shared to it.<\/p>\n<p>Now, every time one of those notifications is sent, people have a chance to fall down the rabbit hole. Only instead of finding the Wonderland into which Alice fell, they&#8217;ll enter a world where people share their opinions, their photographs, and the funniest memes in exchange for the only currency that matters, &#8220;Likes.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a good plan to make people more dependent on Facebook, to spend more time in its mobile app, and even to provide yet another place where the company can put\u00a0advertisements between the things people really want to see. The update is rolling out to Android and iPhone users in the United States now.<\/p>\n<p>For a closer look, check out the demo video below from Facebook.<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/143581652\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\"frameborder=\"0\" title=\"A More Useful Notifications Tab on Mobile\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook is rolling out an updated notifications tab today that puts local news, upcoming events, and other miscellaneous information next to the&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611561,"featured_media":908548,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359218214,57332],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920590"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611561"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920590"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920590\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/908548"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920590"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920590"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920590"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920589,"date":"2015-10-26T11:01:51","date_gmt":"2015-10-26T18:01:51","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920589"},"modified":"2015-10-26T11:25:04","modified_gmt":"2015-10-26T18:25:04","slug":"airbnb-tests-journeys-a-fully-managed-travel-service","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/10\/26\/airbnb-tests-journeys-a-fully-managed-travel-service\/","title":{"rendered":"Airbnb tests Journeys, a fully-managed travel service"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Airbnb is <a href=\"http:\/\/thenextweb.com\/insider\/2015\/10\/26\/airbnb-tests-booking-your-entire-trip-with-new-journeys-service\/\">testing a new service<\/a> that will give people something to do in new cities and, in the process, forever dispel the notion that its platform is <em>just<\/em> about helping people find a couch to crash on in a kindly stranger&#8217;s apartment.\u00a0It&#8217;s called Journeys, and it&#8217;s currently available as invite-only to people who want to visit San Francisco in December, but haven&#8217;t yet booked their trips.<\/p>\n<p>Journeys offers full three-to-five-day travel plans to its selected\u00a0testers. Through it, Airbnb will offer a free meal during each day; planned excursions devoted to San Francisco&#8217;s nightlife, natural wonders, or food scene; agent-selected rooms; and a Lyft ride from the airport to wherever the person is staying. These trips will reportedly cost between $500 and $750 for the individuals invited to use it.<\/p>\n<p>Journeys is focused more on providing a good trip &#8212; think of it less as a personal assistant and more as a travel agent. The Next Web, which first revealed\u00a0Journeys, compares it to the <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.airbnb.com\/better-than-a-bellboy-airbnb-concierge-at-you\/\">discontinued concierge service<\/a> Airbnb introduced in 2011. That service was supposed to give travelers everything they could ever want, from offering advice on restaurants to locating the nearest emergency room.<\/p>\n<p>The service also follows other Airbnb tests, including <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2014\/06\/05\/us-airbnb-dinner-idUSKBN0EG29320140605\">a service that<\/a> gathered strangers together for meals in San Francisco, and another that made <a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2014\/07\/21\/airbnb-handybook\/\">cleaning services available<\/a> to hosts in San Francisco, New York, and Los Angeles. Neither of those services has become available to people outside the invite-only tests; Journeys could\u00a0be destined for a similarly long time spent in the testing phase.<\/p>\n<p>Consumers will decide if Journeys is worth the cost. People visiting a city on business, or staying in a neighborhood with which they are familiar, are unlikely to find much value in the service as it currently exists. But those heading to a diverse place like San Francisco on a lark might appreciate having someone to plan their trip for them instead of having to worry about everything themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Journeys could have a larger impact, though, and that will be on the perception of Airbnb as a member of what tech executives dubbed\u00a0the sharing economy.<\/p>\n<p>The term &#8220;sharing economy&#8221; has <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fastcoexist.com\/3040863\/stop-saying-uber-is-part-of-the-sharing-economy\">always been a misnomer<\/a>. Sharing implies that people are offering something without expecting anything in return. But the economy aspect of that all-too-common buzzphrase requires money to change hands, turning the entire concept into a paradox that allows companies to use it in their marketing even as they got lots of money for their &#8220;sharing&#8221; platforms.<\/p>\n<p>Airbnb was founded to give people a cheap place to stay. Now it&#8217;s operating much like a hotel company\u00a0&#8212; and, with Journeys, a full-fledged travel service\u00a0&#8212; that doesn&#8217;t happen to own the rooms its customers are renting. This reduces overhead, allows the company to avoid training a full staff for each rental, and otherwise gives it a nimbleness that traditional lodging companies are lacking.<\/p>\n<p>This convenience often comes at the expense of luxury. Billing a platform as the place to rent someone&#8217;s apartment in Brooklyn is great for spendthrifts, but the real money is in getting people to see Airbnb properties as a valid alternative to expensive hotels instead of to the Holiday Inns or grimy hostels of the world. Journeys is one step towards that goal, and one away from the sharing economy.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are always experimenting with new ways to create meaningful experiences on Airbnb,&#8221; a company spokesperson said when I asked for comment on this story. &#8221; We don\u2019t have anything specific to share at this time.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Airbnb is testing a new service that will give people something to do in new cities and, in the process, forever dispel&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611561,"featured_media":920592,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359227057,359234082,5358979],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920589"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611561"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920589"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920589\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920592"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920589"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920589"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920589"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920585,"date":"2015-10-26T10:55:09","date_gmt":"2015-10-26T17:55:09","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920585"},"modified":"2015-10-27T09:43:48","modified_gmt":"2015-10-27T16:43:48","slug":"your-trainer-app-wants-to-help-you-work-out-smarter-not-harder","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/10\/26\/your-trainer-app-wants-to-help-you-work-out-smarter-not-harder\/","title":{"rendered":"&#8216;YourTrainer&#8217; app wants to help you work out smarter, not harder"},"content":{"rendered":"<p class=\"p1\">Working out is hard. And most of the time, it sucks.\u00a0Like all things that suck, though, tech is trying to making working out better. It&#8217;ll likely be awhile before our devices can work out <i>for <\/i>us, but in the meantime, there are a few companies trying to help folks work out on their own terms. Enter\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/yourtrainer.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Your Trainer<\/a>:\u00a0the startup behind the app of the same name that employs user feedback to generate a personalized exercising regimen.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We all work long hours, put in overtime, drink too much coffee, get too little sleep, and have Netflix queues that overfloweth. We buy gym memberships, go regularly for three weeks, make excuses and then cancel over the phone in shame two months later. It&#8217;s fine, it happens to the best of us.\u00a0Maybe it&#8217;s because actually going to the gym is a big enough pain in the ass that we&#8217;re willing to bail. Maybe it&#8217;s because we don&#8217;t have anyone keeping us honest. Maybe it&#8217;s just because we have no real idea how to work out effectively. Normally, this is where a personal trainer comes in.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Personal trainers are great. Really. If they&#8217;re qualified and mostly decent human being-wise and care about helping you reach your goals, they can be a huge asset in the fitness game. But they&#8217;re also\u00a0<i>really\u00a0<\/i>expensive. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.webmd.com\/fitness-exercise\/finding-personal-fitness-trainer?page=2\" target=\"_blank\">According to the National Strength and Conditioning Association<\/a>, personal trainers run an average rate of about $50\/hour. For those of us ballin&#8217; on a budget, that lands us pretty much right back where we started: on the couch.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Don&#8217;t get too comfortable just yet though &#8212; there might be a better way to work out.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">At first glance, Your Trainer might seem remarkably similar to DailyBurn or any of the other dozens video fitness apps available. But where Your Trainer differs from the DailyBurns of the world is the ability to tailor workouts to you body, goals, and preferences and to\u00a0adjust those\u00a0workouts in realtime. You get a series of short training videos that changes based on your feedback and needs.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;What we set out to do was leverage technology, exercise science, and behavioral psychology to provide all of the benefits of a personal trainer,&#8221; says Your Trainer CEO and founder Larry Cotter.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">It works like this: Your Trainer features over 3,000 short 3-minute videos with a variety of personal trainers. These videos are strung together to create workout streams that are personalized, based on the information you give the app about yourself (height, weight, age, goals, injuries, obstacles) and your preferences (I hate burpees but love Russian Twists*).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Cotter calls these videos &#8220;the periodic table of exercise elements.&#8221; From this massive library of fitness videos, YourTrainer&#8217;s learning algorithm (which we&#8217;ll get to in a moment) draws up a workout stream that&#8217;s built for you.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Which brings us to why, exactly, this app is called Your Trainer. Like a personal trainer, the app has information about you and uses it to find effective exercise elements to put you to work. Your Trainer also provides you with the closest digital equivalent of turning to your personal trainer and saying, &#8220;If you ever make me do that again, I swear I will never work out again.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;We provide you with these interactive controls,&#8221; says Cotter. &#8220;Say something hurts your ankle &#8212; well, you can &#8216;dislike&#8217; it and say it hurts. Then we know to skip that immediately and learn from that, so the next time through, you&#8217;re not going to get that exercise, or other things that are hurting your ankle.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Your Trainer comes in three pricing tiers: Weekly ($6.99 per week), Monthly ($9.99 per month) and Yearly ($99.99 per year) for unlimited workouts.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The goal? Cotter says that Your Trainer is looking to demystify process of getting fit. &#8220;What we want to do is remove the guesswork out of the exercise routine.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>*Obviously not true&#8211;no one loves Russian Twists.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Working out is hard.

Initially the company used ThingWorx\u2019s IoT solution to tackle typical industrial problems like preventative maintenance that are important in reducing downtime as well as some other innovations like altering the revenue model by moving from paying per product to paying per tonnage of earth mined.<\/p>\n<p>The company also added hundreds of sensors to mining equipment so that the underground equipment could be managed from above ground. We see this as a continual theme in the mineral resources industry where there\u2019s a premium on remote control of hard to reach assets as well as a shortage of qualified service technicians whose time must be optimized. Operators only have to be deployed when there\u2019s an actual equipment failure that must be addressed.<\/p>\n<p>All of this is interesting from an IoT perspective but what was truly creative was what JoyGlobal did next. They allowed customers of their mining equipment to opt into providing all of their sensor data to JoyGlobal. This data provides a picture of how efficient a given mining company\u2019s operation is at extracting minerals.<\/p>\n<p>In exchange JoyGlobal benchmarked that data against an anonymized set of data from across the industry to let its customers know how they were stacking up against competitors using the same mining equipment. Customers could compare the exact yield they were getting from a piece of mining equipment versus other companies using the same equipment.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve <a href=\"http:\/\/research.gigaom.com\/2014\/10\/data-analytics-benchmarking-and-agriculture\/\">written previously<\/a> about benchmarking as a business model in IoT. Agtech startup Farmlink, which raised a healthy $40 million last summer, has built its business around benchmarking agricultural fields to a granularity of 150 square feet. Farmers are able to see not just how their farms compare to neighboring farms but can also assess productivity across their own farm.<\/p>\n<p>Benchmarking isn\u2019t a direct boost to operational efficiency but it\u2019s an example of how analytics and intelligence inform managers precisely how efficiently their machinery is working. And it invariably leads to important competitive questions like, if the farm down the road or the mining machinery across the globe are performing at a certain yield, why isn\u2019t my operation performing at that level? This line of inquiry tends to push managers to pinpoint areas where operations can be improved.<\/p>\n<p>For JoyGlobal, adding benchmarking as a service to their existing line of mining machinery services has opened up a potential new line of revenue and perhaps even a new business service. Interestingly, JoyGlobal is similar to Farmlink in that both had other revenue streams related to either selling or renting hardware. Farmlink rents combines, which do large scale harvesting. But by adding connectivity to those combines to collect data regarding yield, Farmlink built an entirely different revenue model. In both of these situations, the existing machinery was in the hands of customers. It was exploring the value of that data and adding benchmarking that created new value.<\/p>\n<p>All of this begs the question: What other industries where there is already significant machinery deployed across a sector could benefit from benchmarking services? For now, I\u2019d bet we might see more of this type of strategy in machinery involved in physical type actions like power turbines or construction. But as we\u2019re seeing, once the machinery is already deployed and connected, there exist real possibilities of building new business services from the collected data.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of the challenges of IoT is figuring out the value of the data coming from so many connected devices.

The technology is <strong>cotech<\/strong> (all work technologies that are about sharing: co-editing, collaboration, co-curation, etc.).<\/p>\n<p>The trend we&#8217;ve selected for this scenario is the movement toward more autonomy, which is a characteristic of agile, distributed, and\/or high performance work.<\/p>\n<p>This trend has led to new requirements\/motifs\/use cases for cotech.<\/p>\n<p>One of the key differences is that more autonomy for individuals and teams is a decrease in the focus on managerial oversight versus peered \u2018undersight\u2019. In such use cases we see a need for ways to increase <strong>sousveillance<\/strong> (bottom-up awareness of what others are doing), and a decrease in managerial\u00a0surveillance.

This forms a baseline to then\u00a0create <strong>forecasts<\/strong> about the more distant future.<\/p>\n<p>Note: cotech tools implicitly limit what they \u2018think\u2019 is important by what they allow users to capture and share.

In this case, a forecast I call <strong><em>Conversus<\/em><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The thought here is this: imagine that\u00a0the liberalizing influence\u00a0of greater autonomy at the team level (&#8216;sets&#8217;) may have\u00a0an impact over time at the company level (&#8216;spheres&#8217;), which may lead to increasingly democratic management disciplines. This could be characterized as one of the features of &#8216;postnormal&#8217; management disciplines.<\/p>\n<p>This change in management thinking and behavior &#8212; and the likely distribution of decision-making to larger networks &#8212;\u00a0reflects back on other aspects of the triangulation. In particular, cotech vendors may start\u00a0to more explicitly support that sort of decision-making at a greater than team scale, where the changes in\u00a0is more implicit.<\/p>\n<p>This is a forecast, since it is a projection from a current day or near-term scenario to something longer range, like 3-5 years out, as in this case. We also explicitly change one or more of the factors, in this case changing social scale of the cotech and autonomy to company-wide.<\/p>\n<p>As I mentioned, this is the forecast I am calling <em>Conversus<\/em>, a coinage intended to indicate a balance of consensus and dissent in postnormal work philosophy.<\/p>\n<p>That shift represents a movement away from &#8216;charismatic&#8217; and &#8216;traditional authority&#8217; to &#8216;legal\/rational authority&#8217;, as characterized by the political philosopher Max Weber in\u00a0<em>The Three Types of Legitimate Rule <\/em>(1922)<em>.<\/em>\u00a0I like how\u00a0Dana Williams <a href=\"http:\/\/danawilliams2.tripod.com\/authority.html\">characterized it<\/a>,<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-legal-rational-autho26\" ><p>Legal-rational authority is empowered by a formalistic belief in the content of the law (legal) or natural law (rationality).

Triangulation is like a Tinkertoy modeling set, for fooling around with constructing, analyzing, and deconstructing futures. As you can see it has a sort of algebra or set-theoretic notation that can be used to spark thinking and pose questions. (What does this &#8212; {Cotech U IoT, ^Mobility, World}, or, in English, the convergence\u00a0of cotech and the Internet of Things plus increased mobility, operating at the scale of our entire society &#8212; make you think of? Don&#8217;t be scared! There are no wrong answers, but there are hundreds of plausible forecasts that could be spun.)<\/li>\n<li>At\u00a0Gigaom Research, I will be leading a push to develop two dozen or so scenarios and forecasts to help organize how we segregate and aggregate our research and writing. So <strong><em>Conversus<\/em><\/strong> and <strong>Work Chat<\/strong> will be two themes &#8212; or taxa (from taxonomy)\u00a0&#8212; we will be returning to time and again, along with other more commonplace ones &#8212; like <strong>Mobility<\/strong> and The <strong>Internet of Things (IoT)<\/strong>.

And in that case, a major hiccup in the market or a company scandal could obliterate the impact of a CEO on operational results.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: helvetica;width: 33%;float: right;font-size: 130%;line-height: 120%;margin: 10px;padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;background: #dddddd\">Fitza&#8217;s research suggests that as much as 70% of the &#8216;CEO Effect&#8217; touted in other, more CEO-favorable studies could be attributed to outright chance, not connections, skill, charisma, or mojo.<\/span>Fitza applied statistical techniques, in particular variance decomposition, to determine the influence of difference factors on a central variable, such as company performance.

Martin Winterkorn was rapidly pushed out at Volkswagen immediately following the &#8216;Dieselgate&#8217; scandal, which might have been considered just a bit of bad luck. He, in fact, asserted that he knew nothing of the company&#8217;s efforts to circumvent emissions testing on certain of the company&#8217;s various lines of diesel automobiles and trucks using so-called &#8216;defeat devices&#8217;. However, since the cheating on nitrogen oxide emissions appears to have been going on since at least 2009, this is not on par with a quarter or two of bad financial results, and it is so far-ranging and so integral to VW&#8217;s efforts to grow the adoption of diesel vehicles in the US that is is difficult to imagine how Winterkorn could not have known. Winterkorn was not undone by luck, but by his misdeeds.<\/p>\n<p>There is no doubt that at least that the truly top performers &#8212; Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Elon Musk &#8212; are worth the astronomical value that their boards, shareholders and the markets are willing to pay. But once you slide down the exponential peak of ability Fitza&#8217;s research says that we are overpaying CEOs. And more importantly, we may be allowing CEOs to try to rig the game to cover up for their inadequacies, and to create power cliques that support them in this.<\/p>\n<p>Recent revelations about Winterkorn seem to show him concealing information about Dieselgate from his board of directors even as they were approving a new contract for him. As reported by Jack Ewing and Jad Mouawad,<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-several-members-expr28\" >[&#8230;] Several members expressed displeasure with Mr. Winterkorn\u2019s failure to keep them in the loop. Mr. Weil, the prime minister of Lower Saxony, complained about it in a speech last week to the state Parliament.<\/p>\n<p>Volkswagen is the largest company by far in the state and employs about 110,000 people there. The state government [Lower Saxony] owns a 20 percent stake in Volkswagen, and by law has veto power over major decisions.<\/p>\n<p>Under German law, at least half of the seats on a company supervisory board are held by labor representatives. A spokesman for members of Volkswagen\u2019s workers\u2019 council, which is separate from the union and also has seats on the board, said he did not know how they learned of the emissions scandal and could not comment.<\/p>\n<p>At Volkswagen, four of the 20 board seats are held by descendants of Ferdinand Porsche, designer of the original Beetle. The family owns a majority of Volkswagen shares through a holding company. A spokesman for the holding company declined to comment.<\/p>\n<p>Volkswagen executives had a duty to inform the supervisory board of the emissions problem, said Ulrich Hocker, a D\u00fcsseldorf lawyer who is president of a shareholder advocacy group known by its German initials, D.S.W. But he said only the supervisory board would have legal standing to seek damages from Mr. Winterkorn, who has kept a low profile since leaving.<\/p>\n<p>Some shareholders have complained that Volkswagen did not follow German laws requiring it to publicize information that could affect the stock price.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Hocker said shareholders are angry and want changes. \u201cThe whole company was run from Wolfsburg,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to get away from this centralized management.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: helvetica;width: 33%;float: right;font-size: 130%;line-height: 120%;margin: 10px;padding: 10px 10px 10px 10px;background: #dddddd\">The reality is that truly great CEOs can have an exponential upside impact, but even an average CEO can damage a company exponentially.<\/span>That last statement is telling, and suggests we have to look beyond CEOs&#8217; generalized abilities, and specifically dig into the many factors in strategic management that CEOs get credited for, like inheriting or engendering\u00a0the right kind of culture.

Those that chuckle typically view hybrid as a phrase used by vendors and customers who have no cloud strategy at all. But hybrid is real and here to stay. Not only is it here to stay, but the hybrid cloud will also reshape cloud computing forever.<\/p>\n<p>People today imagine public cloud to be an \u201camorphous, infinitely scalable computing ether.\u201d They think moving to the cloud rids themselves of the need to detail with computing specificity and that cloud makes you location, risk and model independent. They think enterprises that move to the cloud no longer need to depend on pesky IT departments and deal with risks associated with centralized computing. This perception of computing independence and scale couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.<\/p>\n<p>The promise of cloud is one where anyone who needs compute and storage can get it in an available, as-needed, and robust manner. Cloud computing providers have perfected availability to the point where, even with occasional mass outages, they outperform the service-level agreements (SLAs) of internal IT departments. This does come at a cost, however.<\/p>\n<p>Cloud computing is arguably the largest centralization of technology the world has ever seen and will see. For whatever reason, many people don\u2019t immediately realize that the cloud is centralized, something that should be heavily scrutinized. Possibly because the marketing behind cloud can be vague and lacking a description of a tangible \u201cplace.\u201d Don\u2019t be fooled.<\/p>\n<p>When an enterprise selects a cloud vendor, they\u2019re committing to that provider in a meaningful way. As applications are built for or migrated to a cloud, switching cost gets very high. The nature of this market is driven by a network effect where, assuming all else is equal, each prospective customer of a cloud provider (AWS, Microsoft, etc.) benefits by consuming a cloud that has many of customers over one that has fewer since it indicates lower risk and helps drive the economies that make a given cloud attractive.<\/p>\n<p>If we play this future out, we\u2019ll likely see the cloud infrastructure market collapse to just a few massive, global providers. This will partly be driven by success of the individual providers and the consolidation of smaller players who have great technology but simply can\u2019t compete at that scale. Just take a look at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/vmware-plunges-20-after-emc-details-virtustream-cloud-spinoff-2015-10-21\">acquisition of Virtustream by EMC<\/a> just prior to <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/10\/12\/the-dell-emc-deal-is-huge-but-wheres-it-headed\/\">Dell\u2019s acquisition of EMC<\/a> for a recent example.<\/p>\n<p>A look at recent market share estimates show exactly that, with Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, and Google accounting for 50 percent of the global cloud infrastructure market. One day, these five vendors will likely account for 80 percent of the market. Compare that to the often-criticized banking world, where despite the massive size of today\u2019s banks, the list of banks that hold 50 percent of global deposits is much longer than just five banks. If we applied the same standard to cloud computing, we\u2019d certainly be infuriated and demanding that these \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d computing providers be broken up.<\/p>\n<p>To be clear, I\u2019m not suggesting that what\u2019s happening is bad or that public cloud is bad, but rather to point out the realistic state of cloud computing and the risk created by centralizing control to just a few providers. Cloud would likely never have succeeded without a few key companies making massive bets. The idea of a truly decentralized, global cloud would likely have been the wrong starting point.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s explore the idea that a global decentralized cloud, or something more decentralized than what we have now, is the likely end state. Breaking up cloud providers isn\u2019t necessary or optimal. Unlike banking, technology is capable of layers of abstraction to mitigate these sorts of centralized risks.<\/p>\n<p>Most large enterprises looking to adopt cloud are making two large considerations in their decision process:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>They can\u2019t shut down their entire IT department and replace it with cloud. There are many practical reasons why this is unlikely.<\/li>\n<li>Many are keenly aware of the risks associated with depending on a single vendor for all their cloud computing needs.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The first consideration makes it difficult to adopt a public cloud without at least considering how to reconcile the differences with on-premises, and the second makes it difficult to choose one provider at a level that is incompatible with another provider. The result of centralization in public cloud providers and looking for symmetry between off- and on-premises computing strategies is driving enterprises to explore (and in some cases demand) hybrid capabilities in layers that abstract away infrastructure. In fact, hybrid has transformed to be synonymous with multi-cloud.<\/p>\n<p>Technical layers like enterprise PaaS software platforms and Cloud Management Platforms have evolved to allow for multi-cloud capabilities to cater to a modality where resources are abstract. Over the coming years, we\u2019ll likely see multi-cloud features in these technology layers to lead to a much more decentralized computing model where something like a PaaS layer will fuse resources from public clouds, on-premises infrastructure, and regional infrastructure providers into logical clouds.<\/p>\n<p>At least in the enterprise space, \u201cprivate clouds\u201d will really be an amalgam of resources and will behave as the single, \u201camorphous ether\u201d that we tend to assign cloud to begin with. The cloud market will not be one where five vendors control all the compute and customers are at the mercy of the vendors. Instead, cloud will be consumed through multi-cloud layers that will protect customers from inherent centralization risk. The end state is a decentralized model with control points owned by the customer through software \u2013 a drastic reshaping to say the least.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sinclair Schuller is the CEO and cofounder of\u00a0Apprenda, a leader in enterprise Platform as a Service.

That last item is by far the most interesting &#8212; and the one most likely to worry Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter often bills itself as\u00a0a forum for public conversations. Unless someone makes their entire account private, every 140-characters-or-fewer missive is indexed and can be found by anyone using the service&#8217;s\u00a0search function. This makes it relatively easy to find and participate in active conversations &#8212; especially when used in conjunction with hashtags, Twitter&#8217;s defining mark. Facebook has basically just recreated one of the most useful parts of Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>I doubt this will convince Twitter users to suddenly use Facebook as a\u00a0home for their pithy, snarky-or-smarmy remarks about the day&#8217;s news. And that&#8217;s OK. Facebook has many\u00a0times as many monthly active users as Twitter; and with more and more people using services like Instagram or Messenger, it&#8217;s already established itself as the social network of choice for more than a billion people. Now, it just has to make sure those people don&#8217;t have dalliances with other apps.<\/p>\n<p>Put another way: Facebook has just removed another reason people might decide to sign up for\u00a0Twitter instead of remaining content with its services. (Or, at the very least, given casual Twitter users one less\u00a0reason to occasionally stray from Facebook.) The company has become a magician willing to pull anything &#8212; Snapchat clones, standalone messaging apps, improved search tools, etc. &#8212; from its\u00a0hat to prevent its all-but-captive audience from checking out another exhibit.<\/p>\n<p>The changes to Facebook&#8217;s search tool will likely seem weird to people who joined the network\u00a0for the purpose\u00a0of staying in touch with their real-life social circles. But if Twitter and other platforms (like Reddit) have shown us anything, it&#8217;s that many will also want to have conversations with interesting folks\u00a0they&#8217;ve never met, and discuss topics that might not appeal to the people in their daily lives. It&#8217;s\u00a0a very kumbaya-esque mission to connect people with random people who happen to share their interests as well as the people in their everyday lives.<\/p>\n<p>Still, the changes are unlikely\u00a0to make Twitter a ghost town. Twitter users\u00a0have their cliques; they prize their follower counts; and probably value\u00a0having a place where they can express an opinion without repercussion. One of the main things stopping people from having public conversations on Facebook&#8217;s\u00a0platform is the &#8220;real name&#8221; policy that prevents users from hiding their identities. (Or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eff.org\/deeplinks\/2015\/10\/global-coalition-facebook-authentic-names-are-authentically-dangerous-your-users\">in some cases<\/a> embracing their true selves, trying to escape dangerous situations, or simply using whatever unique name their parents gave\u00a0them.)

This improved search feature is just the latest beast it&#8217;s pulled from its hat to do just that.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook is\u00a0updating its search tool to make it easier for users to find things that interest them among the 2 trillion items&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611561,"featured_media":920580,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[359218214,359216305,359221038],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920578"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611561"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920578"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920578\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920580"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920578"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920578"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920578"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920570,"date":"2015-10-22T10:00:55","date_gmt":"2015-10-22T17:00:55","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920570"},"modified":"2015-10-22T09:52:46","modified_gmt":"2015-10-22T16:52:46","slug":"parse-teams-up-with-heroku-to-make-devs-lives-easier","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/10\/22\/parse-teams-up-with-heroku-to-make-devs-lives-easier\/","title":{"rendered":"Parse teams up with Heroku to make devs&#8217; lives easier"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook&#8217;s cloud development platform, Parse, has partnered with Heroku to make it easier for developers to take advantage of both platforms&#8217; capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>Parse announced last month that it would now support Node.js alongside its own Cloud Code, which is based on the same V8 JavaScript engine.

Whether you&#8217;re targeting mobile, embedded devices, or IOT, you&#8217;ve now got new choices on how to build them with Heroku and Parse together.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Parse and Heroku are both popular amongst startups and large companies alike. Connecting the\u00a0platforms could not only make life easier for cloud developers, but could also make both platforms more popular by virtue of cross-promotion.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Parse and Heroku have similar goals \u2014 helping developers build great apps using the best cloud backend tools,&#8221; says Parse product manager Supratik Lahiri. &#8220;Because of this similar focus, our teams have been in touch for a while, and the conversation developed naturally. At Parse, we\u2019ve been looking for ways to make Parse more open and flexible for developers and a Heroku integration was a great way to do that.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Facebook acquired Parse in 2013, just two years after its debut. Wired <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.com\/2013\/09\/facebook-and-parse\/\">characterized the deal<\/a> as Facebook buying its way into the &#8220;heart of the app world&#8221; because so many developers relied on Parse for their mobile apps. It&#8217;s now used by everyone from Cisco and MTV to McDonald&#8217;s and Samsung.<\/p>\n<p>Heroku was founded in 2007, and it&#8217;s used by many startups to build and deploy their Web apps. It was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/salesforcecom-signs-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-heroku-111513604.html\">acquired by Salesforce<\/a>, which spent an approximate $212 million on a startup that raised only $13 million in funding, so it could be &#8220;the cornerstone for the next generation of app developers.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook&#8217;s cloud development platform, Parse, has partnered with Heroku to make it easier for developers to take advantage of both platforms&#8217; capabilities.&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87611561,"featured_media":920577,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[20054,359224510,359221518],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920570"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87611561"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=920570"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/920570\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920577"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=920570"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=920570"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=920570"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":920571,"date":"2015-10-22T09:36:39","date_gmt":"2015-10-22T16:36:39","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=920571"},"modified":"2015-10-22T09:36:39","modified_gmt":"2015-10-22T16:36:39","slug":"instagrams-boomerang-takes-on-vine-apples-live-photos-with-1-second-videos","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/10\/22\/instagrams-boomerang-takes-on-vine-apples-live-photos-with-1-second-videos\/","title":{"rendered":"Instagram&#8217;s Boomerang takes on Vine &amp; Apple&#8217;s Live Photos with 1-second videos"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Instagram has released a new standalone application called <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.instagram.com\/post\/131684343987\/boomerang-from-instagram\" target=\"_blank\">Boomerang<\/a>. It allows users to share 1-second video clips with their friends, effectively taking the &#8220;don&#8217;t-call-them-GIFs&#8221; animations from Vine and chopping them into sixths.<\/p>\n<p>Boomerang &#8220;takes a burst of photos and stitches them together into a high-quality mini video that plays forward and backward,&#8221; according to the blog post announcing the app, automatically saving\u00a0the result to a user&#8217;s camera roll. The brief animations can also (of course) be shared to Instagram&#8217;s main app.<\/p>\n<p>Boomerang users won&#8217;t have to sign in to Instagram to use the app, according a TechCrunch <a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/10\/22\/instagram-boomerang\/\">report<\/a>. It&#8217;s supposed to be a lightweight tool that does one thing &#8212; capture a short video &#8212; and one thing only. Instagram users who see a video made with Boomerang in their feeds, however, will be shown a link to download the app.<\/p>\n<p>This is the third\u00a0standalone application Instagram has introduced since it was acquired by Facebook. The first was <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.instagram.com\/post\/95829278497\/hyperlapse-from-instagram\">Hyperlapse<\/a>, a video recording app that makes it easy to shoot time lapses and other edited videos; the second was <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.instagram.com\/post\/114416360957\/layout-from-instagram\">Layout<\/a>, which allows people to share photo collages to Instagram proper.<\/p>\n<p>All\u00a0of these apps could have been included as features in Instagram&#8217;s primary app. But, <a href=\"https:\/\/pando.com\/2015\/03\/23\/instagrams-layout-helps-facebook-take-over-your-phone-one-app-at-a-time\/\">as I explained<\/a> when Layout was announced, breaking them into pieces makes it easier for Facebook to lay claim to more of a person&#8217;s home screen:<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"quote-facebook-knows-that-\"><p>Facebook knows that a smartphone home screen has limited space, and if it manages to make at least some of [its copycat services like Slingshot or Rooms] stick, it can take control of mobile devices without having to make\u00a0its own platform. Until then, all it has to do is rip\u00a0various aspects of its service\u00a0out from its &#8216;big blue app.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s where Instagram comes in. The service was so simple when it was acquired that many additional features can be introduced as standalone apps and explained away by claiming it doesn&#8217;t want to make things complicated. It gets to take over people&#8217;s smartphones, those people get access to new apps, and Facebook gets to control even more of the home screen. Everyone wins.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Sure, Boomerang\u00a0mimics something the new iPhones can already do with Apple&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/iphone-6s\/cameras\/\">Live Photos<\/a>. (That might be part of Boomerang&#8217;s appeal, actually; no need to buy a new phone just to make fancier animated GIFs.) Sure, the videos are shorter than Vine&#8217;s and make it seem\u00a0a bit like Instagram&#8217;s playing catch-up.<\/p>\n<p>But that won&#8217;t matter if people have fun with Boomerang. Instagram has enough users who want to find new ways to express themselves that it can probably get thousands of Boomerang downloads in just a few short hours. Then Instagram is happy, Facebook is happy, and consumers are happy. That&#8217;s how companies take over a home screen &#8212; one quirky little app at a time.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Instagram has released a new standalone application called Boomerang.

You know, the ones that claim to be all-natural and contain 100 percent <em>beef<\/em>? The truly unnerving thing about hot dogs is you still don&#8217;t quite know if spending a few extra bucks means you&#8217;re getting something more healthy.\u00a0It&#8217;s something food analysis startup <a href=\"https:\/\/www.clearlabs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Clear Labs<\/a> aims to do something about, and today has launched a crowdfunding campaign to make it happen.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s often weird when venture-backed startups turn to crowdfunding platforms. Somehow it feels like someone double-dipping a potato chip: There&#8217;s no law against it, but it&#8217;s hard not to feel a little grossed out when you see it happen. Clear Labs, a food analytics company hoping to raise $100,000 on Kickstarter shortly after <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2015\/09\/15\/whats-in-your-food-clear-labs-nabs-6-5m-to-help-the-food-industry-find-out\/\">receiving $6.5 million<\/a> in funding, knows this might be the case.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As is typical for most venture-backed startups,&#8221; co-founder Mahni Ghorashi told me, &#8220;we raised just enough to hit our milestones and get the company where it needs to be for the next round of financing.&#8221; The costs of making the consumer-facing reports Clear Labs\u00a0will\u00a0make when\u00a0the Kickstarter campaign finishes weren&#8217;t included in the financial model the company used to fundraise.<\/p>\n<p>First, a little more about the reports themselves. Clear Labs was founded to analyze on a molecular level the foods people might find in grocery stores. The company is currently focused on selling its services to members of the supply chain, but it&#8217;s introducing\u00a0a Clear Food division that will tell consumers about all the potentially gross things they&#8217;re picking up off the grocery store shelves.<\/p>\n<p>This will be a costly endeavor. For each report Clear Labs needs to buy foods, catalog them, run it through a series of tests, then analyze the results against its own database and several public domain databases it uses to inform its findings. When all this is done the company will assign different brands a Clear Score ranging from zero to 100, which is supposed to indicate the accuracy of the brand&#8217;s labeling in terms of ingredients, nutrients, and other information.<\/p>\n<p>Clear Labs\u00a0estimates this will cost $10,000 per report; the campaign will fund 10 of these reports, which will be published once a month, after which the hope is they&#8217;ll be funded in other ways. (The idea is that revenues from the business-focused side of Clear Labs will be able to subsidize reports after the first 10.)<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;After these first 10 reports, we kind of see consumers demanding more and more transparency in the industry and having a bigger say in what does the industry adopt,&#8221; Ghorashi said. &#8220;The cadence might slow down a bit, given that we&#8217;re not crowdfunding additional reports, but we still hope to keep the initiative going and to provide value to consumers on an ongoing basis.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Ghorashi and his co-founder, Sasan Amini, also say the consumer-facing reports could help Clear Labs land more enterprise customers. Turning to Kickstarter is supposed to make consumers even more interested in learning more about their food; backers will be able to choose the categories examined by Clear Labs, and having a little skin in the game is a sure way to keep people&#8217;s attentions focused.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also the potential gross factor associated with each category. The first report focused on hot dogs &#8212; probably the most disgusting foodstuff on Earth &#8212; and claims made by different brands. It found that many &#8220;vegetarian&#8221; dogs aren&#8217;t, that a small percentage of hot dogs contained human DNA, and that hot dogs supposedly made from something other than pork do, in fact, contain pork. (That&#8217;s the kind of <em>shit<\/em>\u00a0&#8212; possibly literally, in terms of the human DNA &#8212; people like to gross each other out with on Facebook and viral email threads.)<\/p>\n<p>Clear Labs will have to overcome the stigma of a fairly-well-funded startup turning to the masses for even more money. But once it does that, it&#8217;s not hard to see the company&#8217;s reports becoming popular among people curious about their food.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re super excited to launch Clear Food on Kickstarter and start to measure consumer demand,&#8221; Ghorashi said, &#8220;and we believe the data we&#8217;re going to publish over the next six to 12 months will grab consumer attention, and the attention of industry as well.&#8221; That&#8217;s probably the understatement of the year.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Have you ever spent a little more money on a supposed &#8220;premium&#8221; brand of hot dogs?
