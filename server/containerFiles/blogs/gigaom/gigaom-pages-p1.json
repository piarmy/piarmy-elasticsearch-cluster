And when the topic turns to AI, as it invariably does, the most common question we get is &#8220;How do I figure out where to start?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This is understandable. AI is a broad, broad concept. The technologies that make up the state of the art are new and relatively few people have experience in more than a couple of them. But the challenges don\u2019t end there: In addition to technology uncertainty, enterprises just don\u2019t know where in the organization to begin applying this technology. Where can AI provide the biggest boost to ROI for the least work?<\/p>\n<p>We get these questions so often, that we have decided to help enterprises answer them in a very direct way, with our new Gigaom AI Assessment. Here\u2019s how it works:<\/p>\n<p>We visit your company and spend time just understanding your business and its goals. Then, we do an inventory and scoring of the data sources at your disposal, as well as the opportunities (and challenges) that are before you.<\/p>\n<p>Then, returning to Gigaom HQ, we package all of that, along with analysis and recommendations in a report for you that outlines specific projects you might consider, along with broad suggestions on the technologies you might deploy.<\/p>\n<p>The team that works with you in all of this is:<\/p>\n<p>Byron Reese, Gigaom publisher. Author of a forthcoming book about AI called <em>The Fourth Age,<\/em> and long-time AI practitioner and patent holder.<\/p>\n<p>Chris Moritz is a lifelong entrepreneur and technologist with a number of successful businesses under his belt. Since 2009, Chris has been building and leveraging artificial intelligence systems to cognify a wide range of business functions.<\/p>\n<p>Pricing for this onsite visit varies by location and specific circumstances.\u00a0\u00a0If you are interested, email us at <strong><a href=\"mailto:&#97;i&#64;g&#105;gaom.co&#109;\">&#97;i&#64;g&#105;gaom.co&#109;<\/a>\u00a0<\/strong>and let&#8217;s start talking about how you can use AI in your business right now.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At Gigaom, we have occasion to meet with enterprises frequently.

Our mission is simple: Help companies identify opportunities where AI can fuel growth in their business.\u00a0<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nMany of the companies we work with are just getting oriented in AI and are beginning to figure out where to start. That\u2019s why we have developed our one-day on-site AI boot camp.\u00a0<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nThe day is divided into two halves. The first half is a hands-on introduction to AI. This is a real &#8220;roll up your sleeves and dive in&#8221;\u00a0workshop that will give teams a working knowledge of what you can do with cloud-based AI offerings from IBM, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and others.<\/p>\n<p>It is ideal for managers of all levels.\u00a0We start at\u00a09:00\u00a0and by\u00a01:00, everyone will be speaking the same language and have a working understanding of the capabilities of the key AI platforms, including what works right now and what doesn&#8217;t.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nThen in the second half of the day, we do an opportunity assessment for your company. We look throughout your enterprise for places where AI can make a big difference right now. The emphasis here is finding low-hanging fruit with clearly measurable ROIs.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2>Sample Workshop Sessions<\/h2>\n<p>Build real-world AI solutions using the latest technologies from Amazon Echo, IBM Watson, Google, Microsoft, and open source options.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Predictive Customer\/Lead Engagement<\/strong> \u2013 Really powerful use case for AI in operations.

Sure, it could only handle six pieces and required fifteen seconds to make a move, but it played chess. This was a watershed event in the history of computers. Why? Because for many, it was an &#8220;aha!&#8221; moment that showed computers were something more than merely programmable number crunchers. This shift in thinking, which seems so obvious to us today, marked the beginning of the modern computer age. <\/p>\n<p>As much of a visionary as he was, even Shannon would no doubt be surprised at how computers have permeated the world. Literally no one knows how many there are in the world. You likely own hundreds of microprocessors, each quietly performing some function that makes your life a little better. <\/p>\n<p>But as transformative as this technology has been so far, we have only seen a warm-up act for what is about to happen due to the power of artificial intelligence. In just a decade or so, people will look back at our time and see our belief that we lived in the &#8220;computer age&#8221; as kind of quaint. The difference between what those hundred microprocessors do for you today compared to what they will be able to do when they are animated by the power of AI is unfathomable from today&#8217;s vantage point.<\/p>\n<p>What is certain is this: AI will transform everything&#8211;every business, every department, every job, everything. Each of the thousands of daily decisions that you make or that are made on your behalf will become dramatically better in a world of artificial intelligence. The cumulative effect that this will have on your life, as well as on the planet as a whole, dwarfs the imagination.<\/p>\n<p>At Gigaom, our mission is to provide enterprises with information and analysis to help them make better decisions about technology. Given this mission, you can understand why we are so excited about AI. It exists to help us make better decisions. <\/p>\n<p>We believe that the rapid adoption of AI by enterprises is essential to their success. AI is as profound in its implications as electricity, and just as one cannot imagine a business deciding not to use not electricity or taking a \u201cwait and see\u201d attitude about it, companies that don&#8217;t rethink every department on their org chart in light of this new technology are at risk at being displaced by their more agile competitors. Technologies like AI are double-edged swords: On the one hand, adopting them will lead to vast increases in efficiency and profitability. On the other hand, it gives those same benefits to all of your competitors as well. With technologies as transformative as AI, it is a race to see who can implement them the best and fastest. <\/p>\n<p>Because of this, we have created and launched Gigaom AI Labs to help organizations implement this technology today. We will work directly with our clients on projects that implement AI in ways that will deliver measurable results. From strategy to coding to rollout, we will be with our clients every step of the way. <\/p>\n<p>If you have a project in mind for your organization that could be enhanced with artificial intelligence, perhaps we can work together on it.

I am the publisher of Gigaom.<\/p>\n<p>I have always loved technology. As a kid, I was always taking stuff apart to figure out how it worked. I grew convinced that I must have a knack for engineering because whenever I would put something back together, I always had a few pieces leftover. If that isn&#8217;t talent, I don&#8217;t know what is.<\/p>\n<p>Like many people that are fascinated by technology, I loved science fiction. I was, and still am, a big Star Trek fan. Years ago, I read a quote by the creator of Star Trek, Gene Roddenberry. He said that in the future, &#8220;There would be no hunger, there would be no greed, and all the children will know how to read.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This quote gnawed at me, and I wondered if it was true. Or did it just sound true because it <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rhyme-as-reason_effect\">rhymed<\/a>. So I decided to try to figure it out. That&#8217;s how I became a futurist.<\/p>\n<p>I got into business early in life. \u00a0When I was 12, my mom asked me to paint our house number on our curb with a stencil. Our neighbor, Mr. Roland, saw me doing it and asked me to do his as well.\u00a0 Afterwards gave me $5. Five bucks! For five minutes work. In 1980! I remember hearing a distinct \u201cka-ching\u201d inside my head. I immediately started going door-to-door, and made a kid-sized fortune. I have been an entrepreneur ever since.<\/p>\n<p>After I had some business success as an adult, I began getting invitations to give talks. Good speakers write a speech and give it over and over. I am not a good speaker. I have never given the same speech twice. I just can\u2019t bring myself to do it&#8230; it feels like I am phoning it in. So, I would give talks about whatever I was interested in at the time. After a while, I noticed that the same themes were coming up over and over. Suddenly that collection of speeches looked a lot like a book. That&#8217;s how I became an author. My upcoming book is about AI and is called &#8220;The Fourth Age: Smart Robots, Conscious Computers, and the Future of Humanity.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why being the publisher of Gigaom is my dream job. I get to explore the intersection of technology, business, and the future. And here at the Publisher&#8217;s Corner, you can read my various musings on these topics.

Given this mission, you can understand why we are so excited about AI. It exists to help us make better decisions and we believe that the rapid adoption of AI by enterprises is essential to success.  Here at Publisher\u2019s Corner, you will find a curated collection of my bylined articles on artificial intelligence and a good number of interviews with today\u2019s AI thought leaders. <\/p>\n<p>You might have noticed a new focus in our content on AI, machine learning, and cognitive computing, including our 2016 conference Gigaom Ai. Why? Because as transformative as this artificial intelligence has been so far, we have only seen a warm-up act for what is about to happen. With this in mind, I invite you to return here often for my latest articles and interviews exploring the impact of AI on business, employment, education, law, health, humanity and of course the future. I invite you to come along.  <\/p>\n<p><strong>Recent Posts<\/strong><\/p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"latest-posts\">\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2017\/08\/07\/announcing-voices-in-ai-podcast\/\" title=\"Announcing \u201cVoices in AI\u201d Podcast\">Announcing \u201cVoices in AI\u201d Podcast<\/a><\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2017\/06\/12\/amazons-alexa-vs-googles-assistant-same-questions-different-answers\/\" title=\"Amazon\u2019s Alexa vs. Google\u2019s Assistant: Same Questions, Different Answers\">Amazon\u2019s Alexa vs. Google\u2019s Assistant: Same Questions, Different Answers<\/a><\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/episode\/gigaom-ai-minute-june-4\/\" title=\"Gigaom AI Minute &#8211;

On the other hand, it gives those same benefits to all of your competitors as well. With technologies as transformative as AI, it is a race to see who can implement them the best and fastest. <\/p>\n<p>What is certain is this: AI will transform everything\u2013every business, every department, every job, everything. AI is as profound in its implications as electricity, and just as one cannot imagine a business taking a \u201cwait and see\u201d attitude about electricity, companies that don\u2019t rethink every department on their org chart in light of this new technology are at risk at being displaced by their more agile competitors.<\/p>\n<p>In response, we have also created and launched Gigaom AI Labs to help organizations implement AI immediately, in ways that will deliver measurable results today. From strategy to coding, to rollout, we are with our clients every step of the way.
