Marketing and Communications at PEER 1 and ServerBeach about what\u2019s happening at PEER 1 now and what\u2019s to come in 2010.<\/p>\n<h4>MS: Rajan, what is new at PEER 1?<\/h4>\n<p>RS: PEER 1 recently expanded into the United Kingdom with it\u2019s 16th data center to better serve the UK and EMEA markets. We are also currently building out our 17th data center in Toronto, Canada scheduled to open in 2010. This will become our flagship data center, using green technology and infrastructure, while serving up Managed Hosting, Dedicated Hosting and Colocation services.<\/p>\n<h4>MS: How did PEER 1 take off?<\/h4>\n<p>RS: We were an early adopter of social media that used forums, blogs, Facebook, and YouTube to developed a community around our brands PEER 1 and ServerBeach. In 2007, we launched a successful short series entirely online called \u201cGrowing Pains\u201d that went viral and since received several advertising awards. We\u2019ve now been active on Twitter and expirementing with ways of turning it into a successful marketing medium without annoying our followers. Four months ago, we launched a weekly \u201c48HR Twitter Promo\u201d where we give out a gift like a Netbook or Slingbox to any new customer that signs up between Wed 6pm EST and Fri 6pm EST. It started off slow, but has really taken off in the last 2 months. We think we\u2019ve found the balance between communicating\/sharing news\/tips\/updates and offering up a promo. Scheduling it at the same time every week so followers know when to expect it seems to have worked.<\/p>\n<h4>MS: Why do you use GigaOM for your marketing?<\/h4>\n<p>RS: I met Om Malik at Office 2.0 in 2007. I was already an avid reader of his blog, but after meeting him, I felt PEER 1 would benefit greatly from being more closely associated with him. We started off as a small sponsor of NewTeeVee which then turned into the headline sponsorship of the first Structure 08, as well as this past Structure 09. I was very impressed with the calibre of people Om reaches and clearly saw the benefit of using GigaOM as a marketing channel to raise our profile. I haven\u2019t been wrong.<\/p>\n<h4>MS: How Does the future look for PEER 1?<\/h4>\n<p>RS: The future looks incredibly bright for PEER 1. More and more people know who we are, and are impressed with the quality and value of our hosting. Our SuperNetwork(TM), FirstCall Support(TM) promise, and range of hosting choices resonates strongly with the SMB marketplace and we\u2019re obsessed with serving them better than any other provider.<\/p>\n<p>Interview from July 2009<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We started off as a small sponsor of NewTeeVee which then turned into the headline sponsorship of the first Structure 08, as well as this past Structure 09. I was very impressed with the calibre of people Om reaches and clearly saw the benefit of using GigaOM as a marketing channel to raise our profile.

Games take a lot of space. Not just on hard drives, but in memory. Valve has been carefully monitoring available storage and RAM since the start of their study.<\/p>\n<p>The storage analysis demands a bit of explanation. In each survey, Steam puts total and available storage into \u201cbuckets\u201d such as \u201c70-79.9 GBytes.\u201d These charts look at the relative percentage of respondents who fell into each bucket. In other words, if more people fell into the 80-89.9 GByte bucket in December, 2004, then that bar would be the tallest.<\/p>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/\/2008\/03\/total-and-available-desktop-storage-2004-to-2008.gif\" title=\"total-and-available-desktop-storage-2004-to-2008.gif\"><img src=\"http:\/\/\/2008\/03\/total-and-available-desktop-storage-2004-to-2008.gif\" alt=\"total-and-available-desktop-storage-2004-to-2008.gif\" \/><\/a>\n<p>Desktop storage has grown significantly over the course of the survey, with \u201cspikes\u201d at common drive sizes \u2014 40, 80, and 120 GBytes, for example. Despite this, most users seem to have 10-20 GBytes free.<\/p>\n<p>Nearly all of that storage is formatted NTFS.

MSN is integral to our Online Services success. It&#8217;s our key service to attract and engage users through online content experiences and direct network traffic, and is our single largest source of Ad Revenue.  Joanne and team presented a plan at our annual strategy review in December to transform MSN into a next generation Portal &#8211; a software engine that delivers the most relevant and social online content experience.  This vision builds on the core MSN strengths in media programming\/editorial, web user experience design and publishing systems by incorporating all of the web corpus and social media. The key innovation will be around driving user centric content experiences powered by unique editorial voice and deep mining of content\/search, usage and social graph. I am personally excited about having the opportunity to work with the team on moving this vision forward into implementation and helping align our editorial, data, infrastructure and algorithmic assets\/efforts across our teams.<\/p>\n<p>Our respective FY 08 organizational and individual commitments remain the same. We need to stay focused on our current releases and business.<\/p>\n<p>Our mission in SPAG is to create unique breakthroughs in consumer online audience experiences and Ad Platform.<\/p>\n<p>We will continue to execute on the following top level objectives:<br \/>\n1.       Develop a destination search experience with broad usage and distinct differentiation<br \/>\n2.       Reinvent MSN portal experience to drive growth of audience &#038; engagement across the network<br \/>\n3.       Build Ad platform scale, advertising value, and targeting capability<br \/>\n4.       Share assets in infrastructure, data and algorithms-  across Search, Portal and Advertising<br \/>\n5.       Develop an culture that puts a premium on innovation, agility, openness &#038;  fun<\/p>\n<p>We will build out our FY 09 commitments and plans using the above top level objectives in collaboration with our business &#038; marketing colleagues.<\/p>\n<p>We are going through a period of intense roadmap execution, while also having to deal with organizational change and the news of our proposal to acquire Yahoo. I first want to acknowledge that all this does cause anxiety. All of us want to know that what we are working on has deep meaning and impact. I want to assure you that it does. I want us to face up to any and all change knowing that winning in Search, Portals and Advertising is the top order bit that is critical for us and our company.   Our investment and focus on innovation in Search, Portals and Advertising will continue, independent of changes to our team or in the company. We should also recognize that we are living in a  &#8220;golden age&#8221; when it comes to innovation in these categories. Therefore let&#8217;s focus on innovation and work ahead knowing that each release and each step of progress in delivering additional value to our customers is what will ultimately define our success!<\/p>\n<p>Please feel send me email with any questions, comments or issues.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\n&#8211;<br \/>\nSatya<\/p>\n<p>The Microsoft Memos Sent Out Today By:<\/p>\n<p>* <a href=\"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/microsoft-memos\/steve-ballmer-reorg-memo\/\">Steve Ballmer Memo<\/a><br \/>\n* <a href=\"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/microsoft-memos\/kevin-johnson-memo\/\">Kevin Johnson Memo<\/a><br \/>\n* <a href=\"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/microsoft-memos\/satya-nadella-memo\/\">Satya Nadella Memo<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Satya Nadella I would like to welcome the MSN team to the Search, Portal and Advertising Group (SPAG).

We clearly operate in a dynamic, fast-moving marketplace with many great competitors including Apple, Google, and several open source offerings.<\/p>\n<p>In December, we completed our annual strategy review which outlined the strategic priorities across our business as we look to continue our growth and compete in the market.  In the Windows business, we have surpassed 100M units of Windows Vista, and Windows Vista SP1 has released to manufacturing.  We are seeing an uptick in enterprise licensing, along with great progress on IE 8 and Windows 7 engineering plans.<\/p>\n<p>The online services business has experienced growth in online advertising revenue above the industry average, the Windows Live suite has seen good adoption, MSN is growing depth of usage, and we have signed up many publishers to our advertising platform.<\/p>\n<p>Even with this progress though, there are many areas that we must improve on.  Coming out of the strategy review, there are three key areas that are top of mind for me:<\/p>\n<p>Transforming how we connect with consumers<br \/>\nGiven our dynamic marketplace, we must transform how we connect with consumers.   I can point to several areas where we can do a better job of delivering experiences and creating an emotional connection with the consumer.  We have revamped our engineering approach and the team is making progress on key user scenarios across the PC, phone, and Web.  As we look to the future, we must reinvent our approach to consumer marketing, the pre-sales experience, the way we work collaboratively with our PC partners, and how we communicate our brand and what it stands for.  To do this, we will make changes to bring all consumer audience marketing across PSD into a single organization.  This will enable us to align marketing resources, eliminate silos, communicate the end-to-end experiences, and better connect with consumers.<\/p>\n<p>Taking the next step in our integration plan with aQuantive to increase value to advertisers and publishers.<br \/>\nWe announced our acquisition of aQuantive in May 2007, and closed on the deal in August, forming the Advertiser &#038; Publisher Solutions Group (APS).  Since that time we&#8217;ve signed over 60 publishers on our advertising platform, and shown progress on Microsoft&#8217;s commitment to online advertising.<\/p>\n<p>Now, we are able to progress naturally from this first phase of the aQuantive integration.  For advertisers &#038; publishers, we must develop focused marketing and value propositions, and this is a key mission for the APS team.<\/p>\n<p>Our goal has been to align the Microsoft Digital Advertising Solutions (MDAS) and all publisher business development with the APS organization to better serve our advertiser and publisher customers.  In all cases, our advertising platform must scale to serve both first party Microsoft properties such as MSN and Office Live, as well as third parties including Viacom, Facebook, Dow Jones, CNBC, and Digg.  Building and operating this ad platform must also include focusing on customer satisfaction through better alignment of our sales and service capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>Enhancing our global focus on consumers, advertisers, and publishers<br \/>\nToday, looking globally, our sales and marketing organizations are not as well aligned by customer segment as needed, particularly as we compete in the consumer segment with companies such as Apple and Google.<\/p>\n<p>Our online advertising sales and marketing capabilities are strong in North America and Western Europe.  As emerging markets and Asian markets continue their growth in technology usage, the online ad opportunity in these markets will grow as well.  In our field organizations, we recognize a need to align resources across our consumer, advertiser, and publisher sales and marketing organizations, to better connect with consumers, grow our software royalty business, and expand our rapidly growing online advertising capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>PSD Organization Structure<\/p>\n<p>Continuing to build our leadership capacity is essential to drive PSD&#8217;s growth and long-term aspirations.  As Steveb&#8217;s mail outlined, Bill and Satya are being promoted and \u2014 working with Brian McAndrews\u2014 will take on expanded responsibilities running business strategy, sales, marketing, and engineering for Windows Live, Search, and MSN.   These changes are examples of deepening our business and engineering functional leadership across the PSD leadership team.<\/p>\n<p>With these changes, I want to share that Steve Berkowitz will be leaving Microsoft to pursue new opportunities at the end of August 2008.  Until then, Steve will support the achievement of the teams&#8217; FY08 commitments, and will consult on the transition to the new PSD organization structure.   I want to thank Steve for his passion and professionalism, and all of his contributions to helping us continue to build the Microsoft online services and advertising business.<\/p>\n<p>I also want to thank Mike Sievert for his leadership, passion, and focus on growth in our Windows Client business, and wish him well as he pursues aspirations outside Microsoft.<\/p>\n<p>In support of our opportunity to better connect with consumers, increase value to advertisers and publishers, and enhance our global focus, we are announcing a set of leadership changes that are effective immediately:<\/p>\n<p>Bill Veghte will lead the Online Services &#038; Windows Business Group, with responsibility for all end user business strategy, sales, and marketing across Windows Client, Windows Live, MSN, and Search.  I expect Bill and his team to strengthen our focus on a set of actions to transform how we market and connect with consumers.  Bill&#8217;s organization will continue to include the Software Protection and Commerce teams, the Unlimited Potential group, and have shared responsibility for OEM sales.<\/p>\n<p>Effective immediately, Bill will take on some additional responsibilities\/teams for online services, including:<\/p>\n<p>Search marketing (Brad Goldberg&#8217;s team)<br \/>\nWindows Live marketing (Brian Hall&#8217;s team); and<br \/>\nThe Business Intelligence\/Customer Intelligence team; the teams responsible for business development and partner management to support our end-user acquisition goals; and the mobile services strategy and marketing team.  (Jon Tinter and a core part of his team)<br \/>\nSatya Nadella will lead the Search, Portals, and Advertising Group (SPAG) and will have end to end content programming &#038; engineering responsibility for Live Search, MSN, and our advertising platform.  This alignment will enable our vision of reinventing our Search and Portal experiences by driving &#8220;Search to Content&#8221; and &#8220;Content to Search&#8221; and also enable the sharing of our data &#038; data mining platform across the portal, search, and advertising teams.<\/p>\n<p>For this move, Joanne Bradford and the MSN organization will move to Satya.  In FY08, MSN has had strong growth in page views, unique users, and minutes of usage.  We are committed to ensuring continued focus for the team so they can deliver a differentiated experience in the market and grow our audience.   The MSN team&#8217;s FY08 commitments and priorities will remain in place.  By the start of FY09, the MSN organization will move to a functional model. Joanne will work with Satya, Bill Veghte and Brian McAndrews on the priority and org alignment for MSN to continue to thrive in FY 09.  To fully align all end-user marketing under Bill, we will move the appropriate MSN product management\/marketing capabilities to the Online Services &#038; Windows Business Group as the team sets up for FY09.<\/p>\n<p>Brian McAndrews continues to lead the Advertiser &#038; Publisher Solutions Group (APS).  As we implement the next phase of our integration plan, Brian will pick up additional responsibilities for online advertising sales, marketing, support, and all publisher business development, which includes:<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7         Global Sales and Marketing (Steve Vamos&#8217; team)<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7         CSO (Anna Collins&#8217; team)<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7         Microsoft Digital Advertising Solutions Business Team (Bill Shaughnessy&#8217;s team); and<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7         The Audience Solutions Team responsible for business development and partner management to support our third party advertising syndication partners.  (Dell Wilkinson and a core part of her team)<\/p>\n<p>Yusuf Mehdi will continue in his role leading key Strategic Partnerships that span multiple aspects of our business.  Yusuf will continue to contribute to PSD strategy and his team will work across the division and the company to pull together important partnerships with named partners.<\/p>\n<p>There are no changes to Steven Sinofsky, Jon DeVaan, or Debra Chrapaty&#8217;s teams, and their commitments remain the same.<\/p>\n<p>With these changes, the PSD leadership team now includes:<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7         Steven Sinofsky, Windows &#038; Windows Live Engineering<br \/>\n\u00b7         Jon DeVaan, Core Operating Systems Division<br \/>\n\u00b7         Satya Nadella, Search, Portals, and Advertising Group<br \/>\n\u00b7         Brian Arbogast, Mobile Services<br \/>\n\u00b7         David Treadwell, Live Platform Services<br \/>\n\u00b7         Amitabh Srivastava, Cloud Infrastructure Services<br \/>\n\u00b7         Debra Chrapaty, Global Foundation Services<br \/>\n\u00b7         Bill Veghte, Online Services &#038; Windows Business Group<br \/>\n\u00b7         Brian McAndrews, Advertiser &#038; Publisher Solutions Group<br \/>\n\u00b7         Yusuf Mehdi, Strategic Partnerships<br \/>\n\u00b7         Steve Berkowitz, Consultative support through organization transition<br \/>\n\u00b7         Vivek Varma, Communications &#038; PR<br \/>\n\u00b7         Tami Reller, Finance<br \/>\n\u00b7         Mary Snapp, Legal &#038; Corporate Affairs<br \/>\n\u00b7         Kristen Roby, Human Resources<\/p>\n<p>You will hear more from the leaders above on details for their respective organizations.

More specifically i&#8217;m<br \/>\nreally impressed and excited by the light weight key pair databases<br \/>\nlike CouchDB. Amazon&#8217;s SimpleDB is interesting from an acceptance of<br \/>\nthe idea perspective, but not very interesting technically. There are<br \/>\nwhole classes of applications which are hard using a relational<br \/>\ndatabase which will be easy to build and scale using key \/ pair style<br \/>\ndb&#8217;s like couchdb and simpledb. What makes delicious, twitter,<br \/>\nfacebook, and flickr hard applications to build on the backend are in<br \/>\nlarge part due to a poor match of database storage engines. With that<br \/>\nfixed, and it seems like we&#8217;re finally getting around to fixing it,<br \/>\nwe&#8217;ll be able to push forward in building social apps which can scale<br \/>\nwhile doing interesting things. Something which hard is going to<br \/>\nbecome easy in 2008.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s see what else? The mobile handset world is going to be<br \/>\ninteresting. Apple will release an SDK which, if they do it the right<br \/>\nway, will create a fountain of new applications. Android will come<br \/>\nalong and let that creativity of building apps spread to more devices,<br \/>\nbut it won&#8217;t be as slick. Apple&#8217;s one device, one screen size, one<br \/>\ninterface, system will be a massive win in terms of building<br \/>\ninteresting applications. The iPhone is the Mac of phones, but it<br \/>\nremains to be seen if Android becomes linux (hackers doing cool stuff<br \/>\nbut not much end user acceptance), Windows widespread but clunky<br \/>\nbecause of the hundreds of devices which need to be supported, or OS2<br \/>\ncool, but simply ignored out of existence.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m excited about computing and the net reaching out in to<br \/>\nnon-computer devices. The Dash Navigator is one example, Chumby and<br \/>\nKindle are others, there are lots. So far they&#8217;ve had a hard time<br \/>\ngetting built and released. Hopefully 2008 will be the year that the<br \/>\nnet stops being about laptops, desktops, and servers. The iphone is a<br \/>\nbit along that path, but there&#8217;s so much more. Perhaps it&#8217;s too<br \/>\noptimistic for 2008, building physical things takes much longer lead<br \/>\ntime. Eventually the device makers will learn what the desktop<br \/>\napplication makers have learned. That having something which is tied<br \/>\nto the net and you can push updates on to will mean you can be much<br \/>\nmore agile.<\/p>\n<p>The last thing i&#8217;m excited about is maps. This isn&#8217;t new, it&#8217;s been<br \/>\ngoing on for a while, but there are neat things happening with maps,<br \/>\ngeo, and location based services. I hope there is enough space for<br \/>\npeople to build something which is social and useful rather than just<br \/>\na marketers dream (find the nearest starbucks).<\/p>\n<p>Those are my hopes for 2008 in terms of technology and the tech industry.<\/p>\n<h2>Honorable Mentions<\/h2>\n<h4>Casey Winans<\/h4>\n<p>In 2008, Google will usurp the traditional telecom companies by<br \/>\nwinning the 700MHz spectrum auction. They will partner with companies<br \/>\nlike Sprint and Clearwire to realize their new national wireless<br \/>\nnetwork. A plethora of new companies will be born that purchase<br \/>\nwholesale access to this new network. Vonage will be relegated to the<br \/>\npages of history as Google&#8217;s Grandcentral ambitions are realized.<br \/>\nMillions of people will flock to their service to obtain one phone<br \/>\nnumber to rule them all. Several phone manufactures will bring<br \/>\nAndroid-based handsets to market that work seamlessly with<br \/>\nGrandcentral. I&#8217;ll be able to use my new mobile device to talk<br \/>\nwhenever I want without fear of going over my minutes or over my<br \/>\nmonthly allotment of data. I&#8217;ll finally be able to use my device to<br \/>\nconnect my laptop anywhere I go and download movies from Amazon Unbox<br \/>\nwithout going bankrupt. My kids will laugh at me and call me a<br \/>\ndinosaur at the mere mention of a voice only network and per minute<br \/>\nusage fees.<\/p>\n<h4>Lou Covey<\/h4>\n<p>What I&#8217;m optimistic about is my 18-year-old son going to college to<br \/>\nstudy &#8220;music technology&#8221; as a major. As much as he loves playing the<br \/>\nguitar he realizes that making a living as a musician is a real crap<br \/>\nshoot, but the technology that exists today and that is coming on<br \/>\nline in the next couple of years makes it possible for him to make a<br \/>\ngood living doing what he loves: making music. The internet and A\/V<br \/>\nrecording capabilities make it possible for a whole new generation of<br \/>\nartists to thrive in society without the control of major<br \/>\nentertainment corporations. Regardless of what we may think of the<br \/>\nsuccess of Radiohead&#8217;s decision to record and release a new album<br \/>\noutside of the the recording industry, it was an earthshaking<br \/>\ndecision. It can be done.<\/p>\n<p>I think the inherent cynicism of the buying public is the best hope<br \/>\nfor the future of technology, and that hope will begin to be realized<br \/>\nin 2008. The general public has become much more tech savvy in the<br \/>\npast decade which is rapidly closing the market canyon between early<br \/>\nand late adopters. That means they can look not only beyond the hype<br \/>\nattached to new tech (and I include social media) and co-opt it for<br \/>\ntheir own needs and purposes. The democratization of technology is<br \/>\nmeans for real optimism.<\/p>\n<h4>Raghu Sankaran<\/h4>\n<p>2008 will be the year where it all comes together. Data will truly be freed<br \/>\nand move online and any authorized app will be able to access my data from<br \/>\nanywhere. All the disparate pieces will unite and google will dominate.<\/p>\n<p>My Google GrandCentral number will be my single point of contact. I will<br \/>\ncheck my GrandCentral messages on my EeePC (that would have hit the $300<br \/>\nprice point) with my morning coffee. I expect a tight integration between<br \/>\nGrandCentral number, my gmail, gchat and SMS.<\/p>\n<p>Then, I work from my home office (connected to a fiber line)\/starbucks and<br \/>\nuse google apps (business) to tie my work\/small business<br \/>\ncommunication\/collaboration. My non-media data and some media data will<br \/>\nreside online on google. I expect a robust backup solution from google that<br \/>\nis similar to TimeMachine<\/p>\n<p>I return home from work to watch HDTV connected one set-top box that is<br \/>\nintegrated with netflix, joost and maybe iTunes itself. I hope to watch<br \/>\nIndian channels online instead of signing a 1 year contract with Dish.<\/p>\n<p>Mac tablet, iPhone SDK, EeePC, Android, Grand Central, Unified solution for<br \/>\nphone number\/email\/contact list\/calendar\/blog\/social<br \/>\nnetworking\/professional networking, HDTV content delivered on demand, one<br \/>\nset-top box to rule them all, LCD backlit cheaper HDTVs, high speed fiber<br \/>\nconnections, 30 inch LCD monitor for $400 and Arrested Development back on<br \/>\nTV&#8230; Of course, I am optimistic about 2008.<\/p>\n<h4>Geoff Daily<\/h4>\n<p>I&#8217;m optimistic more people will be online than ever.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m optimistic that the speeds at which people connect online will be<br \/>\nfaster and cheaper than they are today.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m optimistic in people discovering new ways by which their lives can<br \/>\nbe improved through the use of broadband and broadband applications.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m optimistic that new uses of broadband will continue to spring up<br \/>\nand existing applications will continue to be refined.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m optimistic the Internet will take great strides from being a<br \/>\nnice-to-have to a must-have in improving the quality of our day-to-day<br \/>\nlives.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m optimistic that we will finally begin to have a constructive<br \/>\ndialogue at federal, state, and local levels about the need for more<br \/>\nbroadband, how to get it, how to encourage its use, and how to<br \/>\nregulate it without hindering it.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m optimistic in my belief that 2008 will be the year that the value<br \/>\nof fiber and the big broadband capacity it delivers to the home will<br \/>\nfinally begin to differentiate itself over copper access technologies.<br \/>\nAnd I&#8217;m optimistic that we&#8217;ll have more entities deploying fiber than<br \/>\never.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m optimistic applications developers and hardware manufacturers will<br \/>\nbegin to see the market potential to be found in the millions of<br \/>\npeople not on the cutting edge of technology and, in turn, will begin<br \/>\ndeveloping more ways for non-technical users to interface with and<br \/>\nbenefit from the Internet.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m optimistic about the opportunities that exist when applications<br \/>\ndevelopers, service providers, and network operators work together<br \/>\nrather than fight against each other, and that this will be the year<br \/>\nwe realize what&#8217;s possible through the development and deployment of<br \/>\nin-network applications.<\/p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m optimistic that by this time next year everyone will have a<br \/>\nfuller understanding of the scope that the Internet revolution entails<br \/>\nand in the opportunities broadband presents to re-imagine nearly every<br \/>\nfacet of society as we strive more boldly into the 21st century.<\/p>\n<h4>Adam H. Birnbaum<\/h4>\n<p>I&#8217;m optimistic the term &#8216;social media&#8217; will cease being the focal<br \/>\npoint of business ideas. Social relationships have been around before<br \/>\nhumans existed; A few years before MySpace became popular. It&#8217;s an<br \/>\nexciting time in technology where the analysis of networks are<br \/>\nmeasureable but it&#8217;s completely overboard and showing up everywhere.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s impossible to read an article\/review of a new business<br \/>\nidea\/website without reading about its social features. Social<br \/>\nAdvertising\/Bookmarking\/Shopping\/Networking, Wikis, Blogs, Presence,<br \/>\nVirtual Worlds, Aggregation, Photo\/Video sharing, Live\/Pod Cast, User<br \/>\nGenerated Content and the list continues. Please, make it stop\u2026I feel<br \/>\nlike this can be a web 2.0 version of Billy Joel&#8217;s &#8216;We Didn&#8217;t Start<br \/>\nthe Fire&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m all about seeing these tools used where it makes sense but it&#8217;s<br \/>\ngone berserk. 2007 was another year where companies were trying to<br \/>\n&#8216;be&#8217; Enterprise 2.0 ready and websites were trying to &#8216;be&#8217; Web 2.0<br \/>\nenabled. Being in the middle of it, I really feel that the buzz needs<br \/>\nto fizzle and it can&#8217;t happen fast enough. It&#8217;s spreading to places<br \/>\nthat it doesn&#8217;t belong and I really hope the insanity fades.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to 2008 where business ideas are ideas. Not<br \/>\nsomething that takes an old idea, adds a community slant to it and<br \/>\nre-brands it as new. Communities exist with or without tools to &#8216;make<br \/>\nconnections&#8217;. While I still can&#8217;t order pizza to my house via sms,<br \/>\nI&#8217;m able to have a website decide what kind of pizza I want, send a<br \/>\ntwit so everyone in the world knows what I&#8217;m ordering, get instant<br \/>\nfeedback to see if the toppings are what the &#8216;crowd&#8217; agrees with and<br \/>\nrecord a video of the delivery person at my door. The point is, I&#8217;d<br \/>\nmuch rather have the service than all the social benefits. Granted<br \/>\nthis example is pretty dumb\u2026but as the &#8216;Wisdom of Crowds&#8217; tells us\u2026so<br \/>\nare individuals.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure on January 1, I&#8217;ll read an article that includes something<br \/>\nI&#8217;ve decried above. It&#8217;s certainly wishful thinking that I won&#8217;t have<br \/>\nto deal with this for another year of insanity but I&#8217;m positive there<br \/>\nare others that feel this way. Let&#8217;s unite! It can be a web 2.0<br \/>\nwebsite that has a community to discuss New Year&#8217;s resolutions. Oh<br \/>\nwait\u2026that exists.<\/p>\n<p>I wish everyone a happy socially enabled New Year.<\/p>\n<h4>Derek O.<\/h4>\n<p>I am excited to see how technology companies will integrate the<br \/>\ninternet and my television in 2008. I feel like companies tested the<br \/>\nwaters in 2007 with the Apple TV, Vudu and other expensive lackluster<br \/>\nset-top boxes, as well as internet video services like Hulu, legal<br \/>\nBittorrent, iTunes movies, and other horrible DRM encrusted,<br \/>\nexpensive, or ad-supported content. In 2008 I&#8217;m ready to see some real<br \/>\ninnovation. Until internet services let me rent HD video content<br \/>\nonline at a competitive price, then they can&#8217;t compete with Netflix or<br \/>\nmy local video store. One reason why there has yet to be a good video<br \/>\nservice is bandwidth. But in 2008, homes should start getting much<br \/>\nfaster more robust bandwidth (if Om&#8217;s predictions are right). I&#8217;m<br \/>\ntired of waiting Verizion&#8217;s FIOS to spread to my town. Hopefully it<br \/>\nwill be here in 2008. To me, IPTV seems like it has as much potential<br \/>\nas the internet has. In 2008, I&#8217;m ready to see TV 2.0. This industry<br \/>\nhas yet to have a defining device or service that makes people realize<br \/>\n&#8220;Hey, this is the future of the internet and TV.&#8221; This is what the<br \/>\niPod did for MP3 players. I&#8217;m excited to see if Apple can do the same<br \/>\nthing in 2008 or if it will be another company. I&#8217;m rooting for Apple;<br \/>\nI think that the Apple TV could be revolutionary with a makeover. In<br \/>\n2008 I am optimistic and excited to see traditionally internet content<br \/>\non my TV, and traditionally TV content on my computer.<\/p>\n<blockquote><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Runner-up &#8212; Rabble What i&#8217;m excited about for 2008.

Yes, that sounds counter-intuitive, but personal computing is exactly that: personal. What works best for me and my needs might be utterly useless for you. With that understanding, here&#8217;s my current equipment list. All items were purchased by me out of my own funds unless otherwise noted as evaluation units come and go and are always returned or given to readers in a contest.<\/p>\n<p><strong>As of November, 2007:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Samsung Q1P UMPC<\/strong>. This is the staple of my mobile lifestyle and it accompanies me nearly everywhere I go. I have made some tweaks along the way, such as <a href=\"http:\/\/jkontherun.blogs.com\/jkontherun\/jkontherun-search-results.html?domains=jkOnTheRun&amp;q=q1+vista&amp;sa=Google+Search&amp;sitesearch=jkontherun.blogs.com&amp;client=pub-9199975715765483&amp;forid=1&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;oe=ISO-8859-1&amp;safe=active&amp;flav=0000&amp;sig=06hgV9L5a-lS33ir&amp;cof=GALT%3A%23CC0000%3BGL%3A1%3BDIV%3A%23FFFFFF%3BVLC%3A663399%3BAH%3Acenter%3BBGC%3AFFFFFF%3BLBGC%3AFFCC00%3BALC%3A0000FF%3BLC%3A0000FF%3BT%3A000000%3BGFNT%3A0000FF%3BGIMP%3A0000FF%3BLH%3A50%3BLW%3A390%3BL%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fjkontherun.blogs.com%2Fjkontherun%2Fjk-banner.png%3BS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2F%3BFORID%3A11&amp;hl=en\">installing Vista<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/jkontherun.blogs.com\/jkontherun\/2007\/05\/2gb_of_ram_in_a.html\">upgrading the RAM to the maximum 2-gigabytes<\/a>. Additionally, <a href=\"http:\/\/jkontherun.blogs.com\/jkontherun\/2007\/02\/samsung_q1_6cel.html\">I spent $145 on a 6-cell extended battery<\/a>, which provides 4 to 5 hours of computing time in addition to the 2.5 hours of the standard battery. I don&#8217;t use a screen protector nor a case other than the included Samsung slipcase.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Asus Eee PC 4G, model 701<\/strong> I bought this small sub-notebook as soon as it became available due to it&#8217;s small size, two-pound weight and lack of a hard drive. The LED backlight screen is super-bright and the 4 GB of solid state flash memory is fine for an OS. Getting my <a href=\"http:\/\/jkontherun.blogs.com\/jkontherun\/2007\/11\/3g-wwan-support.html\">3G WWAN card to work with Xandros Linux on the device<\/a> wasn&#8217;t too bad and with a 3.5-hour battery life, it makes for a nice little blogging platform.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stylus.<\/strong> This was provided to me by Microsoft in recognition for my <a href=\"https:\/\/mvp.support.microsoft.com\/profile=E2723C8A-8D1E-4913-8D43-3842851C5D77\">MVP status<\/a>. The heavy stylus is a triple threat: pen, stylus and laser pointer. I use the stylus daily, the pen never and the laser pointer when I want to mess with our two cats. <\/p>\n<p><strong>8 GB Apple iPhone with AT&amp;T SIM<\/strong>. Prior to purchasing the iPhone, I used Windows Mobile devices for about 7 years; many of which were smartphones. Since my UMPC is never far away, <a href=\"http:\/\/jkontherun.blogs.com\/jkontherun\/2007\/05\/has_a_umpc_infl.html\">my need for a smartphone has diminished<\/a> and the iPhone does enough to get by. Like my UMPC, the iPhone is always with me and I find that I&#8217;m browsing the web on it much more than I expected due to the great browsing experience. I don&#8217;t use a case for my iPhone, but I do have it <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shieldzone.com\/\">wrapped in an invisibleSHIELD<\/a>. I&#8217;m currently using the included headset &amp; mic, but will likely upgrade to something with higher sound quality. Due to a family plan, I have the 700 minute iPhone plan with unlimited data and 200 text messages for $79.99 a month.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sierra Wireless 875U AirCard with AT&amp;T SIM<\/strong>. Well, you can&#8217;t be mobile and productive without connectivity and this USB modem suffices for both. The <a href=\"http:\/\/jkontherun.blogs.com\/jkontherun\/2007\/08\/eight-minutes-w.html\">875U is relatively bulky<\/a>, but provides me HSDPA speeds where available and falls back to EDGE in a pinch. I prefer a USB solution for data connectivity as I can use the solution across multiple devices. I have the unlimited data plan at $59.99 a month and might consider the unlimited AT&amp;T hotspot plan for an additional $19.95 monthly.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ThinkOutside Sierra Bluetooth Keyboard<\/strong>. I snagged this for $98 and it&#8217;s worth every cent. The keyboard folds into a small form factor yet unfolds to reveal a full-sized wireless keyboard. It <a href=\"http:\/\/jkontherun.blogs.com\/jkontherun\/2006\/09\/thinkoutside_si.html\">pairs perfectly with my UMPC<\/a> as well as other devices and provides me the option of a great keyboard when needed yet can be tucked away when I want to ink.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Motorola HS820 Bluetooth Headset.<\/strong> I call this &quot;the frog&quot; because of how it looks in the palm of your hand. It&#8217;s well over two years old, but still works flawlessly with Bluetooth phones as well as for Skype conversations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>T-Mobile Dash<\/strong>. I purchased this for under $100 with a new T-Mobile plan, but it&#8217;s now unlocked and used with the AT&amp;T iPhone SIM as needed. This is one of the best Windows Mobile phones I&#8217;ve ever used and it got even better with a <a href=\"http:\/\/jkontherun.blogs.com\/jkontherun\/2007\/05\/tmobile_confirm.html\">free upgrade to Windows Mobile 6<\/a>. If I&#8217;m carrying my iPhone, the Dash stays at home and vice versa. I don&#8217;t feel the need to carry multiple phones.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Gadget Bag.<\/strong> You need something to carry around your gear and I settled on a bag from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.booqbags.com\">Booq<\/a>.

Could this be the dawn of the next Intel? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>By Om Malik<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>March 13, 2002<\/em><\/p>\n<p>At the end of last summer, three entrepreneurs were crammed into a tiny cubicle. Despite the bone-chilling air conditioning, beads of perspiration dotted their foreheads. Just minutes earlier, they had received a special package and unwrapped it with the haste of children on Christmas morning. Their eyes focused on a gray semiconductor lying inside a clear jewel case. They all pondered the same question: would this chip&#8211;one with circuits that control the flow of light, rather than, as other chips do, the flow of electrons&#8211;work?<\/p>\n<p>Over the next few days, Jagdeep Singh, Drew Perkins, and David Welch waited anxiously while other engineers in the company thoroughly tested the chip. Four months earlier the three men had founded Infinera and created a design lab in Cupertino, California. And already they had developed their first chip&#8211;in about half the time of a typical chip-design cycle. If this chip performed as they hoped, it would shatter many of the theoretical limits regarding the behavior of light in optical communications networks.<\/p>\n<p>When the scorecard finally was tallied, the chip performed better than expected. &#8220;High fives all around,&#8221; recalls Mr. Singh, the company&#8217;s president and CEO. &#8220;Dave [Welch] even joked that we hadn&#8217;t set the bar high enough.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Hardly. Infinera&#8217;s thumbnail-size chip is the first integrated photonic circuit. Though Infinera won&#8217;t reveal the chip&#8217;s cost, when built with manufacturing techniques used by chip makers like Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, it likely could be made very cheaply. The savings in manufacturing in turn would lower the cost of network equipment by half, perhaps even more. Beleaguered network carriers like Level 3 Communications and bankrupt Global Crossing could build networks for much less, and run them more efficiently and at a lower cost&#8211;maybe even profitably. For consumers, Infinera&#8217;s chip could be instrumental in allowing communications companies to offer high-speed Internet access at affordable prices. And one day this technological breakthrough could lead to a device capable of projecting a holographic display, as on the TV series Star Trek.<\/p>\n<p>Such an application is far off. Infinera&#8217;s chip first will tackle the vexing problems of optical networking. Today, optical-networking gear&#8211;dense wavelength division multiplexers (DWDM), which split light into its component wavelengths for additional bandwidth; regenerators, which provide light waves with a &#8220;boost&#8221; to travel through hundreds of miles of fiber-optic cable; and add-drop multiplexers, which help ensure no light particles are lost in transmission&#8211;are built from a combination of discrete components like lasers, modulators, amplifiers, transmitters, and electronics. The size of these components varies from as small as a pack of cigarettes to as large as a videocassette. Each component performs a specific task, like converting electrical signals into light particles, splicing light waves into different channels, or altering the frequency of light waves. The components are connected to one another by ultrathin optical fibers. When finally cobbled together, these components comprise a device about the size of an air conditioner.<\/p>\n<p>The integrated photonic circuit developed by Infinera, however, shrinks these discrete components down to microscopic levels and combines them on a slice of indium phosphide (InP)&#8211;instead of silicon. Infinera says its chip can control light waves, or photons, at micron levels&#8211;roughly 1\/50 the width of a human hair&#8211;and can be modified easily to fit into any piece of optical-networking equipment.<\/p>\n<p>Infinera&#8217;s chip will act as the brain of a highly versatile new type of network device that is the size of a pizza box. Just as a microprocessor enables a PC to be used for writing documents, number crunching, or designing greeting cards, Infinera&#8217;s chip has the potential to perform many tasks.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Optical Infusion <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A typical optical network has five basic functions: combining electronic signals from many sources into photon streams, splicing and rejoining light waves into different channels, transmitting light waves, receiving light waves, and converting photonic signals into electronic signals, each going to a different destination. Other than revealing that their device will perform one or more of these functions, Infinera executives are keeping a tight lid on the features being crammed onto the chip.<\/p>\n<p>It is a lot to expect from a single chip, but the company&#8217;s investors are impressed so far. In November, Infinera closed a $50 million second round of funding, bringing its total to $86 million, with investors valuing the company in excess of $250 million. Its corporate and venture capital backers include Applied Materials, Juniper Networks, Accel Partners, Benchmark Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers (which provided a $1 million seed investment), Venrock Associates, and Worldview Technology Partners. Serving on the company&#8217;s board are Pradeep Sindhu, founder, vice chairman, and chief technology officer of Juniper Networks; Dan Maydan, president of Applied Materials; T.J. Rodgers, president and CEO of Cypress Semiconductor; Alex Balkanski, a general partner at Benchmark; and Vinod Khosla, a general partner at Kleiner Perkins.<\/p>\n<p>Infinera is in a race with the nearly 700 startups vying for the top spot in the optical-components space. Any one of them secretly may be developing a similar product. For the time being though, Infinera is in the lead.<\/p>\n<p>To avoid losing the race to a company with the so-called second-mover advantage, Infinera has to figure out a way to mass produce its integrated photonic circuits effectively, then develop a device based on its chip, and finally, write software that makes the device work with existing networks.<\/p>\n<p>As if that were not enough, Infinera also faces the challenge of creating new products for a depressed telecommunications market in which companies like Global Crossing and McLeodUSA are in bankruptcy. Carrier spending on new equipment is down sharply and is expected to stay that way for years to come.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Network Connection <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So far, however, a combination of luck, ambition, and ingenuity have favored Infinera. Two and a half years ago at the annual Kleiner Perkins Christmas party, Mr. Singh and Mr. Perkins met Mr. Welch, who was then an executive vice president at the optical-component maker JDS Uniphase. Mr. Welch had been the chief technology officer of SDL, another Silicon Valley optical-component company, which JDS Uniphase snapped up for $41 billion. Mr. Singh and Mr. Perkins, meanwhile, were toiling at their metropolitan area network (MAN) services startup, OnFiber Communications. In 1999, the duo had sold Lightera Networks, a maker of MAN equipment, to Ciena for $625 million.<\/p>\n<p>Amid cocktails and holiday cheer, the conversation turned to how economically unfeasible optical networks were. The three men found that they shared similar ideas about how to fix the network economics, namely by reducing the cost of network equipment. They made promises to meet soon, and all went their merry ways.<\/p>\n<p>Back at OnFiber, Mr. Singh and Mr. Perkins found themselves growing restless. The itch to start Infinera perhaps struck Mr. Singh first. At 34, he is the youngest son of an Indian diplomat and grew up in India, Sierra Leone, and Jamaica before his family settled in Washington, D.C. OnFiber was Mr. Singh&#8217;s third company (Mr. Singh was one of Red Herring&#8217;s Top Ten Entrepreneurs for 2001).<\/p>\n<p>In contrast, Mr. Perkins, 38, was born in Yonkers, New York, and grew up in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. In 1989, when Mr. Singh was still in college, Mr. Perkins was helping develop the point-to-point protocol, which allows two computers to communicate with each other. This is the cornerstone technology of the Internet&#8211;it allows a PC to connect to servers over a phone line.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Singh and Mr. Perkins, excited by their conversation with Mr. Welch at the holiday party, decided to start a company to build a new device that would make optical networks cheaper. But they soon realized that any hope of building this device hinged upon the development of a new chip&#8211;the integrated photonic circuit.<\/p>\n<p>It was time to call Mr. Welch. Since 1988, Mr. Welch, one of the smartest minds in the world of optical components, has been granted 30 patents in the field of optics. While not exactly bedtime reading, his research papers, read chronologically, chart the history of the development of modern optical components. If Mr. Singh and Mr. Perkins were thinking about the box, Mr. Welch was thinking about its brain. Mr. Welch, however, could not commit to anything until May 2001, when his contract with JDS Uniphase expired. So they waited.<\/p>\n<p>In short order, Mr. Singh and Mr. Perkins hired replacements for themselves at OnFiber, and Mr. Welch prepared to leave JDS Uniphase. On May 1, the trio formed Infinera (which until March operated in stealth mode as Zepton Networks). It became obvious that they would have to do it all simultaneously&#8211;design the chip, determine the best manufacturing technique to mass-produce it, and then build a box to showcase the power of their integrated photonic circuit&#8211;a daunting task. &#8220;In order to build a permanent company, you need to have a big problem to solve,&#8221; admits Mr. Singh.<\/p>\n<p>Aside from tackling the problem of controlling light, Infinera&#8217;s chip also overcomes many of the limitations of silicon-based chips. Indium phosphide is one of what are called III-V compounds. It has photonic properties that allow for the integration of lasers, detectors, dynamic components, passive waveguides, and electronics. Chip makers are thus able to design a photonic circuit and etch it onto an InP wafer in much the same way as with silicon. And like silicon, InP wafers, which are typically three inches in diameter, can hold many microscopic circuits.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A Beautiful Chip<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In December, Infinera began manufacturing test batches of its integrated photonic circuit from an in-house minifoundry. Though Infinera permitted Red Herring to visit its facilities and to speak with its engineers and executives, no one would reveal how many network functions lie within its integrated photonic circuit. We saw one such circuit with our own eyes (through a microscope of course) and thought the complex patterns aesthetically beautiful. Not being chip engineers, we could only play art critic.<\/p>\n<p>Engineers, however, would be intrigued by Infinera&#8217;s ability to overcome what the world of electronics calls the &#8220;tyranny of numbers.&#8221; In the &#8217;50s, complex digital systems were built from discrete electrical components like capacitors, resistors, and transistors. On the tenth anniversary of the birth of the first electronic transistor, J. A. Morton, a chip engineer at Bell Labs, wrote: &#8220;Each element must be made, tested, packed, shipped, unpacked, retested, and interconnected one at a time to produce a whole system. Each element and its connections must operate reliably if the system is to function as a whole . . . the tyranny of large systems sets up a numbers barrier to future advances if we must rely on individual discrete components for producing large systems.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The electronics industry first overcame the tyranny of numbers in 1958, when Jack Kilby, then an engineer at Texas Instruments, came up with the first working prototype of an integrated system built from silicon. Around the same time, Gordon Moore, one of the cofounders of Intel, built a similar circuit. That integrated circuit (IC) became the cornerstone of the electronics revolution. While Mr. Moore&#8217;s breakthrough ultimately led Intel to its Pentium processors, Mr. Kilby&#8217;s approach, dubbed &#8220;the monolithic idea,&#8221; won him a Nobel Prize in Physics in 2000.<\/p>\n<p>Forty-four years later, the optical communications industry is dogged by a similar problem. Optical-networking gear uses components that are manufactured and assembled one at a time, making most equipment very expensive. Components account for as much as 50 percent of the cost of a $100,000-plus long-haul DWDM device and 15 percent of a $40,000 piece of MAN equipment.<\/p>\n<p>The tyranny of numbers has been the undoing of the likes of Corning and JDS Uniphase, two of the largest components manufacturers. Corning, which at one time was worth around $115 a share, now trades at $8 (NYSE: GLW). JDS Uniphase traded for more than $150 a share in early 2000 and now is worth only about $7 (Nasdaq: JDSU). Together, they laid off more than 20,000 people in 2001.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, once-strong demand from equipment makers like Cisco Systems, Ciena, and Nortel Networks has stalled and shows little sign of rebound. It doesn&#8217;t matter how many ways components slice a ray of light or how they transmit data through fiber; if they are too expensive, demand will remain soft.<\/p>\n<p>If components could be integrated, demand for the chips powering them could leap from $14 million in 2000 to $2.6 billion in 2005, according to the Eastern Management Group, a telecommunications consultancy. This growth ultimately depends on the ability of manufacturers to integrate multiple network components, says David Yedwab, an executive vice president at the Eastern Management Group. The resulting cost savings in network construction and maintenance &#8220;could be huge,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>Some of Infinera&#8217;s 700 or so competitors believe that the best way to create such an integrated component is by using planar light wave circuits (PLCs) instead of an integrated photonic circuit. PLCs are formed on glass or silica films. The approach among these companies involves using PLCs alongside conventional electronic chips to reduce network costs.<\/p>\n<p>Genoa, in Fremont, California, is pursuing this method. The company has managed to shrink an optical amplifier, a component typically the size of a videocassette, down to the size of a sugar cube. Normally optical amplifiers cost between $5,000 and $30,000 each, but Genoa&#8217;s technology can reduce those prices by as much as 90 percent. The company&#8217;s ultimate goal, however, is a complete IC&#8211;which Infinera has done.<\/p>\n<p>Other competitors in the race include CyOptics, Opto Speed, and Qusion Technologies. These companies are building components that perform a discrete function, like amplification, on a single chip. Meanwhile, Infinera is building a complete system on a chip. Using the fast-food industry as metaphor, many of these startups are building buns, patties, and pickles, but Infinera is building the Big Mac.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, Infinera&#8217;s ultimate challenge is finding hungry customers among the ailing telecommunications companies. &#8220;There is a huge difference between coming up with an integrated component and getting Verizon to use it,&#8221; warns Mr. Yedwab.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Singh admits he worries about this. &#8220;Look, this represents the first optical integrated circuit,&#8221; he says. &#8220;And we do not underestimate what it takes to go from proof of concept to shipping product. It will be some time before we can perfect the process to produce and package these devices, and it will be more than 12 months&#8211;perhaps in 2003, when we go out of the door.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Waiting until next year gives Infinera time to perfect a manufacturing process. So far no one has been able to produce InP-based circuits efficiently, but the company recently hired Fred Kish as its vice president of manufacturing. Formerly with the fiber-optic group at the equipment maker Agilent Technologies, Mr. Kish holds 28 patents, most related to chip processes. He will work with Mr. Welch on building a foundry.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Absolutely Fab <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our biggest challenge right now is to get our fab up and running; we want to own the process to finish the product,&#8221; says Mr. Singh. In January, the firm relocated to Sunnyvale, California, and a month later it broke ground there on its chip foundry, or fab.<\/p>\n<p>Infinera&#8217;s success depends on whether its bottom-up approach to lowering network costs works. But rather than wait for its inexpensive integrated photonic chip to to be used in devices on optical networks, Infinera is building its own network device based on its chip. Mr. Singh predicts that such a device could cut by half the cost of building, owning, and managing an optical network. If it costs $600 million to build and run a fiber-optic link between New York and San Francisco using current technology, he says, then Infinera&#8217;s technology could cut the costs to $300 million. But is that good enough?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Half is not good enough; you need to do more than that. Anything that cost a buck before will have to cost a dime,&#8221; says Mr. Yedwab.<\/p>\n<p>Infinera is heeding this message. Even though Mr. Singh, Mr. Perkins, and Mr. Welch have developed a chip that might cut network costs in half, they know that isn&#8217;t enough. They continue to look for additional ways to make optical communications even cheaper through applications of their integrated photonic circuit.
