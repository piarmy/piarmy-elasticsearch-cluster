The company cut 1,000+ employees, and considered various options, under pressure from activist investor Elliott Management Group demanded changes. Today, the other shoe has fallen, with remote access software company LogMeIn <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/article\/logmein-merging-with-citrixs-goto-meeting-business\/\">announcing<\/a> that it will acquire the kit-and-kaboodle from Citrix for $1.8 billion.<\/p>\n<p>The deal has been approved by both companies, and will be structured as a &#8216;reverse Morris Trust&#8217; which is a simultaneous spin out and merger, which will lead to a zero tax hit for Citrix.<\/p>\n<p>The combined company should have revenues of over $1 billion.<\/p>\n<p>It seems that the CEO of LogMeIn, Bill Wagner, believes in the synergies between a remote access software company and collaborative communications like the GoTo family, including GoToMeeting, GoToAssist, GoToMyPC, GoToTraining, GoToWebinar, Grasshopper and OpenVoice.

As others &#8212; like Chris O&#8217;Brien &#8212; have <a href=\"http:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2016\/07\/27\/3-troubling-numbers-from-apples-q3-earnings-and-3-hopeful-ones\/\">pointed out<\/a>, Apple has done a great job managing the expectations of Wall Street, and drawing the analysts&#8217; attention to the figures Apple wants us to pay attention to. And the trend in services, and the growing margins in iPad sales, are the figures that are causing the stock to soar.<\/p>\n<p>Tim Cook stated that the services side at Apple is on track to be &#8216;the size of a Fortune 100 company next year&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>So, once again the maturation theme is front and center: Apple&#8217;s sales of new hardware is dropping, but with a huge installed base, what can Apple do to make money? Sell &#8212; or more aptly, rent &#8212; services to all those folks with iPhone, iPads, and Macs. (Oh, and Watches, but that&#8217;s too tiny to matter, and might never.) So if Apple can continue to grow services to the installed base &#8212; plus get some additional boost in iPhone sales in the fall when new models come out &#8212; the company will remain a Wall Street darling.<\/p>\n<p>Relative to enterprise sales, the better margins in iPads has got to be a proxy for increased sales in the enterprise based on the new larger iPad Pro. But, at present, Apple doesn&#8217;t have much of a story for enterprise services.

The company said last week it would accelerate cost cuts after reporting four straight quarters disappointing revenue and profit. Vestberg has faced questions on probes into alleged corruption in Asia and Europe, and last week the company rejected a report in Swedish media that it may be inflating sales by booking revenue before some clients are invoiced.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>As usual, that&#8217;s the proximate cause, but the deep structure is that 4G tech has been rolled out worldwide already, and no one&#8217;s buying much these days.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>With much of the so-called fourth-generation networks already built in the U.S. and China, Vestberg had vowed to improve profitability, but the stock has declined since reaching a more than seven-year high in April last year.<\/p>\n<p>Vestberg had carved out new business units targeting media and enterprise customers to get back to growth, while investing in a next generation of so-called 5G wireless technology, which represents the next wave of spending at Ericsson\u2019s telecom carrier customers. However, he refrained from big, dramatic moves like Nokia\u2019s purchase of Alcatel-Lucent SA, opting instead for a partnership with Cisco Systems Inc. for Internet products like routers.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So, he&#8217;s out for thinking small bore, and we&#8217;re seeing the hiccups from the 4G\/5G transition in Phoneland.<\/p>\n<p>Second story: Steven Russolillo says that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/apple-is-ripe-for-a-rally-1469376231\">Apple is ripe for a Rally<\/a>, despite the fact that market watchers are negative on the giant:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Much of the bearish thesis is due to weakening iPhone sales, which account for more than half of revenue. The iPad isn\u2019t selling as well as it used to and the jury is out on the Apple Watch.<a class=\"icon none\" href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/from-apple-to-facebook-what-tech-investors-want-now-1462117102\"> Tech investors are allergic to anemic growth<\/a>, which explains why the tech-heavy\u00a0<a class=\"company-name\" href=\"http:\/\/quotes.wsj.com\/NDAQ\">Nasdaq<\/a> has lagged behind the Dow industrials and S&amp;P 500.<\/p>\n<p>Still, Apple has been punished more than enough. The iPhone slump\u00a0<a class=\"icon none\" href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/apple-looking-through-the-iphone-gloom-1465577612\">appears priced in<\/a>. And while the next iPhone, expected later this year, <a class=\"icon none\" href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/apple-unlikely-to-make-big-changes-for-next-iphone-1466526489\">likely won\u2019t be a significant upgrade<\/a>, there is optimism that sales growth will soon bounce back. Analysts forecast iPhone unit sales will rise 5% for fiscal 2017, which ends next September.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The real question is not about stock price (or profits, either, with $10.52 billion in the March quarter), but about consumer buying behavior. Will we have to wait for a new mobile device &#8212; like AR\/VR goggles? &#8212; before there is another huge surge in consumer demand for mobile? Watches aren&#8217;t the future, but goggles will be, I bet. Not a 2016 trend, though. Maybe 2017?<\/p>\n<p>The third and last data point for today: Aaron Pressman digs into <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/07\/22\/att-weird-wireless-math\/\">AT&amp;T&#8217;s efforts to convince Wall Street its wireless business is healthy<\/a>. His argument reviews the standard argument that postpaid subscribers &#8212; the ones signed up for monthly accounts &#8212; are generally considered to be better sources of reliable revenue than prepaid subscribers, who generally &#8216;spend less for service, buy cheaper phones, and tend to defect to other carriers more frequently&#8217;.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The bottom line is that so far this year, AT&amp;T\u2019s postpaid subscribers grew only 1% while prepaid subscriptions increased 21%. That\u2019s disturbing to Wall Street, based on the ruling assumption that postpaid customers are preferable.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, Stephens has been trying to push some new math on the analysts. In essence, his argument is that the best customers in prepaid are actually a lot better\u2014and more profitable\u2014than the worst customers in postpaid.<\/p>\n<p>The average service revenue AT&amp;T collected from postpaid customers who have left\u2014and who mostly had not upgraded to smartphones yet\u2014was only $35, he said during a conference call with analysts on Thursday afternoon. But the new prepaid customers signing up with Cricket are bringing in \u201ccloser to a $41, $42\u201d of average revenue. Additionally, it costs less to acquire a new prepaid customer and less to provide them with customer service, he noted.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo from that standpoint, the economics are better, and it is being shown in our margins,\u201d Stephens told analysts, pointing out that while total wireless revenue was down slightly, profit margins were at record highs.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So AT&amp;T has landed in a different dimension, where the economics are reversed, with T-Mobile and others screwing up the numbers for postpaid, while the supposedly poor prepaid sector looks good. However, this may be only true for a short transient period.<\/p>\n<p>And the back office transitions around cable and internet, suggest other churn as the world is turning:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The telco is shedding expensive-to-maintain cable TV customers at its U-Verse unit while adding less costly satellite TV customers for DirecTV. AT&amp;T is dropping broadband Internet customers who connect via older DSL lines while trying to add fiber optic broadband customers. And it\u2019s trying to move corporate customers from traditional managed networks to cheaper virtualized networks. If all of the transitions succeed, both revenue and profits should grow.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Putting all the dots together? The consolidation in Phoneland is accelerating. Old technology is maturing, while new technologies and business models are only slowly emerging, which is leading to the downdraft at Ericsson, and financial analyst disdain for Apple and AT&amp;T. The slowing rate of purchasing &#8212; by telcos and consumers, both &#8212; is leading to consolidation, the classic market maturation that comes right before a new era of breakthroughs and growth. But those breakthroughs won&#8217;t be in 2016.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Connecting the dots on some news stories from Phoneland.

In anticipation of that, I caught up with him to ask a few questions about AI and it&#8217;s potential impact on the business world.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Byron Reese: Do you feel like we are on the path to building an AGI and if so, when do you think we will see it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Rob High:<\/strong> Cognitive technologies, like Watson, apply reasoning techniques to domain-specific problems in things like Healthcare, Finance, Education, and Legal &#8212; anywhere there is an overwhelming amount of information that, if processed, can substantially improve the decisions or outcomes in that domain. For example, the work we&#8217;ve done with Oncologists to help them identify the most appropriate treatments for their cancer patients is based on having assessed what makes the patient unique; standard of care practices and clinical expertise that has been used to train the system; and the available clinical literature that can help doctors make better decisions. This helps to democratize that expertise to a wide swath of other doctors who do not have the benefit of having seen the thousands of patients that major cancer centers like Memorial Sloan Kettering or MD Anderson see. <\/p>\n<p>The types of artificial intelligence used in these systems are spectacular in that they are able draw inferences from literature written in natural language, and to be taught how to interpret the meaning in that language as it applies to bringing the right information at the right time to the doctor&#8217;s fingertips. Unlike Artificial General Intelligence, our goal is to amplify human cognition &#8212; not to do our thinking for us, but to do the necessary research so that we can do our thinking better. <\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you make of all of the angst and concern being talked about in terms of why we should perhaps fear the AGI?<\/strong><br \/>\n<a name=\"q2\" id=\"q2\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The concept of a machine-dominated world is inspired more by Hollywood and science fiction writers rather than technologists and AI researchers. IBM has been firmly committed to responsible science and ethical best practices for over a hundred years \u2013 it\u2019s embedded in our DNA. Our focus is on applying cognitive computing to amplifying human cognitive processes, not on replacing them. <\/p>\n<p>The reality is AI and cognitive technologies will help mankind better understand our world and make more informed decisions. Cognitive computing will always serve to bolster, not replace, human decision-making, working side-by-side with humans to accelerate and improve our ability to act with confidence and authority. The industries where Watson is being applied today \u2013 healthcare, law, financial services, oil &#038; gas \u2013 exist to benefit people working in those industries.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Watson augments a doctor\u2019s abilities by aggregating and producing the best available information to inform medical decisions and democratizing expertise. But it\u2019s the human doctor who takes the information Watson produces and combines it with their own knowledge of a patient and the complex issues associated with each diagnosis. Ultimately, the doctor makes the recommendation, informed by Watson, and the patient makes the decision \u2013 so there will always be a complementary relationship between human and machine.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you think computers can or will become conscious?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Today, we are making significant advances in integrating embodied cognition into robotics through Watson and that remains a primary focus. Our technology currently allows robots to \u2013 like humans \u2013 show expression, understand the nuances of certain interactions and respond appropriately. There\u2019s still a need to teach robots certain skills, like the skill of movement, the skill of seeing, the skill of recognizing the difference between a pot of potatoes that are boiling versus a pot of potatoes that are boiling over.<\/p>\n<p>However, we do believe that we\u2019re only in the first few years of a computing era that will last for decades to come. We are currently assessing what\u2019s doable, what\u2019s useful and what will have economic interest in the future.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Great. We&#8217;ll leave it there.

While most of the current activity is in the finance or fintech sector, there is growing interest in blockchain\u2019s impact on the IoT, healthcare, sharing economy and beyond. Smart contracts, pseudonymous identity management, transparency and cryptographic security are features that have applications well beyond banking. The most obvious use case of distributed, cryptographic ledger data systems in finance is to make more efficient clearing mechanisms for financial transactions. Securities and banking transactions depend on clearninghouses that can authenticate users on each end of a transaction and enable the transfer of funds or completion of the transaction, but this takes up to three days in most cases. Blockchain transactions can automate this type of transaction and cut out the costs of the middlemen who currently handle the bulk of global financial transactions. A great deal of startup activity in the fintech arena is focusing on mobile money and remittances as well as large collaborative intiatives with the largest banks to build private blockchains (or permissioned blockchains) that are closed networks rather than the standard open or public blockchain. With the growth in prevalence of security breaches across the economy, it is no wonder that many other verticals are beginning to pay close attention to developments in blockchain and how it can be used to improve data management, transparency and certifying provenance of goods or that they are not counterfeit, and address the challenges of un-interoperable technology systems. Furthermore, at GigaOm we are looking at new business models that blockchain is going to enable in the coming years.<\/p>\n<p>We are currently taking a close look at healthcare, insurance and the IoT as the next generation of blockchain startups and applications beyond finance. Healthcare is rife with interoperability challenges that stand in the way of coordinating patient care, patient safety and very onerous administrative costs or waste. Companies such as Gem, a blockchain startup, are heavily focused on data management systems using blockchain that can connect diverse datasets across the silos as well as guarantee authenticity of data. The blockchain can be used to create a type of universal record with a timestamp, a library that enables data retrieval across diverse databases. This will become exceedingly valuable as precision medicine and the explosion of sensors, wearables and mHealth apps proceeds. The current health systems and the legacy health IT players quite simply are not well designed to manage the volume and types of data that are being generated today. This stands in the way of realizing the goals of precision medicine in a scalable, pragmatic manner anytime soon. Blockchain and APIs may enable a post-EHR layer of applications to enhance the functionality of current EHRs and make care coordination and population health management much easier to accomplish but this will take several years to become mainstream.<\/p>\n<p>IBM and others major IT vendors are collaborating with the Linux Foundation around the open source Hyperledger Project to accelerate innovation in the blockchain arena. Much of this is driven by growth in the internet of things (IoT) and the need to manage data and services across devices in this ecosystem. Smart contracts can enable micro-payments for services rendered by IoT devices or those monitored by sensors. The security concerns that the IoT raises are also important features of blockchain data management. Alternative versions of blockchain applications such as Tangle are being developed to bring the cloud closer to the devices powering the IoT. New business models are utilizing smart contracts in the context of micro-grids and solar power to enable P2P sharing of energy and payment systems.<\/p>\n<p>More authentic sharing economies may emerge at the nexus of blockchain and insurance. If efficiencies can be realized to authenticate users and incidents, these may enable new forms of insurance for users of AirBnB as one example, but entirely new forms of insurance that involve crowdfunding and matching funding with needs much in the way that Uber and AirBnB do with taxis and apartments. We are also beginning to see microloans of insurance. The authentication and provenance functionalities of blockchain will have robust use cases in mitigating insurance fraud. In healthcare alone Medicare fraud is a major source of lost revenue for the public sector and source of waste.<\/p>\n<p>GigaOm is conducting original research into this rapidly changing space and are looking for companies to work collaboratively on this syndicated report with us that explores the innovative use cases of blockchain.

Many network managers, let alone their superiors and subordinates, are having difficulty wrapping their heads around the inherent complexity of the modern, IoT-enabled, network.<\/p>\n<p>San Diego based SmartDraw Software has heard the cries of the IoT besieged and has built a tool that brings simplicity to the diagramming process. What\u2019s more, the company has introduced SmartDraw Cloud as a companion product (or alternative) to the company\u2019s desktop based SmartDraw 2016 Business Edition.<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, network diagrams, org charts, office layouts, floorplans, decision matrices and flow charts are the fodder of business and excel at serving as a visual representation of conceptual ideas, which go a long way towards getting buy-in on most any project. The importance of bringing simple understanding to complex infrastructures becomes obvious when you realize that some decision makers need to see it to believe it.<\/p>\n<p>SmartDraw\u2019s goal with SmartDraw Cloud is to empower those that must explain. SmartDraw Cloud brings a new paradigm to the diagramming market, something akin to \u201cdiagramming as a service\u201d and, at only $12.95 per month, ithas become a budget friendly alternative to expensive tools such as Microsoft Visio. As a cloud offering, the product brings the full feature set of SmartDraw 2016 Business Edition to more than just the traditional Windows desktop. SmartDraw Cloud runs on OSX, IOS, Android, Linux and pretty much any OS that can launch a modern browser, such as Edge, IE 10+, Safari, Firefox, Chrome or Opera.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hands on with SmartDraw Cloud: <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Beyond the aforementioned IoT and network diagramming capabilities, there are literally thousands of different use cases for SmartDraw. The product offers 70 different categories of drawings, with some 4,500 templates and 34,000 symbols to help users get started. SmartDraw Cloud gives most anyone the ability to draw most anything. That said, the product really shines when it comes to diagramming complex concepts. For those in the world of IT, SmartDraw can become an indispensable companion for building network diagrams, IoT maps, flow charts, and decision trees, \u00a0all of which are used extensively by the majority of tech savvy businesses.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Getting Started:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Diving into SmartDraw first takes making a decision, which basically comes down to choosing what iteration of the product to use. However, there is one caveat, if you purchase the $297 Windows version of SmartDraw 2016 Business edition, you will automatically get a full year of the Cloud service as well. With that in mind, it may make the most sense to start out with the cloud-based offering and then decide if a desktop version is warranted. Either way, SmartDraw does offer a 7-day free trial of the product for those investigating its capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>Using the cloud iteration of SmartDraw proves to be a very simple process, it just takes logging into the cloud app at https:\/\/cloud.smartdraw.com, and the user is presented with the GUI, which is almost indistinguishable from the desktop version of the product. That means users can switch back and forth from the desktop and cloud version with relative ease. All of the menus, icons, templates and other elements are virtually identical between the cloud and desktop iterations of the product.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Creating a Networking \/ IoT Diagram:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The GUI makes creating any diagram amazingly simple. For example, creating a network diagram means navigating down to the Network Design document menu and then choosing the type of network diagram desired (Network or Rack). Fifteen example network diagrams are also offered, giving a neophyte user a head start on building a new network diagram.<\/p>\n<p>For this example, I chose the Enterprise Network template, which then launched another browser window with the diagram editing screen and a sample network design, fully populated with symbols and connections. The design GUI offers a variety of tools, making it easy to change any element on the screen, add effects, create text and so forth. A tabbed interface on the left allows users to choose device images from a \u201cSmartPanel\u201d which supports full drag-and-drop capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>Drag and drop is something not normally found in a browser-based application. Thousands of symbols are available, including all different types of PCs, routers, switches, firewalls, servers and so forth. The GUI also includes a handy tool, which allows a user to search for symbols, allowing normally unrelated symbols to be added to a diagram being created, such as a landscape element like a lamppost or a tree being added to a diagram for IoT networking equipment to indicate where a sensor, IP\/WiFi security camera or other device is located. Just by using the drag and drop capabilities, along with symbols from the libraries, an informative network diagram can be completed in just minutes.<\/p>\n<p>All symbols contained within the diagram can be linked, grouped, have text added to, resized, and even have hyperlinks to other diagrams associated with them. Line drawing proves very easy, where by selecting the line tool, lines can be connected between symbols.<\/p>\n<p>Once the diagram is ready, it can be shared with others by simply clicking the share icon. The diagram can be shared as a view only element (which does not require the recipients to have SmartDraw) and is fully viewable in any browser. If the diagram is shared with a \u201cView and Edit\u201d status, recipients can modify and re-share the diagram. Sharing is accomplished using an emailed link to the diagram.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Creating a Flowchart:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Flowcharts are often the primary fodder behind any type of business process, especially those that involve IT operations. Here, SmartDraw excels in its ability to quickly create flowcharts that have logical progressions and incorporate the Boolean logic that can drive decisions. The product comes prepopulated with flowchart templates, as well as examples that speed design, allowing those creating the charts to focus on critical logic and not the mechanics of graphical design. That said, users can still create attractive, professional-looking flowcharts that are easy to modify and expand as time goes on or processes change.<\/p>\n<p>For example, starting a flowchart based upon the flowcharting template consists of little more than selecting the appropriate visual objects and then adding instructions or text. The product\u2019s \u201cSmartPanel\u201d provides numerous visual examples, along with relevant descriptions, which are easy to select, use and understand. Flowcharts can be built in a matter of minutes and delivered to those looking to achieve the given result. SmartDraw\u2019s real strength here comes in the forms of ease of use and speed, trumping competing products by allowing users to build a flowchart in a matter of minutes, instead of the hours it normally takes using other tools.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Visualizing Data:\u00a0 <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>SmartDraw also includes the ability to quickly create infographics. Here, the product is loaded with templates and charts that can enable a user to build an infographic for most any situation. Population templates, process\/cycle infographic templates, World Data Map templates, and dozens of others are readily available, allowing users to simple plug in collected data and create a professional looking graphical representation of that data.<\/p>\n<p>The product also bundles in several charts, which can be inserted in diagrams. Those charts include the basics, such as bar charts, pie charts and so forth, as well as more advance 3D charts, which give a little more life to the pedestrian data that network managers may be reporting on. Most notable for the IT management realm is the \u201cRelative Value Chart\u201d, which makes it much easier to visualize cost comparisons when calculating critical IT budget elements, such as ROI and TCO. Timeline, Spheres, and Venn infographics are well represented by the GUI, making it a simple chore of selecting what graphic a user needs to use and then just populating the data.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Engineering and CAD: <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While SmartDraw makes no boisterous claims that the product can replace multi-thousand-dollar design packages, such as AutoCAD, MATLAB and others, the product sure goes a long way towards covering the basics by providing several engineering templates that can be used to create electrical wiring diagrams, industrial automation designs, and even architectural blueprints. Users can quickly layout floor plans, office buildings, circuit panels and several other CAD\/CAM type diagrams with relative ease. The included tools and wizards take a lot of the guesswork out of what are normally complex designs and can expand IT\u2019s ability to be part of the design process. What\u2019s more, a short learning curve and ample integrated help makes what may seem at first impossible, an achievable goal for individuals without any prior CAD\/CAM experience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But Wait, There\u2019s More:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At the risk of sounding like a late night infomercial, there is much more to SmartDraw than the above examples. The product includes templates and examples to build cause &amp; effect diagrams, decision trees, emergency &amp; disaster planning diagrams, flyers &amp; certificates, forms, project management charts, mind maps, org charts, process documentation, schedules, strategic plans and much more.<\/p>\n<p>However, the products core strength lies with more than just countless charts, templates and graphical design tools. The real strength comes from the ease of use associated with created those complicated visual representations. A chore that was once only in the realm of professional graphic artists, that could take days or even weeks to deliver attractive visual representations of complex data sets.<\/p>\n<p>One would be remiss if they did not mention SmartDraw\u2019s primary competitor, Visio. SmartDraw offers several advantages over Visio, starting with the availability of SmartDraw Cloud and ending with ease of use. In between those two comparative bookends lies features such as the ability to share diagrams with others (who lack any type of diagramming package) and the automation that SmartDraw offers in the form of intelligently connected objects. For those comparison shopping, SmartDraw offers the Visio Filter, which imports native Visio drawings into SmartDraw, without losing any content, making it easy to play around with SmartDraw\u2019s feature set, without having to recreate Visio drawings from scratch.<\/p>\n<p>Once you add the cloud-based version of SmartDraw to the mix, you wind up with a real winner, at least when it comes to visualizing most anything you can imagine.

For the uninitiated, <a href=\"http:\/\/sloanreview.mit.edu\/article\/the-nine-elements-of-digital-transformation\/\">MITSloan<\/a> defines digital transformation is all about the use of technology to radically improve the performance or reach of enterprises. While that definition may fit into a catch all of what information technology is all about, there is a lot more to digital transformation than meets the eye.<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, the pathway to digital transformation is beset by all sorts of challenges, something that is aptly spelled out in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.altimetergroup.com\/2014\/07\/the-2014-state-of-digital-transformation\/\" target=\"_blank\">Altimeter\u2019s State of Digital Transformation report<\/a>, which points out major challenges consisting of changing the company culture, fostering cooperation between departments, and securing the appropriate resources to succeed. While those elements in themselves are considerable challenges, numerous fortune 5000s have successfully achieved the nirvana of digital transformation, but at great cost.<\/p>\n<p>While much of that cost can be attributed to business realignment, training and organizational structure changes, the simple fact of the matter is that digital transformation all comes down to having the proper infrastructure in place and the tools to leverage, manage and optimize that infrastructure. What\u2019s more, the actually technological process behind digital transformation can be both helped and hampered by the distributed nature of today\u2019s networks, meaning that public, private, and hybrid cloud technologies can bring both benefits and complications to digital transformation.<br \/>\nSome business, such as AirBnB and Uber, brought digital transformed their business models by eschewing privately owned infrastructure and fully leveraging the ideology of hosted infrastructure, such as the PaaS (Platforms as a Service) model.<\/p>\n<p>That said, other businesses are still very much leveraging in house solutions to achieve digital transformation, take for instance Caterpillar, which is developing ways to sell data, and not just \u201cthings\u201d. \u00a0Regardless of the basic infrastructure in use, one of the goals of digital transformation is to bring \u201cdata and things\u201d together, to build an intelligent internet of things (IoT), and that means bringing full visibility to IoT, as well as data. A concept that Joshua Dobies, VP Product Marketing at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.riverbed.com\" target=\"_blank\">Riverbed<\/a>, has much to say about.<\/p>\n<p>In an interview with GigaOM, Dobies said \u201cthe world of digital transformation powered by optimization.\u201d A fact well illustrated by all of the moving parts involved with tying various micro-services, cloud resources, and application foundations together. Dobies added \u201covercoming latency and the physical distances is one of the biggest challenges facing those interested in digital transformation.\u201d Dobies makes a good point, if the various pieces of an application are logically distant, application performance will suffer appreciably, perhaps destroying the end user experience and effectively putting a nail in the digital transformation coffin.<\/p>\n<p>Dobies also said \u201cMany businesses have failed to achieve their goals of digital transformation, simply because they did not properly address infrastructure issues before hand.\u201d Dobies\u2019 comments lead to an unmistakable conclusion \u2013 digital transformation should never be an organic process, it is something that takes proper planning and creating a foundation (read infrastructure) that can successfully integrate all of the moving pieces into a cohesive, manageable solution.<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, digital transformation take tenacity, persistence, planning, and the appropriate technology to be successful.

Prior to Nanoco, Michael held a number of executive roles including responsibility for licensing the technology developed by GE\/Bayer joint venture, Exatec LLP, Vice President and Managing Director at yet2.com , Commercial Director at Colloids Ltd and Business Manager at Brunner Mond &#038; Co ltd., Michael started his career with ICI, has a Ph.D. in organo\u2013metallic chemistry from the University of Sussex, UK, and undergraduate degree in classics and chemistry from Tufts University, Boston, MA, USA.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Michael Edelman will be speaking at <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/change\/\">Gigaom Change Leaders Summit<\/a><\/strong> in Austin, September 21-23rd. In anticipation of that, I caught up with him to ask a few questions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Byron Reese: Tell me the first time you ever heard about Nanotechnology?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Michael Edelman<\/strong>: Oh gosh, probably in the late eighties. And in the late eighties, we weren&#8217;t really calling it nanotechnology then, we were calling it colloidal chemistry, which is chemistry on a very small scale and then the nano name took off. Nanotechnology has been around for thousands of years, starting off with some of the early pigments and dyes used by Greeks and Romans to paint pots. So it&#8217;s not a new concept, chemists, physicists have been working on these sorts of technologies for a very very long time, and typically what we mean by nanotechnology is materials, things under 75 to 100 nanometers. You are looking at working with sizes 10,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair. So pretty small.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Wow us a little bit with some of the science fictiony things we may live to see that nano is going to enable.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>With Nanoco, my company, we play in the area of florescent semi-conductors called quantum dots. What\u2019s unique about these materials and nanomaterials in general, is that they start to behave in weird and wonderful ways when they get very small. <\/p>\n<p>And the amazing thing that our materials do is they fluoresce, they give off very, very bright, different colored light; red, green, blue, orange, yellow, whatever color you want. And that color is strictly dependent on the size of the nanocrystal. We are manufacturing these nanocrystals with a diameter between one and ten nanometers which is ten to one hundred atoms across. <\/p>\n<p>We accurately manufacture these materials, growing these crystals of one, two, three, five, seven nanometers. It would be as if you had a very tiny golf ball with a diameter of one nanometer, and you expanded it. The chemical makeup is the same, but the mass is changing and this changes the electronic properties, which in turn changes the optical properties or color of light emitted. <\/p>\n<p>When you have a material that lights up very brightly with only tiny amounts of energy, people start getting excited. We can bind specific anti-bodies to the quantum dots and use them to more accurately image and diagnose cancer. They absorb energy so they can also be used very effectively as new generations of solar cells. <\/p>\n<p>So the \u2018wow factor\u2019 for the materials, these quantum dots, is that it\u2019s a true platform technology that can be used across a number of different and unrelated end use applications from cancer imaging to next generation displays. <\/p>\n<p>I get excited because it is very infrequent that you see a true platform technology. It is a word that is overused today. People talk about platform technologies all the time, but when you see a material that actually can be used in a number of unrelated sectors its tremendous.<\/p>\n<p>Dr Nigel Pickett, our CTO and co-founder and I started Nanoco in the UK, in a converted men\u2019s bathroom at the University of Manchester and have grown very successfully since then.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So you&#8217;ve actually expanded into the woman&#8217;s bathroom at this point?<\/strong><\/p>\n[laughing] We\u2019re actually much bigger. HP started in a garage and we started in the toilet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Well you&#8217;ve got no place to go but up from there.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well it was a big toilet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In what sense are quantum dots quantum?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Because you get what we call a \u2018sized quantization effect\u2019 which is where the electronic properties of the semiconductor materials are changed, meaning the band gap of the material can be altered by changing the size. That is the quantum effect. <\/p>\n<p><strong>And how will they be used in quantum computing?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Our main focus today for these materials is on things that require enhanced color, so as a company we are not working on quantum computing.  The folks working on quantum computing, using more traditional semiconductor technology, use molecular beam epitaxy to grow these quantum dots on wafers. That is the area that\u2019s focused on the quantum computing. <\/p>\n<p>We are essentially chemists and we are making these quantum dots in chemical reactors. In essence we are high-tech cooks, we add ingredients, we stir those ingredients and we heat them. How we do it is fairly sophisticated but the advantage of this is that the finished product is very cost effective to make, so we can apply these onto TVs today. Those TVs are at a price point that you and I can buy. Whereas quantum computing today is not there yet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So where are you from a commercial standpoint with your technology?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The technology right now is getting launched into the marketplace. The Company has signed a number of deals, and probably [the one] that we\u2019re known for is with Dow Chemical. Dow has built a large facility in South Korea to service the display industry, mainly the Korean TV giants. And the first products coming online are products from Samsung. You can go to Best Buy today and buy a new Samsung TV with enhanced color that comes from quantum dot technology. The first market to take off is the display market, and in the display market the first products are the high end color enhanced 4K displays. We are talking about LCD TV&#8217;s and LCD is the predominant display technology out there with about 240 million LCD TVs being sold each year. We\u2019re helping the LCD technology, which has been around for a number of years, evolve and continue to get better.<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, for lighting systems we have developed some products that we launched earlier in the year into horticultural lighting. What we\u2019re doing is tuning the LED light with the quantum dots, so the light emits specific wavelengths that promote specific plant growth. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Looking forward in the next two or three years, what are some breakthroughs our readers should just keep an eye out for in the news?<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p>The televisions are here now, they are getting rolled out and you are going to see a lot more of them. [Also] light and different types of light sources using quantum dots are here and you are going to see more quantum dot based lighting. <\/p>\n<p>What I am excited about, if I look three to five years down the road, is the use of these materials in biological imaging and life science applications. Because our materials are all heavy metal free, [they can be used in the body] to very accurately image and diagnose cancer at an early stage, at a very sensitive level.  You can tag specific anti-bodies onto these quantum dots of whatever color, and manipulate the size so they can get through the cell walls. Then they can bind specifically to a cancer that you are targeting. This, to me, is amazing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Thank you so much for your time. I look forward to discussing this further in September.<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p>Michael Edelman will be speaking on the subject of nanotechnology at <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/change\/\">Gigaom Change Leaders Summit<\/a><\/strong> in Austin, September 21-23rd. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dr. Michael Edelman joined Nanoco in 2004, led the initial fund\u2013raising and spun Nanoco out of the University of Manchester.

It is excerpted from <\/i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1119190754\/\"><span class=\"s2\"><i>Not Everyone Gets a Trophy: How to Manage the Millennials<\/i><\/span><\/a> by <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/contributor\/bruce-tulgan\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Bruce Tulgan<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Set Clear Ground Rules Up Front<\/h3>\n<p>Managers tell me every day that Millennials fail to meet a lot of unspoken expectations about behavior in the workplace. I have an idea: Speak them! <\/p>\n<p>One credit union manager was telling me about a young employee who routinely came to work late and then made lots of personal calls on his cell phone throughout the workday. \u201cDo I really need to tell him, \u2018Come to work on time, and it\u2019s not good to make so many personal calls all day long\u2019?\u201d Yes! You have to tell him, up front and every step of the way.<\/p>\n<p>You have to figure out what your expectations are and then speak up. Set ground rules. Maybe there are corporate policies in place already. But often there are no concrete policies to regulate important intangibles like attitude, tone of voice, and other subtleties of professionalism in the workplace. You may need to figure out these ground rules on your own. You may need to say, \u201cWhenever you are working with me, on any task, for any period of time, these are MY ground rules.\u201d Then lay out your ground rules in no uncertain terms, and make it clear they are deal breakers for you: you can\u2019t work with someone who doesn\u2019t follow these ground rules.<\/p>\n<h3>Leverage the Power of High-Structure, One-on-One Meetings<\/h3>\n<p>Remember that Millennials have grown up hyper-scheduled. They thrive on that kind of structure, and they thrive on one-on-one attention. One of the most effective ways to help your young employees learn to be managed by you is to schedule regular discussions with each of them about their work.<br \/>\nAt first, err on the side of meeting more often with each person\u2014every day, every other day, or once a week. Start by evaluating what time will best work for you: What time will fit your regular schedule and needs? Then communicate with each Millennial the expectation that you will meet regularly one-on-one at a regular time.<\/p>\n<p>Making a plan with your young employee to meet one-on-one at a regular time and place is a huge commitment for both of you. It is a powerful statement that you care enough to spend time setting this person up for success. When you follow through and spend that time, you are creating a constant feedback loop for ongoing short-term goal setting, performance evaluation, coaching, troubleshooting, and regular course correction.<\/p>\n<p>Spell out how long you expect each meeting to last (my advice is to keep them to fifteen or twenty minutes). Don\u2019t ever let these meetings become long or convoluted. Make it clear that your meetings will follow a fast and tidy agenda, preferably the same basic format every time. Start each meeting by reviewing the agenda. Whenever possible, present an agenda in writing that you can both follow. These meetings should be cordial but all business. This is not the time for chitchat.<\/p>\n<p>Like everything else, this dynamic process will change over time, and your approach will have to change with each young employee you meet with regularly. For each of your employees, you\u2019ll have to figure out how often to meet, how much time to spend at each meeting, what format to use, and what topics to cover. And remember: you\u2019ll have to make adjustments over time. <\/p>\n<p>No matter how well things seem to be going, you still need to verify that things are indeed going as well as you think. If they are, make sure that Millennial knows just how many points she is scoring today.<\/p>\n<h3>Create an Upward Spiral of Continuous Improvement<\/h3>\n<p>Managers often tell me they have a hard time talking to Millennials about failures great and small. \u201cWhen they make a mistake, you hesitate to tell them because they take it so hard,\u201d I was told by a partner at a prestigious law firm. \u201cThey seem to take it personally, like you are breaking their heart. I want to say, \u2018Don\u2019t feel bad. Just go back and make these changes, and then next time try to remember to do it properly in the first place.\u2019 That seems pretty basic.\u201d It is pretty basic.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to addressing Millennials\u2019 performance problems, the most common mistake managers make is soft-pedaling honest feedback or withholding it altogether. Sometimes managers take back incomplete work and finish it themselves or reassign it. Other times the problems are not addressed at all, and the work product remains substandard. Millennials are left to fail unwittingly or improve on their own impulse and initiative. As one Millennial put it, \u201cWhat do you want me to do, scream it? Beg for it? Help! Help me get it right. Help me do it faster. Help me do it better. Help me improve.\u201d<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>About the Author<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Bruce Tulgan is an adviser to business leaders all over the world and a sought-after keynote speaker and seminar leader.

Ideally, visual drag and drop tools for should be provided for less technical team members, while the ability to code, should be provided for advanced members. What\u2019s more, monitoring, security options and role based administration tools should be made available to those responsible of deployments.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, previous attempts to achieve the goal of agile decision making has been an almost impossible task, thanks to the silos surrounding data science development and the deployment of operational applications that can illustrate results.<\/p>\n<p>Douetteau says \u201cthe biggest challenge of most data science projects is getting everyone on the same page in terms of business goals, technical requirements, project challenges, and responsibilities. More often than not, there is a disconnect between the worlds of development and production. Some teams may choose to re-code everything in an entirely different language while others may make changes to core elements, such as testing procedures, backup plans, and programming languages.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It is that isolationism that prevents many data science projects from becoming an overall success, and worse yet, lead to incorrect conclusions and assumptions. Much of the blame can be placed upon the waterfall development ideologies of the past, which have hampered the adoption of agility in the area of data sciences.<\/p>\n<p>Douetteau adds \u201cpreventing failures takes a manager who is willing to act as tech stack and programming language dictator, who will force the team into a fixed technology for a solution. That manager should also ensure that team members adopt a big picture approach, where they are able to help each other complete tasks outside of their comfort zone. Individual silos of knowledge will hinder a team\u2019s effectiveness, and collaboration is the key to success.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For enterprises to truly become agile, they must eschew those waterfall development processes and switch to agile methods across the board. However, data science projects seem to be the most opportune place to start in today\u2019s on demand, instant results world.<\/p>\n<p>Douetteau adds \u201cProviding a platform that caters to all members of the team promotes collaboration and communication, two elements that are essential to the success of any devops\/data analysis project that involve multiple departments.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, the lessons learned on data science projects can be readily applied to other areas of IT and business operations, making agile an achievable goal, as long as you know where to start.<\/p>\n<p>Douetteau says \u201cFinding a common ground between your data team and IT department will undoubtedly ease the process of creating a data product for your organization.\u00a0 If all of your teams are aligned from the start of a project, each department knows their role and what technologies they are familiar with and specialize in to accomplish the task. Data scientists can build a solution and the IT department can deploy it.\u00a0\u00a0 Once a best practices procedure is established it can be reproduced and your organization can more quickly and effectively make use of new predictive data opportunities\u2026 making your organization truly agile\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; Agility has become the buzz word around the enterprise. whether it is agility around storage, networking, cloud operations, or most any&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8020068,"featured_media":950361,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[11287,28070474,359216332],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950360"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8020068"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=950360"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950360\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/950361"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=950360"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=950360"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=950360"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":950355,"date":"2016-07-11T09:39:46","date_gmt":"2016-07-11T14:39:46","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=950355"},"modified":"2017-04-04T12:31:46","modified_gmt":"2017-04-04T17:31:46","slug":"manoj-saxena-talks-artificial-intelligence-with-gigaom","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/07\/11\/manoj-saxena-talks-artificial-intelligence-with-gigaom\/","title":{"rendered":"Manoj Saxena talks Artificial Intelligence with Gigaom"},"content":{"rendered":"<img src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/themes\/go-ossein\/library\/images\/gigaom-change\/speaker-manoj-saxena.jpg\" alt=\"Manoj Saxena\" width=\"300\" height=\"285\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-949653\" \/>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/ai\/#speakers\">Manoj Saxena<\/a><\/strong> is the executive chairman of CognitiveScale and a founding managing director of The Entrepreneurs&#8217; Fund IV (TEF), a $100m seed fund focused exclusively on the cognitive computing space.<\/p>\n<p>Saxena is also the chairman of Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, San Antonio branch and Chairman, SparkCognition an Austin based cognitive security and safety analytics company. <\/p>\n<p>Prior to joining TEF, Saxena was general manager, IBM Watson, where his team built the world&#8217;s first cognitive systems in healthcare, financial services, and retail. Earlier he founded, built and sold two Austin based software startups. <\/p>\n<p>Saxena will be speaking at <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/ai\/\">Gigaom AI<\/a><\/strong> in San Francisco, February 15-16th. In anticipation of that, I caught up with him to ask a few questions about AI and it&#8217;s potential impact on the business world.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Byron Reese: How intelligent do you think a computer can become?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Manoj Saxena:<\/strong> I think they can become super intelligent. They already are. In certain areas, they have far exceeded human brain capacity. Now they are super intelligent, they are not super conscious. So I separate intelligence from awareness and consciousness. So I think intelligence is here, has been here for decades. And you know with the advent of cheaper computing power in the cloud and more access to cloud through mobile, I think that intelligence is going to get more and more pervasive and will basically be woven into all aspects of our life. You know, how we work, how we live and how we play is all going to be changed through computer intelligence surrounding us. I actually talked about this notion of as a species Homo Sapiens are dead. Home Digitalis is the future because we will be surrounded by intelligence and amplified and augmented by intelligence.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you believe that in AGI, general intelligence is possible to build?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think it is possible but we are probably at least 40 or 50 years away from it. You know artificial general intelligence which essentially you could argue that you know parts of it. Google, you could argue as the beginning of an AGI kind of like a mega brain or Watson in certain domain is the beginning of an AGI but through AGI covering all forms of human knowledge and human pursuits, I&#8217;ve read a study on it that even if you ask the specialist in the AI field, the average response was that we are looking at 2050 or 2060 by the time we will attain AGI. I think the most exciting part is not AGI but ASI, Artificial Specific Intelligence.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How so?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well I think a little bit of AI can go a long way. There were few big revelations when I was running IBM Watson. First, you don&#8217;t need to build an AGI to drive humanity forward or to transform businesses. A little bit of AI when applied to targeted consumer engagement or industry specific business processes can have exponentially huge impact. The second insight I had when I was running Watson is, the real interesting part about AI and machine intelligence is not asking the question of a machine, but it&#8217;s the machine telling you what question to ask. You know there is three types of information in this world: there is stuff you know, there is stuff you know you don&#8217;t know, and there is stuff you don&#8217;t know that you don&#8217;t know. The real interesting part of machine intelligence is the third bucket where the machine taps you on the shoulder and says, hey you got to check this out.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I don&#8217;t want to get bogged down in definitions or anything, but can you please explain the distinction between machine intelligence, artificial intelligence and cognitive computing?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yeah. So artificial intelligence is sort of the uber category. Artificial intelligence is like saying &#8216;software&#8217;. It&#8217;s the broadest definition which includes multiple types of technologies and techniques: machine learning is one, computer vision is another one, and cognitive computing is yet another one. There are many other types of AI. So at a top level, AI is the super category and then within that, machine intelligence is application of AI where machines start learning and start getting smarter on their own. So it could be a thermostat, it could be a traffic light or it could be a mobile app. Any of these can get smarter.  Cognitive computing is that specific part of AI that relates to mimicking the human brain in terms of how we understand, reason, decide, and learn as a human being. <\/p>\n<p><strong>And recently, you know Stephen Hawking has mentioned that AGI may be an existential threat. Elon Musk says things like, maybe we are just a boot loader for the machine intelligence and that&#8217;s the next step in evolution. Bill Gates is concerned about what a general intelligence could do. I would ask two questions. One, why do you think that so many obviously very smart people are worried about it and second, do you share that worry?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think there is some truth to that worry that I share. But I also think there are other scenarios that are in my opinion overhyped and overinflated in terms of machines as the new digital overlords.<\/p>\n[CALL IS LOST. AFTER RECONNECTING:]\n<p>My car&#8217;s system is kind of acting up here. This is a good example of why I am not too worried about machines being our own overlords because you can&#8217;t even get the damn phone to work in your car or your autocorrect to work on your cell phone as someone said. Having said that, today we already are at a point where machines are running our lives. There are millions of us that entrust our lives to computers today by allowing a computer to land our plane and seem very comfortable doing so. And that will slowly expand that we could only get more prevalent as we start giving more and more trust to machines. Robotic surgeries of eyes or blood vessels are other good examples.  <\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, there is a lot that we don&#8217;t know about how the human brain works and it will be hard to replicate that in a machine. There is much to be learned around our own consciousness, compassion and instincts work for example so in that sense we are very far away from the worry of a new digital race of computers.<\/p>\n<p>What is needed for sure are some general principles and governance by which we as a race put this powerful technology to work for the betterment of society. I am currently engaged in some discussions with industry and local leaders around AI ethics and moral responsibilities to prevent both real and perceived threats from an AI apocalypse.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So what are you trying to do with CognitiveScale?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>What we focus CognitiveScale on is deep practical applications of machine learning in industry. So what CognitiveScale builds is the notion of industry digital brains. They have taken AI and applied it into three verticals in commerce, in healthcare and in wealth management. We call it health, wealth and commerce. We are using AI to transform how patients manage chronic conditions and chronic diseases. We are using AI to manage how shoppers are experiencing their journey with the retailer and how financial advisors and investment advice is being delivered to end users. So we focus on transforming the experience of a user through a mobile phone or a browser that creates an experience like that of the traffic and map application Waze. <\/p>\n<p>Waze is a good example of an existing cognitive app. You know it&#8217;s an app that is able to source a lot of data both structured data and unstructured data and it&#8217;s an app that guides you through the journey and optimizes your experience and outcomes. It knows you, it knows what&#8217;s around you and it gets you to your destination in the most efficient fashion. So what CognitiveScale is doing is they are building products for health, wealth and commerce that create a Waze-like experience that lets a patient manage their diabetes or their cancer or their obesity by guiding them through their journey. It lets a shopper manage the journey of shopping for an event and it helps a financial client manage the journey of investment advice because we believe that patient shoppers and financial clients, they all go through a journey and these applications take a regular mobile app and they put a little digital brain behind it and those applications start acting like Waze.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And where are you in your product lifecycle?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>CognitiveScale has launched two products. One is called Engage for the customers, the other is called Amplify for business processes. So Engage transforms how a customer experiences the company and Amplify makes every employee your smartest employee. They are about a 100 people and they have been in existence for about 3 years. They have 20 customers and global brands you know everything from Barclays to Nestle to Macy&#8217;s to Dow, Eli Lilly, MD Anderson. So they\u2019ve got a tremendous technology and client proof points and have a very strong deal pipeline. Off to a good start but much more needs to be done.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you believe that computers will become conscious?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well yes and no. So, yes but it depends on how you define consciousness. So with consciousness, there are two problems. One is, there is no consciousness detector today. So we don&#8217;t really have a model that says, okay what&#8217;s the level of consciousness in a particular human being. Now there are some models that are based on anatomy like doctors use to know if you are comatose or not or behavioral people use to figure out whether you are mentally capable or not but there is no proper sort of a continuous consciousness detector that we can use to measure a person&#8217;s or a computer&#8217;s consciousness or lack of it. So one is a problem of measurement. <\/p>\n<p>And second is a problem of applicability because only, I think, 5% of the human brain is used around consciousness or consciousness-related activities and it may very well be that consciousness may be outmoded and may be outdated by computers that get super intelligent and are able to do tasks much more efficiently and maybe the relevance of what consciousness is needed for is a lot more limiting.<\/p>\n<p>For example, how does it matter for a computer or when does it matter if the computer can sense the pain of a young wife who lost her husband, or if the computer can sense the joy and laughter of a child on a beach, or why someone would throw themselves in front of a running train to save a baby, right? So these are the kinds of things while they are important, they may not be as relevant in the grander scheme of things for the progress of humanity with machine intelligence. So those are the two issues. Therefore, in part yes, you could say the computers will get self-aware but I think unless we have a proper consciousness detector, it will be very hard to formally answer the questions if computers can become conscious.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is your take on the Chinese room problem, which argues that computers can&#8217;t really ever be truly intelligent? [Note, this is a classic argument against the possibility of a general AI put forth by the philosopher John Searle. It is worth looking up in Wikipedia. But the basic idea is that because a computer is completely mechanistic, it simply follows programming. No matter how clever it looks, it doesn\u2019t really understand anything.]<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think there is a lot of truth to that statement as long as you assume that computers are being built on the Von Neumann architecture. Under the present architecture the Chinese room problem that you are talking about is true. You can say the computer is only parsing things together. However, if you look at evolution of quantum computers, [it might be different.]  When you ask a current computer what is 1 plus 1, it will get you 2. When you ask a quantum computer what is 1 plus 1, it will take all numbers on the right and all numbers on the left and it will give you all kinds of answers. So it won\u2019t just add up 1 plus 1, it will add up 1 plus 5, five million plus 3 and on both sides and then it picks a particular quantum event. So a lot of theories [suggest] that the human mind is a quantum machine, and that the reason we make connections across things which may not have any logic to it. There is a big stream of expertise and thinking that believes that the human mind operates not like a traditional computer but more like a quantum computer. So if you took that approach then I think the answer could be, &#8216;yes AGI is possible.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Great. We&#8217;ll leave it there.

Healthcare\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2016\/04\/21\/with-new-developments-in-healthcare-it-security-must-evolve\/\">interoperability challenge<\/a> may only grow worse for the medium term as the growth of data from beyond the electronic health records (EHRs) due to wearables, smartphone apps and sensors in the home become more mainstream.<\/p>\n<p>We see a number of bottlenecks arising out of this inability to integrate non-EHR data into records and become actionable intelligence for clinicians. This partially accounts for the lack of stickiness of most wearables as the data collected is locked in apps and fails to provide actionable feedback to those whom need it most.<\/p>\n<p>A great deal of health data is locked in silos and under-utilized in both the diagnostic process and more broadly in medical research. Blockchain is one of several solutions that are only going to grow in importance, due to its distributed and traceable nature.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, healthcare is reaching an epic number of data security breaches over the past year including entire hospitals taken hostage by <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2016\/06\/23\/healthcare-security-today-ransomware-attacks-increasingly-common\/\">ransomware<\/a>. With blockchain we may get a twofer by giving patients more control over whom they can share data with in clinical research, for example, while also maintaining higher levels of security.<\/p>\n<p>Blockchain\u2019s smart contract capabilities might also enable sharing economies for medical technology such as MRIs, expensive machinery that sometimes goes idle and could take advantage of the IoT and blockchain and enable new business models around scheduling and local options for consumers.<\/p>\n<p>Blockchain has also recently been used to help fund novel HIV research. UBS, the bank, donated code to Finclusion Systems for a platform that will launch HealBond, a \u201csmart bond\u201d amounting to $10B deployed in a more efficient manner to fund research for HIV cures.<\/p>\n<p>As healthcare slowly enters the API economy beyond siloed EHRs we may eventually see the post-EHR based on distributed databases and more patient-centric controls. Blockchain will likely play a major supporting role in this gradual transition that values data liquidity vs. data capture, patient-centric vs. vendor-centric solutions that we find in our current health IT ecosystem.<\/p>\n<p>This will be good news for consumers and those interested in wellness, but this won\u2019t happen overnight. We may also need to approach blockchain with the openness that typically hasn\u2019t greeted \u201cthe new\u201d in technology in the past. Play and experimentation will be needed to change entrenched ways.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By now most readers have probably heard of blockchain through tech blogs and major cover stories from the likes of The Economist&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5616894,"featured_media":950349,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[359256495,359217384],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950348"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5616894"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=950348"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950348\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/950349"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=950348"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=950348"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=950348"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":950343,"date":"2016-07-06T10:38:52","date_gmt":"2016-07-06T17:38:52","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=950343"},"modified":"2016-07-06T21:53:04","modified_gmt":"2016-07-07T04:53:04","slug":"will-the-robots-take-all-the-jobs","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/07\/06\/will-the-robots-take-all-the-jobs\/","title":{"rendered":"Will the robots take all the jobs?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><em>This article is part of a continuing series leading up to <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/change\/\">Gigaom Change<\/a><\/strong>, which will be held in September in Austin, Texas.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Humans have always had a love\/hate relationship with labor saving devices.

We might regard what Buckminster Fuller had to say on the topic:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><em>Robotics, and its impact on business, will be one of seven topic areas covered at the <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/change\/\">Gigaom Change Leader&#8217;s Summit<\/a><\/strong> in September in Austin. <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/change\/ticket-registration\/\">Join us<\/a><\/strong>.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This article is part of a continuing series leading up to Gigaom Change, which will be held in September in Austin, Texas.&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":404,"featured_media":950344,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[359256381,359216870],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950343"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/404"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=950343"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950343\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/950344"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=950343"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=950343"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=950343"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":950331,"date":"2016-07-05T10:23:03","date_gmt":"2016-07-05T17:23:03","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=950331"},"modified":"2016-07-05T10:23:03","modified_gmt":"2016-07-05T17:23:03","slug":"us-judge-confuses-privacy-and-security-concludes-that-you-should-have-neither","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/07\/05\/us-judge-confuses-privacy-and-security-concludes-that-you-should-have-neither\/","title":{"rendered":"US Judge confuses privacy and security, concludes that you should have neither"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Senior U.S. District Judge Henry Coke Morgan Jr. a federal judge for the Eastern District of Virginia has ruled that the user of any computer which\u00a0connects to the Internet should not have an expectation of privacy because computer security is ineffectual at stopping hackers.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.documentcloud.org\/documents\/2896909-Opinion-and-Order-in-Matish.html\">ruling <\/a>made on June 23<sup>rd<\/sup> was reached in one of the many cases resulting from the FBI&#8217;s infiltration of PlayPen, a hidden child exploitation site on the Tor network. After taking control of the site, the FBI kept it up and running, using it to plant malware on visitors\u2019 computers, gathering identifying information that was used to enable prosecution.<\/p>\n<p>JCM ruled that the FBI&#8217;s actions in hacking visitors&#8217; computers did not violate Fourth Amendment protections and did not require a warrant, stating that the <em>\u201cDefendant here should have been aware that by going [on-line] to access Playpen, he diminished his expectation of privacy.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>JCM offered as an analogy a previous case (<a href=\"https:\/\/supreme.justia.com\/cases\/federal\/us\/525\/83\/case.html\">Minnesota v. Carter\u00a0525 U.S. 83 &#8211; 1998<\/a>) which\u00a0ruled that a police officer looking through broken window blinds does not violate anyone&#8217;s Fourth Amendment rights, so hacking a computer does not either.<\/p>\n<pre>\u201cJust as the area into which the officer in Carter peered - an apartment - usually is afforded Fourth Amendment protection, a computer afforded Fourth Amendment protection in other circumstances is not protected from Government actors who take advantage of an easily broken system to peer into a user's computer. People who traverse the Internet ordinarily understand the risk associated with doing so.\u201d<\/pre>\n<p>JCM notes that in 2007 the Ninth Circuit found that connecting to a network did not eliminate the reasonable expectation of privacy in one&#8217;s computer, but takes the position that in the last nine years things have changed enough to render this position outdated.<\/p>\n<pre>\u201cNow, it seems unreasonable to think that a computer connected to the Web is immune from invasion. Indeed, the opposite holds true: in today's digital world, it appears to be a virtual certainty that computers accessing the Internet can - and eventually will - be hacked.\u201d<\/pre>\n<p>As justification for this opinion, JCM cites the Ashley Madison hack and a Pew Research Center study on privacy and information sharing as evidence of the acceptance that hacking is inevitable. The Pew study looked at American\u2019s attitudes to sharing personal information in return for receiving something of perceived value. Although the focus of the Pew report was on privacy and not security it did report that focus group participants \u201c<em>worried about hackers&#8221;<\/em>. However, these concerns were expressed exclusively in terms of a hacker\u2019s ability to gain access to personal data from compromised business computer systems, not personal\u00a0systems in the home.<\/p>\n<p>Judge Coke Morgan\u2019s level of technical understanding appears to be highly selective. The same judge who ruled on a patent case between Vir2us, INC. and INVINCEA, INC. over competing claims covering advanced anti-malware products, fails to acknowledge that anti-malware products continue to advance. In offering\u00a0that <em>\u201cTerrorists no longer can rely on Apple to protect their electronically stored private data, as it has been publicly reported that the Government can find alternative ways to unlock Apple users&#8217; iPhones.\u201d<\/em>\u00a0He ignores the level of expertise needed to identify the exploit that was used to access the phone used by one of the San Bernardino attackers, or that the hack in question was only applicable to the now superseded iPhone 5C. While it may be possible to unlock older iPhones running back-level OS releases lacking the most up-to-date security features, Apple continues to develop new hardware-based security features and works to fix security vulnerabilities as it finds them. While it is reasonable to claim that many\u00a0computers are vulnerable to attack, in suggesting that this means it is <em>&#8220;a virtual certainty that [all] computers accessing the Internet can &#8211; and eventually will &#8211; be hacked&#8221;\u00a0<\/em>or that there is nothing that can be done to mitigate this risk, JCM is either being deliberately disingenuous or is failing in his analysis.<\/p>\n<p>Describing the ruling as <em>\u201cdangerously flawed\u201d<\/em> EFF Senior Staff Attorney Mark Rumold <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eff.org\/deeplinks\/2016\/06\/federal-court-fourth-amendment-does-not-protect-your-home-computer\">wrote<\/a> <em>\u201cThe implications for the decision, if upheld, are staggering: law enforcement would be free to remotely search and seize information from your computer, without a warrant, without probable cause, or without any suspicion at all.\u201d<\/em> But holds out that the ruling is <em>\u201cincorrect as a matter of law, and we expect there is little chance it would hold up on appeal.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Senior U.S. District Judge Henry Coke Morgan Jr. a federal judge for the Eastern District of Virginia has ruled that the user&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":251813,"featured_media":950336,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[359216366,359219261,359256494],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950331"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/251813"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=950331"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950331\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/950336"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=950331"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=950331"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=950331"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":950324,"date":"2016-06-30T12:12:13","date_gmt":"2016-06-30T19:12:13","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=950324"},"modified":"2016-07-01T09:05:35","modified_gmt":"2016-07-01T16:05:35","slug":"new-speakers-added-to-lineup-at-gigaom-change-2016","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/06\/30\/new-speakers-added-to-lineup-at-gigaom-change-2016\/","title":{"rendered":"New speakers added to lineup at Gigaom Change 2016"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Join us in Austin for <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/change\/\">Gigaom Change<\/a><\/strong> where we will explore the impact of seven technologies that will change the way you do business forever.<\/p>\n<p>Over an immersive two and a half days, we will cover Artificial Intelligence, Virtual + Augmented Reality, Robotics, Nanotechnology, Cybersecurity, 3D+ Printing, and Human-Machine Interfaces to understand how these technologies are transforming industry, and why this all matters. <\/p>\n<p>Helping bridge the gap between today&#8217;s business operations and tomorrow&#8217;s demanding expectations, our carefully curated league of 20+ innovative speakers will showcase how business leaders can stop wondering what the future will bring, and instead start building for it. <\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re excited to announce three new speakers added to our lineup for <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/change\/\">Gigaom Change 2016<\/a><\/strong>!<\/p>\n<div class=\"clearfix\">\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/change\/speakers\/dr-heike-riel\/\"><img src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/themes\/go-ossein\/library\/images\/gigaom-change\/speaker-heike-riel.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"167\" class=\"alignleft\" alt=\"Dr. Heike Riel\" \/><\/a>Speaking on the subject of nanotechnology is <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/change\/speakers\/dr-heike-riel\/\">Dr. Heike Riel<\/a>, IBM Fellow &#038; Director Physical Sciences Department, IBM Research.

From 1990 to 1994, Morie worked at the University of Central Florida\u2019s Institute for Simulation and Training. While there, she developed multi-sensory techniques for VR that predictably elicit emotional responses from participants. In 1999, she helped establish the USC Institute for Creative Technologies, an Army-funded research lab finding connections between entertainment and military needs and expanding her work in emotionally evocative VR, including patenting a scent collar to deliver evocative odors to participants within immersive experiences.<\/p>\n<p>In 2013 Morie started All These Worlds, LLC to promote virtual environments and technology for healing. Her Coming Home project, started in 2009, created a center in the online world Second Life, where veterans and soldiers in need could find stress relief and rehabilitation activities. She also recently created a virtual world ecosystem called ANSIBLE for NASA designed to provide psychological benefits for future astronauts who will undertake extremely long missions to Mars. <\/p>\n<p>Dr. Morie\u2019s other research interests include how space, identity and play in virtual worlds can positively affect our human nature, and she has presented this work at conferences worldwide. Her newest startup, The Augmented Traveler, is focused on bringing an augmented reality product to market that will enhance the way people experience travel to all corners of the world.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Morie will be speaking on the subject of virtual and augmented reality at <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/change\/\">Gigaom Change Leaders Summit<\/a> in Austin, September 21-23rd. In anticipation of that, I caught up with her Tuesday, June 21, with a few questions about virtual reality and it&#8217;s potential impact on the business world.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Byron Reese: Your involvement with virtual reality goes way back. When do you remember of the first time you thought about it or encountered the term or fiddled with the device? When did what would become VR first popup in your life?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Jacki Ford Morie:<\/strong> In the late 1980s I became aware of virtual reality and I found a lab in Central Florida that was starting a virtual reality research lab. And so I ended up getting myself hired there so I could work on virtual reality. And that was 1989.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And when you survey, when you flash ahead 27 years to today, how has what happened unfolded in ways that you expected or that you didn&#8217;t expect?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, the thing about actual virtual reality is how amazingly comparable to reality it can be. It doesn&#8217;t have to be photo-realistic but it gives you a believable experience. And that is really the primary thing behind virtual reality. We&#8217;re able to give people a very engaging, compelling, believable, cognitively real experience. Even if it&#8217;s being presented through virtual means.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s happened now, 27 years later, is that everybody wants to be on the VR bandwagon and things are being called virtual reality that have none of those sort of affordances that virtual reality actually allows us to build on.<\/p>\n<p>So things like 360 video, which is nothing more than wrapping a screen around your head on a sphere. That&#8217;s not virtual reality, that&#8217;s another kind of screen that gets wrapped around your head. So I guess the thing that has happened that I could never have anticipated is that many versions of things that are not actually virtual reality are now being called virtual reality and people just keep repeating it because they don&#8217;t know any better, they have a vested interest in making that be something sexy to the general consumer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You mention the consumer. Do you see in the next 10 years virtual reality mainly being a consumer technology or do you see virtual reality, and augmented reality, having an impact on the business world?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Oh absolutely, it&#8217;s going to have an impact on many, many different businesses. The business that wants to get their message out there in a compelling way, there&#8217;s going to be nothing better than virtual reality or augmented reality to do that, because it&#8217;s a multi-sensory mechanism for bringing people into the experience you want them to have.<\/p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s very, very compelling. We go to the theater because it&#8217;s an experience, but if you want to get that theater experience out to more people and preserve the kind of immersive experience that theater-going gives us, that social aspect, then you&#8217;re probably going to want to use virtual reality.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Look at Broadway, they\u2019re maxed out on tickets, they\u2019re maxed out on the prices of these things. How is it going to expand? It&#8217;s very expensive to send a troop to every city in the country. And yet, the demand is there. But imagine if we were able to create those Broadway shows with virtual reality characters who can either act predictably or have some sort of spontaneous elements to them. And this is going to take more doing in terms of getting believable characters who have some sort of emotion behind them.<\/p>\n<p>Right now, real-estate agents are using it to give you tours of a place. So I&#8217;m looking to buy a house in Florida, let&#8217;s say. I don&#8217;t have to get on a plane and go to Florida and walk around 15 houses. I can actually take my first pass of those houses through a virtual reality walkthrough and get a sense of what it&#8217;s like to be in that house.<\/p>\n<p>So here you have those kinds of things. It&#8217;s certainly what IKEA was doing with augmented reality with their catalogues, where you could take the furniture from the IKEA catalogue and place it in front of you in your room space to see what it looked like. That was a great use of augmented reality and we&#8217;re going to see a lot more of these things.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>So I think what we&#8217;re going to find is a seamless continuum from reality to mixed reality, augmented reality, that purely virtual thing that can immerse you and separate you from the physical world. And I can think of very few markets that might not have a benefit from this kind of technology.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And to go back to a comment you made earlier about the phrase, &#8220;trying to mean everything and therefore meaning nothing,&#8221; do you consider augmented reality in the camp of really being virtual reality because they are immersive and they respond to your movement and all that, or is even augmented reality not something you would call virtual?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, they all use digital technology in some ways. The difference between virtual reality in its purest form and augmented reality in its original context is that pure virtual reality requires you to put on some kind of device, usually a head-mounted display, that separates you from the physical world to immerse you in something where any sort of extraneous signals coming from something that&#8217;s not the experience being provided to you in virtual reality, they can&#8217;t intrude.<\/p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s amusing to go to the meet-ups and conferences right now where somebody puts you in a head-mounted display, mind you designed to separate you from the distractions of the physical world and allow you to focus on that immersive experiences that&#8217;s been created.\u00a0And the first thing they do is tap you on the shoulder and say, \u201chey, you can look around.\u201d Or what you&#8217;re hearing is the glaring sound from the exhibition floor.<\/p>\n<p>Now, augmented reality by context is designed so that it overlays some sort of imagery on to the physical world. So it doesn&#8217;t work without the physical world. It&#8217;s augmenting the reality you have. So they&#8217;re kind of two ends of the spectrum. Maybe you put full physical reality at the very end of the spectrum and the augmented reality is in there. And there are favorites of that where it&#8217;s more augmented than it is reality or more reality than it is augmented.<\/p>\n<p>So for example, your augmentation might be hold your phone up and it says, there&#8217;s a great restaurant down this street. And then at the other end you have experiences that require you to separate yourself from the physicality of everyday life. And that&#8217;s the pure form of virtual reality.\u00a0So it&#8217;s a continuum. They&#8217;re all using virtual technology but in different ways for different purposes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you think there&#8217;s a chance that a significant portion of the population will put on a virtual reality headset and never take it off?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s going to happen.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And why do you think that?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s enough content in the world for somebody to put one on and never take it off.<\/p>\n<p><strong>But I don&#8217;t mean, literally never take it off. But the people who already spend enormous amounts of time in virtual worlds, now we&#8217;ve essentially made the virtual world even that much more immersive and believable. So that you have significant number of people that just kind of disappear into those worlds because they consider them more attractive than the real world.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Perhaps there is a subset of a population who was so unsatisfied with their actual lives for whatever reasons. They could be shut ins, or live in a very remote area or whatever. Those people might find a lot of satisfaction being primarily in a virtual space. I think well-rounded individuals will probably balance their time between the physical and the virtual for very good reasons.<\/p>\n<p>You have to be getting something valuable out of immersing yourself in a virtual space and separating yourself from the physical world. I don&#8217;t see that amount of satisfaction, except for those cases I mentioned, for most of the population any time soon.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Maybe in a 100 years when we really need to go into something that&#8217;s been created for us because everything else has degraded to the point that we do have an apocalyptic future and we live in a matrix. That type of thing. But I really don&#8217;t see that happening. I think there&#8217;s too many things about life itself that can&#8217;t be delivered through a virtual experience and a head-managed display that is going to forego that kind of situation, where most people want to just live in their virtual space all the time.<\/p>\n<p>And then there&#8217;s questions like, okay, how did those people even support themselves? And things like that. So, you know, there&#8217;s just a lot of social and economic barriers to that type of thing happening. I think if people talk about it it&#8217;s more of a scare thing than a reality that I envision happening any time soon.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Alright. Let&#8217;s leave it there.

While most complain that WebRTC isn\u2019t suitable for the enterprise, it is probably the next best thing happening to enterprises. And it is all because we\u2019re in the midst of a digital transformation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WebRTC is a five-year-old technology, so it is rather new to the scene. At its core, WebRTC enables adding real-time voice and video communications to any website without the need to download a thing. Need to get a customer on a quick support call? Just send him a URL.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The naysayers dismiss WebRTC because it still isn\u2019t available on Safari or Internet Explorer. While that is true, it is changing. Support already exist in the new Microsoft Edge browser with reassuring rumors about Apple and Safari\u2019s plans towards WebRTC. Ubiquitous <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/bloggeek.me\/microsoft-apple-webrtc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WebRTC support everywhere<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is on the horizon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which brings me to enterprises.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enterprises today are going through a digital transformation. In each and every vertical, businesses are being redefined by having the information that runs through the enterprise turned into digital assets that are then used to drive business processes and analytics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This takes shape in many different ways: enabling customers to use self-service channels instead of using human operated contact centers, using big data and data lake projects to deduce insights and personalize services, streamlining sales processes through marketing automation, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make this happen, enterprises must integrate the different IT services they employ internally. The ERP system must connect to the e-commerce site, which must be integrated with the contact center, that in turn has to be accessible to the marketer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until a few years ago, such projects were only available to the largest of enterprises, relying heavily on protocols such as SOAP and products such as ESBs (Enterprise Service Bus). It takes many man months and lots of dollars to build such integrations, and they oftentimes end up failing due to their size and complexity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In recent years, though, such integrations have shifted towards the use of REST. A lightweight cousin of SOAP. To explain REST, you need only look at your browser address bar &#8211; REST is essentially a URL call, similar to how you load a web page &#8211; but used by a program. While REST is rather loosely defined, the number of tools for handling it is growing rapidly and has come to a point where it is ready to replace SOAP.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost every new product or service that is being introduced to the market today includes a REST API, enabling integrators or developers to access it\u00a0programmatically &#8211; in ways a lot easier than the older SOAP mechanism.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This change is coupled with the migration of IT towards cloud services. One where certain services are consumed from remote data centers instead of being installed and managed on-premise. This necessitates solid and publicly available APIs to use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WebRTC fits perfectly in this brave new world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up until today, communications took place in a separate logical and often times even physical network. Be it cellular, wireline or VoIP service, these get built in its own private network or virtual LAN within the enterprise. And the interfaces built into these products in one of two ways: communication-based, which is hard to handle (think SIP or Megaco as an API layer for IT developers); or on some proprietary API that is hard to interface and integrate with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WebRTC changes all that. It not only makes VoIP more accessible as a technology, but it almost forces developers to think with standard web protocols on how to use and deploy it. As an example, it gets your CRM vendor build his own contact center, many times with players such as Twilio who offer their own <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.twilio.com\/webrtc\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WebRTC SDK<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is no wonder that enterprise vendors are adopting WebRTC en masse. Adopters include Oracle, IBM, Cisco, Atlassian, Slack and many others.

Like any such subjective list, it was met with criticism in its own time. The historian Herodotus couldn\u2019t believe the Egyptian Labyrinth was left off and Callimachus argued forcefully for the Ishtar Gate to be included. <\/p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/change\/\">Gigaom Change<\/a> in September (early adopter pricing still available), we will explore the seven technologies that I think will most affect business in the near future. I would like to list the seven technologies I chose and why I chose them. Would you have picked something different? <\/p>\n<p>Here is my list:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Robots<\/strong> \u2013 This one is pretty easy. Even if you make your trade in 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s and never touch an atom, robots will still impact some aspect of your business, even if it is upstream. Additionally, the issue of robots has launched a societal debate about unemployment, minimum wage, basic income, and the role of &#8220;working for a living&#8221; in the modern world. We have dreamed of robots for eons, feared them for decades, and now we finally get to see what their real effect on humanity will be.<\/p>\n<p><strong>AI<\/strong> \u2013 This is also, forgive the pun, a no-brainer. AI is a tricky one though. Some of the smartest people on the planet (Hawking, Gates, Musk) say we should fear it while others, such as the Chief Scientist of Baidu say worrying about AI is like worrying about overpopulation on Mars. Further, the estimates to when we might see an AGI (artificial general intelligence, an AI that can do a wide range of tasks like a human) varies from 5 years to 500 years. Our brains are, arguably, what make us human, and the idea that an artificial brain might be made gets our attention. What effect will this have on the workplace? We will find out.<\/p>\n<p><strong>AR\/VR<\/strong> \u2013 Although we think of AR\/VR as (at first) a consumer technology, the work applications are equally significant. You only have to put on a VR headset for about three minutes to see that some people, maybe a good number, will put this device on and never take it off. But on the work front, it is still an incredibly powerful tool, able to overlay information from the digital world onto the world of atoms. Our brains aren\u2019t quite wired up to imagine this in its full flowering, but we will watch it unfold in the next decade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Human\/Machine Interface<\/strong> \u2013 Also bridging the gap between the real world and the virtual one is the whole HMI front. As machines become ever more ubiquitous, our need to seamlessly interface with them grows.  HMI is a wide spectrum of technologies: From good UIs to eye-tracking hardware to biological implants, HMI will grow to the point where the place where the human ends and the machine begins will get really blurry.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3D Printing<\/strong> \u2013 We call this part of Gigaom Change \u201c3D Printing\u201d but we mean it to include all the new ways we make stuff today.  But there isn\u2019t a single term that encapsulates that, so 3D Printing will have to suffice. While most of our first-hand experience with 3D printing is single-color plastic demo pieces, there is an entire industry working on 3D printing new hearts and livers, as well as more mundane items like clothing and food (\u201cEarl Grey, hot\u201d). From a business standpoint, the idea that quantity one has the same unit price as quantity one-thousand is powerful and is something we will see play out sooner than later. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Nanotechnology<\/strong> \u2013 I get the most pushback from nano because it seems so far out there. But it really isn&#8217;t. By one estimate, there are two thousand nanotech products on the market today. Nano, building things with dimensions of between 1 and 100 nanometers, is already a multi-billion dollar industry. On the consumer side, we will see nano robots that swim around in your blood cleaning up what ails you. But on the business side, we will see a re-thinking of all of the material sciences. The very substances we deal with will change, and we may even be said to be not in the iron nor stone age, but the nano age, where we make materials that were literally impossible to create just a few years ago. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Cybersecurity<\/strong> \u2013 This may seem to be the one item that is least like all of the others, for it isn&#8217;t a specific technology per se.

What are the most telling, the most revealing sorts of thing people say or do that, for business purposes, tells you who they are?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Jason Baldridge&gt; People explicitly declare a portion of their interests in topics like sports, music, and politics in their bios and posts. This is part of their outward presentation of their selves: how they wish to be perceived by others and which content they believe will be of greatest interest to their audience. Other aspects are less immediately obvious, such as interests revealed through the social graph. This includes not just which accounts they follow, but the interests of the people they are most highly connected to (which may have been expressed in their posts and their own graph connections).<\/p>\n<p>A person&#8217;s social activity can also reveal many other aspects, including demographics (e.g. gender, age, racial identity, location, and income) and psychographics (e.g. personality and status). Demographics are a core set of attributes used by most marketers. The ability to predict these (rather than using explicit declarations or surveys) enables many standard market research questions to be answered quickly and at a scale previously unattainable.<\/p>\n<p><em>Seth&gt; And what can one learn from\u00a0these analyses?<\/em><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_950257\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/PeoplePatternAudiencePage.20160621-1-e1466602821798.png\"><img src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/PeoplePatternAudiencePage.20160621-1-e1466602821798.png\" alt=\"People Pattern Audience Page\" width=\"600\" height=\"853\" class=\"size-full wp-image-950257\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">People Pattern Audience Page<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Personas and associated language use.<\/p>\n<p>As a whole, this kind of analysis allows us to standardize large populations (e.g. millions of people) on a common set of demographic variables and interests (possibly derived from people speaking different languages) and then support exploratory data analysis via unsupervised learning algorithms. For example, we use sparse factor analysis to find the correlated interests in an audience and furthermore group the individuals who are best fits for those factors. We call these discovered personas because they reveal clusters of individuals with related interests that distinguish them from other groups in the audience, and they have associated aggregate demographics&#8212;the usual things that go into building a persona segment by hand.<\/p>\n<p>We can then show the words, phrases, entities, and accounts that the individuals in each persona discuss with respect to each of the interests. For example, one segment might discuss Christian themes with respect to religion, while others might discuss Muslim or New Age ones. Marketers can then use these to create tailored content for ads that are delivered directly to the individuals in a given persona, using our audience dashboard. There are of course other uses, such as social science questions. I&#8217;ve personally used it to look into audiences related to Black Lives Matter and understand how different groups of people talk about politics<\/p>\n<p>Our audience dashboard is backed by Elastic Search, so you can also use search terms to find segments via self-declared allegiances for such polarizing topics.<\/p>\n<p>A shout-out &#8212;<\/p>\n<p>Personality and status are generally revealed through subtle linguistic indicators that my University of Texas Austin colleague <a href=\"http:\/\/liberalarts.utexas.edu\/psychology\/faculty\/pennebak\" target=\"_blank\">James Pennebaker<\/a> has studied for the past three decades and is now commercializing with his start-up company <a href=\"http:\/\/www.receptiviti.ai\/\" target=\"_blank\">Receptiviti<\/a>. These include detecting and counting different types of words, such as function words (e.g. determiners and prepositions) or cognitive terms (such as &#8220;because&#8221; and &#8220;therefore&#8221;), and seeing how a given individual&#8217;s rates of use of those word classes compares to known profiles of the different personality types.<\/p>\n<p><em>So personas, language use, topics. How do behavioral analyses contribute to overall understanding?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Many behaviors reveal important aspects about an account that a human would struggle to infer. For example, the times at which an account regularly posts is a strong indicator of whether they are a person, organization or spam account. Organization accounts often automate their sharing, and they tend to post at regular intervals or common times, usually on the hour or half hour. Spam accounts often post at a regular frequency\u00a0&#8212;\u00a0perhaps every 8 minutes, plus or minus one minute. An actual person posts in accordance with sleep, work, and play activities, with greater variance &#8212; including sporadic bursts of activity and long periods of inactivity.<\/p>\n<p><em>Any other elements?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Graph connections are especially useful for bespoke, super-specific interests and questions. For example, we used graph connections to build a pro-life\/pro-choice classifier for one client to rank over 200,000 individuals in greater Texas on a scale from most likely to be pro-life to most-likely to be pro-choice. By using known pro-life and pro-choice accounts, it was straightforward to gather examples of individuals with a strong affiliation to one side or the other and learn a classifier based on their graph connections that was then applied to the graph connections of individuals who follow none of those accounts.<\/p>\n<p><em>Could you say a bit about how People Pattern identifies salient data and makes sense of it, the algorithms?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The starting point is to identify an audience. Often this is simply the people who follow a brand and\/or its competitors, or who comment on their products or use certain hashtags. We can also connect the individuals in a CRM to their corresponding social accounts. This process, which we refer to as stitching, uses identity resolution algorithms that make predictions based on names, locations, email addresses and how well they match corresponding fields in the social profiles. After identifying high confidence matches, we can then append their profile analysis to their CRM data. This can inform an email campaign, or be the start for lead generation, and more.<\/p>\n<p>Making sense of data &#8212; let&#8217;s look at three aspects &#8212; demographics, interests, and location &#8212;<\/p>\n<p>Our demographics classifiers are based on supervised training from millions of annotated examples. We use logistic regression for attributes like gender, race, and account type. For age, we use linear regression techniques that allow us characterize the model&#8217;s confidence in its predictions\u00a0&#8212;\u00a0this allows us to provide more accurate aggregate estimates for arbitrary sets of social profiles. This is especially important for alcohol brands that need to ensure they are engaging with age-appropriate audiences. All of these classifiers are backed by rules that detect self-declared information when it is available (e.g. many people state\u00a0their age in their bio).<\/p>\n<p>We capture explicit interests with text classifiers. We use a proprietary semi-supervised algorithm for building classifiers from small amounts of human supervision and large amounts of unlabeled texts. Importantly, this allows us to support new languages quickly and at lower cost, compared to fully supervised models. We can also use classifiers built this way to generate features for other tasks. For example, we are able to learn classifiers that identify language associated with people of different age groups, and this produces an array of features used by our age classifiers. They are also great inputs for deep learning for NLP and they are different from the usual unsupervised word vectors people commonly use.<\/p>\n<p>For location, we use our internally developed adaptation of spatial label propagation. With this technique, you start with a set of accounts that have explicitly declared their location (in their bio or through geo tags), and then these locations are spread through graph connections to infer locations for accounts that have not stated their location explicitly. This method can resolve over half of individuals to within 10 kilometers of their true location. Determining this information is important for many marketing questions (e.g. how does my audience in Dallas differ from my audience in Seattle?) It obviously also brings up privacy concerns. We use these determinations for aggregate analyses but don&#8217;t show them at the individual profile level. However, people should be aware that variations of these algorithms are published and there are open source implementations, so leaving their location field blank is by no means sufficient to ensure your home location isn&#8217;t discoverable by others.<\/p>\n<p><em>My impression is that People Pattern, with an interplay of multiple algorithms and data types and multi-stage analysis processes, is a level more complex than most new-to-the-market systems. How do you excel while avoiding over-engineering that leads to a brittle solution?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s on ongoing process, with plenty of bumps and bruises along the way. I&#8217;m very fortunate that my co-founder, Ken Cho, has deep experience in enterprise social media applications. Ken co-founded <a href=\"https:\/\/www.spredfast.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Spredfast<\/a> [an enterprise social media marketing platform]. He has strong intuitions on what kind of data will be useful to marketers, and we work together to figure out whether it is possible to extract and\/or predict the data.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve struck on a number of things that work really well, such as predicting core demographics and interests and doing clustering based on those. Other things have worked well, but didn&#8217;t provide enough value or were too confusing to users. For example, we used to support both interest-level keyword analysis (which words does this audience use with respect to &#8220;music&#8221;) and topic modeling, which produces clusters of semantically related words given all the posts by people in the audience, in (almost) real-time. The topics were interesting because they showed groupings of interests that weren&#8217;t captured by our interest hierarchy (such as music events), but it was expensive to support topic model analysis given our RESTful architecture and we chose to deprecate that capability. We have since reworked our infrastructure so that we can support some of those analyses in batch (rather than streaming) mode for deeper audience analyses. This is also important for supporting multiple influence scores computed with respect to a fixed audience rather than generic overall influence scores.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, I&#8217;ve learned to think about approaching a new kind of analysis not just with respect to the modeling, but as importantly to consider whether we can get the data needed at the time that the user wants the analysis, how costly the infrastructure to support it will be, and how valuable it is likely to be. We&#8217;ve done some post-hoc reconsiderations along these lines, which has led to streamlining capabilities.<\/p>\n<p><em>Other factors?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Another key part of this is having the right engineering team to plan and implement the necessary infrastructure. Steve Blackmon joined us a year ago, and his deep experience in big data and machine learning problems has allowed us to build our people database in a scalable, repeatable manner. This means we now have 200+ million profiles that have demographics, interests and more already pre-computed. More importantly, we now have recipes and infrastructure for developing further classifiers and analyses. This allows us to get them into our product more quickly. Another important recent hire was our product manager Omid Sedaghatian. Omid\u00a0is doing a fantastic job of figuring out what aspects of our application are excelling, which aren&#8217;t delivering expected\u00a0value, and how we can streamline and simplify everything we do.<\/p>\n<p><em>Excuse the flattery, but it&#8217;s clear your enthusiasm and your willingness to share your knowledge are huge assets for People Pattern.

Either delivered in-house or increasingly via outsourced service providers, it can be a deeply frustrating experience for client and support staff alike: Visualize the client\u2019s inevitably imperfect description of their issue, identify a likely solution, and then laboriously walk the client through the steps to address whatever problem is at hand. It\u2019s a process that can be painfully slow, and overrun with errors and missteps. The obvious way to eradicate this torture is through an endpoint management system which as well as providing configuration management, usually offer virtual deskside support services to deliver remote viewing and remote desktop control. These tools enable the Service Desk to see their client\u2019s problem first-hand, shortening time to repair, and eliminating the frustrations of telephone support.<\/p>\n<p>As good as today\u2019s enterprise endpoint management systems are, there are an increasing number of situations where they cannot be used. The rapid growth of the consumerization of IT over the last five years has seen individual employees and departments bypass centralized IT services in favor of SaaS providers to plug the gaps in the enterprise supported application portfolio. Getting effective support for SaaS apps takes a little more work. Lacking any onsite presence, If SaaS venders want to provide virtual deskside support they can\u2019t rely on their customer\u2019s remote support systems, nor are they able to install large footprint endpoint management tools of their own. Instead they have to use lighter, small or zero footprint remote support apps, that can be run on demand without prior installation and without needing elevated privileges.<\/p>\n<p>FixMe.IT straddles the boundary between being a lightweight web-based remote support app ideal for SaaS providers, and a not quite enterprise-class product. Its lightweight client makes it a good fit for SaaS providers, but at the same time it\u2019s far more than just a remote control app and has enough advanced features to make of interest to SME customers looking for a richer remote support tool. As well as being able to either shadow or control the client\u2019s desktop, support staff get both a virtual laser pointer and pen to annotate the remote display, tools that can be very helpful when it comes to supporting busy apps with complex user interfaces. There\u2019s a well thought out admin console that enables support staff to manage multiple concurrent support sessions as well as a basic logging tool to keep track of time spent on support sessions. Support staff also have the option of recording support sessions for audit or training purposes, and can also share their own desktop with the customer, useful for one on one training, or for customer\u2019s whose data security concerns make them unwilling to share their own desktop while still looking to benefit from visual hand holding. While admins might find FixMe.IT&#8217;s rich remote support features provide the biggest benefit from their customers&#8217; perspective, it also provides great value as a flexible, easy to use alternative to Microsoft\u2019s Remote Desktop Connection tool. Admins can create a list of remote physical or virtual systems authorized for unattended access. Once created, the FixMe.IT admin console makes it simple to switch between a client\u2019s desktop and any remote systems needed to troubleshoot and resolve issues. And knowing that FixMe.IT is always available for ad hoc connections can bring peace of mind to those who need remote access to their workstations on the go.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/1-FixMeIT-session-admin.jpg\"><img src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/1-FixMeIT-session-admin-680x530.jpg\" alt=\"1 - FixMeIT-session-admin\" width=\"680\" height=\"530\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-950246\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/1-FixMeIT-session-admin-680x530.jpg 680w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/1-FixMeIT-session-admin-300x234.jpg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/1-FixMeIT-session-admin-768x598.jpg 768w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/1-FixMeIT-session-admin-968x754.jpg 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/1-FixMeIT-session-admin-180x140.jpg 180w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/1-FixMeIT-session-admin-32x25.jpg 32w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/1-FixMeIT-session-admin-64x50.jpg 64w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/1-FixMeIT-session-admin-320x249.jpg 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/1-FixMeIT-session-admin-640x499.jpg 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/1-FixMeIT-session-admin-804x626.jpg 804w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/1-FixMeIT-session-admin.jpg 1091w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/a>\n<p>FixMe.IT is offered as service; customers can choose either to buy a fixed number of support sessions, that can be consumed any way they wish, or buy a flexible use license limited only by the number of concurrent users on the service desk \u2013 there\u2019s no license cost for the client-side component.

Making it possible for support personnel to install updates, reboot and reconnect without the customer having to do anything to reinstate the connection. It\u2019s not a unique feature by any means, but it\u2019s the kind of detail that is essential for anyone with an eye of good user experience. This persistence can also be maintained when restarting in Safe Mode and when switching user accounts. The one thing I didn\u2019t like, was the lack of any obvious tell-tale to remind the client that their desktop was being shadowed, controlled, or recorded. The app does provide the client with a log showing that their desktop is being shadowed or controlled, but visible tell-tale in the foreground would be preferable. As it is, this won\u2019t be to be an issue for much longer, Techinline already has plans to incorporate this in a future release.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/3-FixMeIT-remote-control.jpeg\"><img src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/3-FixMeIT-remote-control-680x159.jpeg\" alt=\"3 - FixMeIT-remote-control\" width=\"680\" height=\"159\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-950248\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/3-FixMeIT-remote-control-680x159.jpeg 680w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/3-FixMeIT-remote-control-300x70.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/3-FixMeIT-remote-control-768x180.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/3-FixMeIT-remote-control-968x227.jpeg 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/3-FixMeIT-remote-control-210x49.jpeg 210w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/3-FixMeIT-remote-control-107x25.jpeg 107w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/3-FixMeIT-remote-control-213x50.jpeg 213w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/3-FixMeIT-remote-control-320x75.jpeg 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/3-FixMeIT-remote-control-640x150.jpeg 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/3-FixMeIT-remote-control-804x188.jpeg 804w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/3-FixMeIT-remote-control.jpeg 1186w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/a>\n<p>What FixMe.IT doesn\u2019t have today is support for Apple OS X or Chrome OS.

Those interactions are a lot like chat in Slack, it seems. Is that a motivation?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Adrien Sommier<\/strong>: Amplement is a web application which enables users to collaborate and discuss in real time with other professionals around the world. We aren&#8217;t like Linkedin or Xing because we aren&#8217;t a social network.<\/p>\n<p>Before Amplement, professionals couldn&#8217;t use a single website for business interaction. They were forced to use many tools: Slack for collaboration, Linkedin to find profiles of other professionals, and Skype to conduct real time discussions or video calls.<\/p>\n<p>Amplement is the only web application which brings together &#8212; on a single platform &#8212; all the tools professionals need. It&#8217;s a single page application.<\/p>\n<p>So, to answer your question precisely, we are a little competitor for Slack, for Yammer, for LinkedIn, for Skype. You see?<\/p>\n<p><strong>G<\/strong>: An all-in-one tool for professional communication. I see. But the challenge for you is this: will people that are already using Slack, Skype, Yammer, and so on switch to using Amplement?<\/p>\n<p><strong>AS<\/strong>: There\u2019s basically nobody in the professional world who doesn\u2019t already use one of those tools. That tells me that most, if not all, of the 700 new users we get each day are open to trying alternatives.<\/p>\n<p>The thing that keeps people from adopting new platforms is hesitation to add \u201cyet another app\u201d to their workflow. We don\u2019t face that issue because we\u2019re condensing their workflow, not bloating it. That and we have an extremely short learning curve, so those who can\u2019t yet replace their use of Skype, Slack, etc. entirely don\u2019t have anything to lose with us.<\/p>\n<p><strong>G<\/strong>: Is job search the primary use case, or just a way to monetize the professional network?<\/p>\n<p><strong>AS<\/strong>: No, in fact the job search isn&#8217;t hasn\u2019t yet launched in the U.S. Unlike LinkedIn, our job search feature isn\u2019t there for monetization, but instead because it\u2019s an important feature for our members. On a professional platform, people want to manage their professional careers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>G<\/strong>: Which means connecting with others and sharing profiles? Is that the model?<\/p>\n<p><strong>AS<\/strong>: That\u2019s right. And since you use the same profile for your career development and your daily work, employers can import the same profiles they used to hire someone directly into their work channels. They\u2019ll be all ready to work before their first day in the office!<\/p>\n<p><strong>G<\/strong>: I&#8217;ve read that Amplement has over 400,000 members, and over 100,000 job offers have been made since the 2013 launch. What are the user expectations when they join?<\/p>\n<p><strong>AS<\/strong>: We have a half a million active users. Users join Amplement because it&#8217;s the fastest app for finding other professionals, communicating with them, and doing both quickly.<\/p>\n<p><strong>G<\/strong>: Amplement does not offer file sharing or integrations with Google Drive or Dropbox, at least not yet. Is that on the roadmap? What other features can we expect in the future? Bots?<\/p>\n<p><strong>AS<\/strong>: We plan to support file sharing soon. Users will be able to work with their teams on Amplement like other tools, such as Slack. We have not developed the integrations, but that\u2019s underway.<\/p>\n<p><strong>G<\/strong>: What about LinkedIn\u2019s approach to support posting, updates, and so on? Will we be seeing that in Amplement?<\/p>\n<p><strong>AS<\/strong>: Staying up-to-date with your network is a key part of your career, so absolutely. Many of those features are already finished.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>The recent acquisition of Linkedin by Microsoft shows that the integration of professional networks and the tools that people use to get their work done makes sense. Amplement&#8217;s founder, Adrien Sommier, may have seen that future fusion coming earlier than others.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I recently learned about Amplement, an intriguing tool for professionals to communicate and interact, with a clean and minimal design with features&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2184122,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950215"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2184122"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=950215"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950215\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=950215"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=950215"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=950215"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":950194,"date":"2016-06-15T07:32:07","date_gmt":"2016-06-15T14:32:07","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=950194"},"modified":"2016-06-15T07:40:26","modified_gmt":"2016-06-15T14:40:26","slug":"zenefits-makes-more-cuts-twitter-selfies-dropbox-profitable","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/06\/15\/zenefits-makes-more-cuts-twitter-selfies-dropbox-profitable\/","title":{"rendered":"Zenefits makes more cuts; Twitter Selfies; Dropbox profitable*"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Zenefits, the\u00a0online HR platform that ousted its founding CEO recently as a part of a regulatory investigation regarding insurance sales (where the company makes its money), <a href=\"https:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/williamalden\/zenefits-laying-off-100-more-employees-will-pay-others-to-qu?utm_term=.yv0Wj7qol#.bvMKRPL8X\">has announced more layoffs<\/a>, an additional 9% of the company&#8217;s workforce, around 100 people. 250 were cut in February, as part of a revamp of sales and operations, following David Sacks &#8212; the former CEO of Yammer &#8212; assuming the helm as CEO.\u00a0The company was valued at $4.5 billion in a raise of capital last year, and has disrupted the market for HR tools.

It\u2019s worth reviewing a number of other areas where screen use is prevalent, and seeing these as input to the decision process.<\/p>\n<p>First, the smart screen has come a long way.\u00a0Back in the early nineties, I can remember de-boxing a whiteboard with a built in printer; since then such devices have become giant input and output panels. Pioneer in the field is <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2015\/08\/12\/digital-signage-in-higher-education-keep-your-campus-informed\/\">education<\/a>: from\u00a0sharing an office <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bettshow.com\/Exhibitor\/VII-Networks\">with<\/a> a manufacturer of interactive whiteboards for this sector, I\u2019ve seen just how much of a difference such technologies can have on classrooms.<\/p>\n<p>Most importantly, it\u2019s not about the screen but the environment. Consider, for example, the ability to create information on a tablet computer, then share it onto a screen for somebody else to edit. Imagine being able to do this on a wall screen in the meeting room, with input from people in another office.<\/p>\n<p>It should be straightforward, and both schools and home tutors are using such capabilities all the time, but they have yet to make an impact in the workplace.<\/p>\n<p>Second, \u2018telepresence\u2019, the term coined by Cisco and also offered by HP to describe the immersive impact of seeing full-sized people on screens in a videoconference. Apart from (addressable through software) issues with eye movement, it\u2019s like they are in the room.<\/p>\n<p>When they were launched a few years ago, such technologies were too costly for all but head office installations. With today\u2019s network bandwidth and with screen costs having plummeted, the \u2018telepresence\u2019 notion has a much broader appeal.<\/p>\n<p>And third, we can look to transactional areas of the business for best practice in terms of screen use. \u2018Starship Enterprise\u2019 style, centralised network and equipment management hubs have plenty to offer in terms of what should be visible on the big screen, and how it should be presented relative to individualised views on smaller desktops.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, call centres and sales environments make extensive use of screens. From these parts of the organisation we can learn not only the options available, but also how to strike a balance between operational efficiency and keeping staff motivated.<\/p>\n<p>Learning from these areas, the bottom line is that digital signage is only part of the opportunity offered by either passive or interactive screens. Direct information sharing, collaboration, workflow management, employee feedback, resource scheduling and booking, training, brainstorming and team building are just a few areas that a deployment can achieve.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps, yes, a quick win is to deploy some screens for the purpose of disseminating information. But,as some sectors are already discovering \u2014 such as <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2016\/01\/15\/business-on-display-digital-signage-webinar-replay\/\">non-obtrusive up-selling in the hospitality sector<\/a>\u2014 active interaction yields new opportunities for enablement and empowerment, beyond passive information sharing.<\/p>\n<p>So, it\u2019s worth thinking outside the box, and treating screens as a viewport onto a shared data set, which can also be accessed via other devices. What starts as digital signage becomes a series of windows onto a brave new world, which drives\u00a0a set of considerations, not least in terms of type, size and location, that should be considered before any deployment.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At first, thinking about digital signage in the workplace makes perfect sense.\u00a0We\u2019re all familiar with big screens in airports, hotel foyers and&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87746169,"featured_media":950190,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[359217300,359217161,359217384],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950189"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87746169"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=950189"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950189\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/950190"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=950189"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=950189"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=950189"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":950186,"date":"2016-06-14T06:42:37","date_gmt":"2016-06-14T13:42:37","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=950186"},"modified":"2016-06-14T06:56:50","modified_gmt":"2016-06-14T13:56:50","slug":"linkedin-is-a-many-splendored-thing-for-microsoft","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/06\/14\/linkedin-is-a-many-splendored-thing-for-microsoft\/","title":{"rendered":"What does Linkedin really mean to Microsoft?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Microsoft has stirred up a swirling buzz of discussion around the Linkedin acquisition for $26.2 billion. There are a number of angles that have been considered in the gazillion news stories floating around. Here&#8217;s a few of those threads:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Linkedin is a Salesforce counter by Satya Nadella<\/strong> &#8212; It has been argued by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/articles\/linkedin-is-microsofts-sales-software-play\">Steve Nellis<\/a> and others that Linkedin&#8217;s efforts at developing and selling the tools in the company&#8217;s Sales Solutions unit have not gone very far, but the data in Linkedin&#8217;s network &#8212; when coupled with Microsoft&#8217;s own Salesforce competitor &#8212; Dynamics &#8212; could become a real player. Note that Nadella&#8217;s rumored efforts to acquire Salesforce stalled because of a too-high price tag (10X revenues), while Linkedin was much more affordable (7X revenues). Plus, with Linkedin in there are other angles to play.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Linkedin is a professional social network, and could counter Facebook for Business<\/strong> &#8212; Facebook has not yet released its business variant, Facebook for Business, but it&#8217;s supposed to roll out this year. Nadella might be trying to get there first by offering a fusion of Linkedin&#8217;s current mix of blogging, social networking, and recruitment use cases with Office 365 productivity options.\u00a0Linking together the professional graph (Linkedin)\u00a0with the work graph\u00a0(Office 365)&#8211; as Nadella <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/06\/14\/business\/dealbook\/microsoft-to-buy-linkedin-for-26-2-billion.html?ref=todayspaper\">talked about in a call with the NY Times<\/a> &#8212; and getting a premium on the integration of the two is probably a smart move so long as the seams can be made low friction. There is a devil in these details, but this is one of the most powerful visions for the merger.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Linkedin alone was a company with real problems<\/strong> &#8212; Linkedin stock got hammered earlier this year after lowered sales estimates. This would be bad in itself but doubly bad for Linkedin, since many of its best and brightest are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/06\/14\/business\/dealbook\/linkedin-stock-based-compensation.html?ref=todayspaper\">compensated in part by stock grants<\/a>, so when the stock falls, so does compensation. As a result, Linkedin was facing a mass exodus unless they could right the boat. This is one of the reasons Microsoft got the terms that it did. And now, people will be compensated in the more standard Microsoft way (as will the accounting for these expenses, which were clouded by non-GAAP practices).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Microsoft sees Linkedin as a way to deflect Slack<\/strong> &#8212; Personally, I don&#8217;t buy this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/articles\/slack-linkedin-and-the-trouble-with-social-networks\">conflation of threats to Microsoft<\/a>. Yes, Slack is making huge inroads in work technology &#8212; specifically as the defining product in the exploding work chat space &#8212; but just because is has some of the features of a &#8216;social network&#8217; (in that people are logged in for long periods of time each day, message each other, can coordinate outside of company boundaries) that doesn&#8217;t mean Slack and Linkedin are in some way head-to-head competitors. Yes, Slack is a competitor to Microsoft&#8217;s productivity\/work technology products &#8212; most specifically Yammer, but also the core functionality slowly growing in Office 365 &#8212; but that doesn&#8217;t mean that Linkedin is intended as a Slack killer. Although Microsoft should be working on that, as well. I just don&#8217;t expect it will come from the Linkedin side of things.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>After all the dust settles I expect that we&#8217;ll see a reoriented Linkedin, with a greater focus on CRM\u00a0technologies and networking, and also a much enlarged focus on people operations (HR) technologies and networking, an area that Microsoft has functionally no offerings. This will take the form of enlarged platforms, and an ecology of partners building on Microsoft\/Linkedin capabilities, as well as other, subsequent acquisitions. And Linkedin will immediately find its operational core &#8212; and culture &#8212; pulled toward CRM and HR\u00a0by the Microsoft sales operation.<\/p>\n<p>I also don&#8217;t believe that Jeff Weiner will be at Microsoft for longer than his required tenure, two years or whatever it is, and\u00a0Kara Swisher <a href=\"http:\/\/www.recode.net\/2016\/6\/13\/11922624\/linkedin-jeff-weiner-microsoft-silicon-valley-will-stay?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTjJSa05EUTBPV1ZqTldNMSIsInQiOiI5NFE2MnEzN0F1RXIwdjc3QmhGckt1ckowWjlvTk9SeFpJWnM0MVgwV0NqOW9LcVFhem4xdWhmTzdJYmQxZUVITkJiZjFYT3Q4eVRyYkZ5SCtcLzlMWW9jY1wvU0t1Z3NjWnRoRlNxOWdsSGFNPSJ9\">agrees<\/a>. More likely he will find new worlds to conquer, and Satya will find someone in Microsoft or Linkedin who will better execute what will rapidly become an integration strategy, rather than a trailblazing one.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Microsoft has stirred up a swirling buzz of discussion around the Linkedin acquisition for $26.2 billion.

Here\u2019s the skinny \u2014 rather than having developers program business processes from scratch, you can use a drag-and-drop tool to create process models. Press play and, hey presto! You have an application.<\/p>\n<p>If you thought you might have heard the ideas around \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/www.forrester.com\/report\/New+Development+Platforms+Emerge+For+CustomerFacing+Applications\/-\/E-RES113411\">low code<\/a>&#8216; before, you would be right. Such ideas have been doing the rounds for as long as I have had the term \u2018analyst\u2019 on my business card, which means going beyond industry analysis, to when I occupied the lowly position of a business analyst in the mid-Nineties.<\/p>\n<p>Even before that I was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.joncollins.net\/wordpress\/tech-publications\/craft-or-science-software-engineering-evolution\/\">writing<\/a> about the prototype-based software development approaches which started to materialise in the mid-Seventies, but which no doubt had their roots long before. But despite the deep desire to yawn vocally in the face of this clear re-hash of old ideas, I remained intrigued. \u201cWhy now?\u201d I thought to myself \u201cWhat\u2019s changed?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>My interest was piqued by the nature of MatsSoft\u2019s arrival on the scene. Software companies form for a number of reasons, for example that someone has spotted a gap in the market and gone cap in hand to the VC\u2019s. More intriguing are those companies that find themselves growing unexpectedly and base their business strategy upon that.<\/p>\n<p>As was the case as process management tools provider MatsSoft. &#8220;As we started to expand, we found we had a really good code base but we were still a body shop, we still needed coders. If we paused and rebuilt, thought to ourselves, we could move beyond that.\u201d Not only did MatsSoft find itself better able to meet its customer needs, it also discovered that customers could do the same for themselves.<\/p>\n<p>So far so good \u2014 but has the company found itself in the front lines of a revolution, or has it merely reached the same epiphany as so many BPM tools providers before them (most of them subsequently bought by Tibco, Oracle, IBM and others)? The answer may well lie in the nature of computing today, and how the boundaries of innovation have moved beyond the IT department and into the lines of business.<\/p>\n<p>This phenomenon has been called many names, not all of which are particularly polite. We talk about Shadow IT, consumerisation or how the CMO is getting a bigger technology budget than the CIO, for better or worse. Fact is that control over technology delivery has fragmented and is never likely to go back to the long-cycle, change request oriented approaches of the past.<\/p>\n<p>Businesses want agility, they want to be able to innovate and move fast, in many cases fearful that if they do not, some upstart will steal their lunch. Mantras such as \u2018fail fast\u2019 or \u2018test and learn\u2019 are an increasing part of boardroom conversations. As such the impetus for technology-based innovation is coming as much from the business, if not more, as from the IT department.<\/p>\n<p>As business use of technology matures, so it makes sense that the tooling the business needs also starts to grow up. Let me put it another way. Back in the day, when I would say to a business user, \u201cYou can do this bit yourself,\u201d they would look at me as if I was mad. These days, the business is doing a number of things for itself, for better or worse, and is increasingly ready to take on the tools it needs to do so.<\/p>\n<p>In consequence, while the tools may not be all that different, the user base is changing. Perhaps lines of business may not do the work themselves, but they can work with providers without having to go through the bottleneck of IT. This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, as IT\u2019s role itself moves to being platform curator rather than keeper of the keys for all things tech-related.<\/p>\n<p>The overall result is less cost, and therefore more opportunity to use tools that help smooth the activities of the business. \u201cYou can automate and standardise things that would not previously be dealt with because it was too expensive,\u201d says Martin. Sure, this means more productivity, greater efficiency, more innovation, improved customer experience, all the things people say you can get out of process management tools.<\/p>\n<p>More importantly however, is that it puts the business into the driving seat, at a time when the business is looking to drive. Yes, \u2018low code\u2019 might be yet another term to describe a familiar capability, but it is pushing on the door of a far more open and technologically savvy set of business user.<\/p>\n<p>Not only this but, rather than presenting itself as something that can make the organisation more \u2018agile\u2019, the low code model is being offered in response to an organisation asking for increased agility. Of course, many organisations still play lip service to such terms but at least the request is coming from the right place.<\/p>\n<p>For sure, we are not yet at the finishing posts. Such technologies, and our working practices, will continue to evolve but as says Martin, \u201cThere\u2019s no going back &#8211; the die is cast. This is how the businesses we work with are choosing to embrace technology.\u201d As organisations continue to mature, they will need the right tools to be used by the right people, in the business and in IT. If that means re-inventing the wheel or creating new terms to describe old mechanisms once or twice, that\u2019s all good.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I confess to have been a bit cynical when I started the call with Martin Scovell, CEO of software vendor MatsSoft, about&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87746169,"featured_media":950178,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[359256475],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950177"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87746169"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=950177"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950177\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/950178"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=950177"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=950177"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=950177"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":950174,"date":"2016-06-08T08:45:19","date_gmt":"2016-06-08T15:45:19","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=950174"},"modified":"2016-06-08T08:47:23","modified_gmt":"2016-06-08T15:47:23","slug":"work-processing","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/06\/08\/work-processing\/","title":{"rendered":"&#8216;Work Processing&#8217; and the decline of the (Wordish) Document"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;ve been exploring a growing list of web-based tools for the creation and management of what most would call &#8216;documents&#8217; &#8212; assemblages of text, images, lists, embedded video, audio and other media &#8212; but which, are in fact, something quite different than the precursors, like Microsoft Word and Apple Pages documents.<\/p>\n<p>The big shift underlying these new tools is that they are not oriented around printing onto paper, or digital analogues of paper, like PDF. Instead, they take as a given that the creation, management, and sharing of these assemblages of information will take place nearly all the time online, and will be social at the core: coediting, commenting, and sharing are not afterthoughts grafted onto a &#8216;work processing&#8217; architecture.

After all, IT is responsible for making sure end users are able to complete their digital tasks. Yet, the ideologies behind service management have change very little over the decades, amounting to a concept where an end user reports a problem, the resolution of that problem is then escalated through a variety of mechanisms, until it is hopefully resolved.<\/p>\n<p>While in theory, the process of servicing end users works acceptably in the enterprise, the fact remains that the majority of end users are often unhappy with their service experience, a fact illustrated by a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.servicenow.com\/company\/media\/press-room\/state-of-work-2016.html\">recent survey from ServiceNow<\/a>. Further illustrating the lack of satisfaction is the sobering statistic that popular consumer services ranked 103% better on the company\u2019s \u201cService Experience Index\u201d, when compared to workplace services.<\/p>\n<p>That statistic alone should be a clarion call for enterprise to take an in-depth look at their internal service mechanisms. While consumer related services are driven by the metric of customer satisfaction, workplace services are instead judged on success of resolution. In other words, consumer facing companies are looking to keep customers happy, while enterprises are more about completing the check boxes associated with solving a problem.<\/p>\n<p>And therein lies the real problem, the disconnect between satisfaction and issue resolution, which becomes readily apparent when consumer services are compared to in-house services. Now some may wonder why that is a problem at all. After all, consumer facing businesses are looking to improve customer loyalty and garner more sales. It\u2019s an old axiom, a happy customer is a repeat customer.<\/p>\n<p>Enterprises on the other hand, have very little concern for end-user happiness, after all they are dealing with a captive audience. Yet, happiness can be directly correlated to productivity and speeding problem resolutions also boosts productivity. In essence, enterprises need to learn from the successes of customer facing service to improve service management.<\/p>\n<p>ServiceNow\u2019s survey points out some critical differences between successful customer services and what the overall impact is. Case in point, the survey reports:<\/p>\n<p>The Service Experience gap is driven by outdated technologies that sap productivity:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>At work, managers are five times more likely to use email and five times less likely to use a mobile app than for consumer services.<\/li>\n<li>Only 28% of managers use the web or a mobile app to request workplace services, versus 84% for consumer services.<\/li>\n<li>Only 5% of managers tap mobile apps for workplace services.<\/li>\n<li>69% of managers say that manual workplace services leave them less time for strategic initiatives, lower their productivity or cause them stress.<\/li>\n<li>79% say that monitoring email interferes with completing tasks, as they spend an average of four hours a day (three at work and one at home) processing work emails.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Dave Wright, Chief Strategy Office at ServiceNow explains \u201cConsumers live in a Web and mobile world where machine logic does the heavy lifting, speeding their requests and sending alerts on status or when people need to act.\u201d \u00a0Wright added \u201cAt work, firms expect employees to manually push the services forward with email, wasting extra cycles on chasing work status and searching inboxes. Email itself is not the enemy. It\u2019s a symptom of a broken process that waylays corporate productivity.\u201d Wright makes an interesting point, one that clearly shows that email may be the productivity sap of the service process, and that manual tasks add to the overhead of issue resolution.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the resolution to enterprise service strife comes in the form of adopting another methodology that has taken hold in IT departments, and that is the concept of agility. The core offering from an agile process is continuous improvement, something that is sorely needed in the service management experience. Also, agility introduces some other benefits, such as frequent iterations of a solution, driven by end user needs. That said, agile thinking is only one part of the solution.<\/p>\n<p>Enterprises looking to improve the service process should also consider the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increasing the focus on innovations, such as introducing improved tools, including web access, mobile device support and collaboration solutions<\/li>\n<li>Embracing automation: Bring M\/L based solutions into the process to improve service issue escalation and resolution.<\/li>\n<li>Moving away from email: Email has been a stop gap in the services equation and is often inefficient, as well as a productivity such. Specialized tools that offer tracking, collaboration and reporting prove to be a much better way to resolve service related issues.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Simply put, striving to put productivity back into the service management process means that enterprises must learn from the successes of customer facing service paradigms and embrace the change those organizations leveraged to increase satisfaction.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At work, firms expect employees to manually push the services forward with email, wasting extra cycles on chasing work status and searching inboxes. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8020068,"featured_media":950169,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[138974939,1448986],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950168"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8020068"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=950168"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950168\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/950169"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=950168"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=950168"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=950168"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":950163,"date":"2016-06-07T08:28:42","date_gmt":"2016-06-07T15:28:42","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=950163"},"modified":"2016-06-07T10:40:32","modified_gmt":"2016-06-07T17:40:32","slug":"prezi-for-business-moving-out-of-the-auditorium-to-the-meeting","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/06\/07\/prezi-for-business-moving-out-of-the-auditorium-to-the-meeting\/","title":{"rendered":"Prezi Business: Moving out of the Auditorium to the Meeting"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>I had a chance to chat last week with Peter Arvai, the founder and CEO of Prezi, the company behind the &#8216;infinite canvas&#8217; presentation tool of the same name.

The orientation of the tools is to support teams and team members tracking tasks and coordinating task work through social communications.<\/p>\n<p>Planner is one of several task-oriented solutions that Microsoft is working to integrate, including <strong>Wunderlist<\/strong> and <strong>Microsoft Project<\/strong>. Conceptually, this means that users will be able to manage personal tasks (in Wunderlist), team work (in Planner), and to manage project planning (in Microsoft Project), and for these to be integrated in sensible ways. So for example, it might be helpful if I could see my work-related tasks, perhaps created and annotated in Planner, in a mobile Wunderlist app. Or to analyze the cost implications for a shift in personnel in a Planner project within the portfolio of company projects managed in Microsoft Project. That&#8217;s one part of the company&#8217;s long-range vision for Planner and the other tools manipulating task information. But it is going to be a long time before all the kinks and use cases are worked out for that grand vision. And at any rate, ultimately Planner will have to stand on its own, based on how good of a work management tool it is.<\/p>\n<p>And that assessment poses another issue. If Planner requires <strong>Office 365<\/strong> in order to use it &#8212; or even experiment with it &#8212; many prospective users will simply never jump through the hoops to try it out. I have raised that very issue with Microsoft representatives this year, as I was being briefed on the product. My suggestion is that Microsoft should create a standalone version of planner &#8212; at least a web app, if not mobile apps &#8212; so that an individual, team, or company could do an apples-to-apples comparison with <strong>Asana<\/strong>, <strong>Trello<\/strong>, or <strong>Wrike<\/strong>, and not the apples-to-oranges comparison with the umpty-ump boxes in that Office image, above. Also, that is the best way for Planner&#8217;s functionality to improve &#8212; in head-to-head competition &#8212; and not as a captive work management &#8216;capability&#8217; locked into Office 365, relying on its integration with Office email, Outlook, Groups, and other tools.<\/p>\n<p>The following is a condensation of the review of Planner from the in-process <em><strong>2016 Work Management Narrative<\/strong><\/em> (much delayed), that I am authoring.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Planner is based on the well-known<\/span><b> kanban-style, \u2018board\u2019 architectural model,<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and three modes of boards are supported at present: user-defined \u2018buckets\u2019, task assignment to members, and progress. As shown in the screenshot below, there is a left hand column where I have selected a <\/span><b>plan<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, in this case Work Management Narrative, and I chose to display that plan as <\/span><b>Buckets<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, not by <\/span><b>Progress<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><b>Assigned to<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In the \u2018research tools\u2019 bucket there is a single task, \u2018research Microsoft Planner\u2019, which shows icons indicating 0 of 2 subtasks have been completed, that there are comments, and the task has been assigned to Stowe Boyd. The half moon icon indicates that the task is in progress, a third state for tasks: unstarted, in progress, and completed.<\/span><\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-26-at-5.27.27-PM.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-950160\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-26-at-5.27.27-PM-680x321.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-03-26 at 5.27.27 PM\" width=\"680\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-26-at-5.27.27-PM-680x321.png 680w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-26-at-5.27.27-PM-300x141.png 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-26-at-5.27.27-PM-768x362.png 768w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-26-at-5.27.27-PM-968x456.png 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-26-at-5.27.27-PM-210x99.png 210w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-26-at-5.27.27-PM-53x25.png 53w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-26-at-5.27.27-PM-106x50.png 106w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-26-at-5.27.27-PM-320x151.png 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-26-at-5.27.27-PM-640x302.png 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-26-at-5.27.27-PM-804x379.png 804w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-26-at-5.27.27-PM.png 1143w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/a>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clicking on \u2018write method section\u2019 expands that task (or, in the usual terminology, turns over the \u2018card\u2019), as we see in the screenshot below.

Groups support group-oriented communications, but those are not accessed in the Planner section of Office 365.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I believe that Planner users will find the need to return to Outlook to conduct conversations about their projects annoying, as opposed to the more normal model of an in-context &#8212; or best, in-project &#8212; activity stream. <strong>I bet that Microsoft will hear this as a frequent suggestion for additional Planner functionality<\/strong>. However, I often operate in multiple windows on the same project workspace, and so, having a conversation window and a Planner board view open at the same time is really not very different, and may be workable for many. Note also that if Microsoft builds a standalone version of Planner there will be no Outlook to lean upon, so an in-context activity stream or chat model would be best.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office 365 users are likely using the spectrum of features &#8212; Outlook, OneDrive, Office apps, Groups, OneNote, and Planner &#8212; and therefore will rapidly habituate to transiting the many loosely integrated components, and will likely adapt to a model of use involving a lot of moving around.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By itself, <\/span><b>Planner would only be considered a team task management tool, not a true work management tool<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, since it lacks activity streams, @mentions, and other baseline social communications. However, that&#8217;s a red herring, since Planner &#8212; at present &#8212; is never without Groups and Outlook, and can\u2019t be separated from them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At present, I think the initial implementation of <strong>charts<\/strong> is a better indicator of where Planner is headed. In the screenshot below\u00a0I\u2019ve pulled an example from the Microsoft website (since my examples aren\u2019t rich enough), and this shows the ease of quickly grasping the status of a Planner \u2018document\u2019 through a dashboard view.<\/span><\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/charts-planner.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-950162\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/charts-planner-680x342.png\" alt=\"charts planner\" width=\"680\" height=\"342\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/charts-planner-680x342.png 680w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/charts-planner-300x151.png 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/charts-planner-768x386.png 768w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/charts-planner-968x486.png 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/charts-planner-210x106.png 210w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/charts-planner-50x25.png 50w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/charts-planner-100x50.png 100w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/charts-planner-320x161.png 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/charts-planner-640x322.png 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/charts-planner-804x404.png 804w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/06\/charts-planner.png 1246w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/a>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also want to give a nod to the designers of Planner for including <\/span><b>the three state model for task status: not started, in progress, and completed<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

If you\u2019re feeling like you\u2019ve heard it all before, you probably have. Top of the list of topics is that\u00a0the \u2018things\u2019 themselves are going to be insecure. They\u2019re running operating systems and software, neither of which may have been considered with security in mind.<\/p>\n<p>The consequence is a massive increase in what security pros know as the \u2018attack surface\u2019, that is, the scope of stuff that can be targeted by malicious hackers, fraudsters or other nondescripts. The resulting challenge is very real, particularly given the personal nature of information being captured \u2014 from heart rates to locations \u2014 and its potential for misuse.<\/p>\n<p>In the spirit of a brainstorm, let\u2019s make an assumption however: that there is nothing we can do about it. The genie is well and truly out of the bottle, let us say, and our every movement and behaviour can and will be logged for personal, commercial and <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2016\/05\/05\/solving-government-security-it-issues\/\">governmental<\/a> purposes. While we may benefit, we also may need to live with the security risks.<\/p>\n<p>This ultra-transparent scenario may not become the case, but even if it doesn\u2019t, there will be situations that make it seem that way.\u00a0What is more, the devices that we rely upon will inevitably become both smarter, and more susceptible to attack. We need to face up to our complicity in this: who thinks about data security before buying a fitness device, for example?<\/p>\n<p>By seeing such risks as read, we can bank them and move on to other areas of concern. The above covers data, but in its most granular sense \u2014 facts about individuals, or login details, are a risk in themselves.\u00a0But there\u2019s a deeper level \u2014 that the data is open to manipulation.<\/p>\n<p>For sure, insurers may refuse to cover an individual whose fitness device shows the occasional heart flutter. But what if the data stream itself is modified, through malice or through incompetence, such that numerous heart rates incorrectly indicate a flutter?<\/p>\n<p>Some have speculated about the potential to modify agricultural data as a way of\u00a0manipulating futures markets. Equally,\u00a0a home automation company could rig your systems so it made more money \u2014 for example, turning on the heating for 29 seconds extra every day. Not a figure to register on one thermostat, but one that would ring up a large amount of small change.<\/p>\n<p>So, not only do we need mechanisms to protect the confidentiality of our data, based on the same assumption that the bad thing is reasonably likely to happen, we also need to consider how to prove that the data is valid.<\/p>\n<p>One possibility is to make every single sensor reading linked to a security key, but the phrase sledgehammer and nut springs to mind. Equally, the scale of the solution would be too costly to be achievable.<\/p>\n<p>Is there an answer? Yes indeed, and it\u00a0lies in taking a leaf from the works of the Jericho Forum, that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.opengroup.org\/jericho\/index.htm\">body<\/a> of Chief Information Security Officers founded in 2002 and disbanded a decade later, when the group deemed its work on &#8216;de-perimeterisation\u2019 to be complete.\u00a0Complete? Really? How could information security ever be complete?<\/p>\n<p>The CISOs realised that they needed to manage data wherever it was, rather than trying to keep it in one place \u2014 and to do so, they needed a way to identify who, or what, was creating or accessing it.\u00a0In November 2010 they announced the Identity and Access Management <a href=\"https:\/\/collaboration.opengroup.org\/jericho\/Jericho%20Forum%20Identity%20Commandments%20v1.0.pdf\">Commandments<\/a>, a set of design principles technologies need to adopt.<\/p>\n<p>This finding \u2014 that identity needs to be present \u2014 is profound. A corollary principle has been adopted by Google in its Beyond Corp initiative for its internal systems, which treats networks as insecure and instead, enables data access based on being able to identify the device, and the person, making the access request.<\/p>\n<p>We could take this insight one step further. That data which cannot prove its provenance (i.e. from an identifiable person or device) could, or even should be treated as invalid. The notion of security by design is a start, but perhaps it will only be through identity by design that we can architect the Internet of Things to be both transparent and trusted.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s inevitable, isn\u2019t it, that the security industry should be all over the Internet of Things.

What\u2019s worse, managers often report that Millennials tend to be unaware of gaps in these basic skills and are completely unconcerned about it. In response to this gap in skills, some managers just get frustrated. After all, when Millennials come to the workplace, shouldn\u2019t they already be mature enough to arrive on time, dress appropriately, practice good manners, stay focused on their key tasks, and do lots of work very well at a good, steady pace? Should managers be expected to teach them these sorts of things? As a restaurant manager put it, \u201cNobody taught me how to wipe my nose in my jobs. I had to learn how to manage myself.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That may be. But if you are the boss, then this gap in skills is your problem. If you manage Millennials who lack some of the basics of self-management, I\u2019m sure you are frustrated too. Here\u2019s what you need to do: Help them. Lift them up. Make them better. Teach them to care about the basics. Teach them to be more aware of those gaps in their repertoires. Teach them to fill those gaps, one at a time. Teach them how to manage themselves.<\/p>\n<h3>1) Help Them Set Priorities<\/h3>\n<p>Setting priorities is usually step one in most time management programs and seminars. If you have limited time and too much to do, then you need to set priorities\u2014an order of precedence or preference\u2014so that you control what gets done first, second, third, and so on. That setting priorities is the key to time management is obvious to most professionals. The hard part is teaching Millennials how to set priorities.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to big-picture priorities, set clear priorities with Millennials, and communicate those priorities relentlessly. Make sure your Millennials are devoting the lion\u2019s share of their time to first and second priorities. When it comes to setting day-to-day priorities, teach Millennials how by setting priorities together with them. Let them know your thinking process. Walk through it with them: \u201cThis is first priority because X. This is second priority because Y. This is low priority because Z.\u201d Over time, you hope they learn. Until they learn, you have to keep making decisions for them. Teach Millennials to postpone low-priority activities until high-priority activities are well ahead of schedule. Those are the time windows during which lower-priority activities can be accomplished, starting with the top lower priorities, of course.<\/p>\n<h3>2) Help Them Eliminate Time Wasters<\/h3>\n<p>Remember that Millennials treasure time above all other nonfinancial rewards. When you help them eliminate time wasters and limit the time they spend on low priorities, you are helping them focus their time on top priorities and giving them free time they otherwise would have wasted. That is a reward that keeps on giving. They\u2019ll really appreciate it.<\/p>\n<p>When helping Millennials identify time wasters to eliminate, don\u2019t mistake distractions for time wasters. They may or not be. Remember that Millennials are used to multitasking\u2014they\u2019ve been doing their homework for years with an MP3 player in one ear and a cell phone buzzing text messages on the table. Just because it might be distracting to you doesn\u2019t mean it is distracting to them. If the task in question is being performed well within expected time frames, then the employee is probably not distracted. Pay attention to which of the so-called distractions help them remain absorbed in their tasks at work as opposed to those that draw their attention away.<\/p>\n<h3>3) Teach the Habits of Critical Thinking<\/h3>\n<p>Managers often tell us that the biggest constraint on maximizing young workers is their lack of seasoned judgment.<\/p>\n<p>What is good judgment anyway? It\u2019s not the same thing as sheer brain power, mental capacity, or natural intelligence. It\u2019s not a matter of accumulated knowledge or memorized information. It is more than the mastery of techniques and tools. In very simple terms, good judgment is the ability to see the connection between causes and their effects.<\/p>\n<p>Teach Millennials to be strategic by using decision\/action trees every step of the way. Teach them to think ahead and play out the likely sequence of moves and countermoves before making a move: \u201cIf you take this decision or action, who is likely to respond, how, when, where, and why? What set of options will this create? What set of options will this cut off? How will it play out if you take this other decision\/action instead?<\/p>\n<p>The senior executive of a media company asked, \u201cHow does a person learn real-life lessons faster than he can experience real life? Is there any way to jump-start this process?\u201d One way is to learn from the life experiences of others or from history. This is why the case study method is used by most business schools. Real company cases are presented to students in detail. Who were the key players? What were their interests and objectives? What happened? How did it happen? Where? When? What were the outcomes? Students are then taught to apply the methods of critical thinking to the facts of the case. They are taught to suspend judgment, question assumptions, uncover the facts, and then rigorously analyze the decisions and actions taken by different key players in the case study. The pedagogy is simple: look at the outcomes, and trace them back to see the chains of cause and effect.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>About the Author<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Bruce Tulgan is an adviser to business leaders all over the world and a sought-after keynote speaker and seminar leader.

That means that first truly native ecommerce generation is now in charge of their own foot traffic and armed with at least one device that spares them the trouble of leaving the house. This, paired with the broader shift in consumer behavior across all generations, means brick and mortars need to find new ways to compete with digital to inspire visits and sales. Stores are evolving and, along the way, challenging the very notion of what a store is for.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Up against digital<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A big part of brick and mortar\u2019s evolution is digital integration. Today, retailers are working to enhance and personalize customer experience by connecting to consumers in-store through their mobile devices\u2014building apps, targeting ads, and using <a href=\"http:\/\/performancein.com\/news\/2016\/04\/29\/ibeacons-elevating-customer-experience-barneys\/\">beacons<\/a>. You can find many examples of digital integration today, though online retailer Rebecca Minkoff\u2019s flagship store in New York offers one of the more comprehensive ones; its interactive wall and dressing rooms have been credited with <a href=\"http:\/\/digiday.com\/brands\/rebecca-minkoff-digital-store\/\">tripling expected clothing sales<\/a>. <a href=\"http:\/\/digiday.com\/brands\/timberland-creates-first-digitally-connected-store\/\">Timberland<\/a> also just launched its first connected store while Nordstrom\u2019s commitment to digital integration has been credited with <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2015\/01\/why-nordstroms-digital-strategy-works-and-yours-probably-doesnt\">50% growth in revenue over 5 years<\/a>. (They just hired a former <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cio.com\/article\/3051052\/hiring\/nordstrom-cio-hires-former-amazon-exec-as-cto.html\">Amazon exec<\/a> to serve as CTO.) Target, too, is getting into the mix, launching an <a href=\"https:\/\/corporate.target.com\/article\/2015\/09\/la25-announcement\">LA25 initiative<\/a> where it\u2019s testing 50 of its top enhancements in 25 Los Angeles stores.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The IRL advantage<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>But digital integration is not the only strategy; retailers can also draw on the in-real-life [IRL] advantages of the physical space. Immediacy comes in here, with more retailers enabling online ordering and pick up in store or curbside. It\u2019s competitive because fewer exclusively online retailers can offer this instant gratification, but is not necessarily a long-term strategy given that online fulfillment will continue to evolve and speed up.<\/p>\n<p>More effective is the opportunity to build community. Oftentimes, this comes in the form of caffeine; Barnes and Noble was an early innovator here, adding a Starbucks to a New Jersey store back in 1993. Since then, many retailers have adopted or tested in-store cafes, including Urban Outfitters, Target, Restoration Hardware, and Kohl\u2019s. Along the same lines, Target, Whole Foods, and Nordstrom, among others, are offering cocktails in some stores. When trying to attract customers and increase dwell time, there\u2019s an advantage in offering something that can\u2019t be instantly downloaded, like coffee, booze, and yes, maybe even tattoos. (See <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2016-02-11\/whole-foods-365-stores-may-let-company-challenge-trader-joe-s\">Whole Foods.)<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, another concept that keeps popping up is\u2014ahem\u2014the pop up shop. The pop up shop\u2019s currency is urgency; if customers don\u2019t come <em>now<\/em> they risk missing out forever. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/life\/entertainthis\/2016\/04\/12\/hamilton-musical-broadway-bloomingdales-pop-up-store-new-york\/82933052\/\">Bloomingdales is hosting a pop up<\/a> inspired by the musical <em>Hamilton <\/em>while Macy\u2019s is bringing in pop ups as part of the reinvention of its Brooklyn store. The pop up also presents a low-risk testing ground for online retailers, one compelling example being Warby Parker\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.warbyparker.com\/retail\/austin\/513-w-6th-st\">touring store that was housed in a school bus.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>But&#8230;is it a store?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As brick and mortar adapts, becoming deeper integrated with digital, acting a fulfillment center and expanding to offer drinks and other services, the classic definition of \u201cstore\u201d begins to fragment. Already, the \u201cstore\u201d has lost its longstanding position as the finale of the customer purchase funnel; in no small part because that purchase funnel itself is an antiquated concept. Savvy retailers and brands in general now think of the consumer experience as an ongoing loop, with consumers moving from digital to physical and back until, eventually, there may be no clear delineation between the two. This emphasis on the overall experience changes the expectations of stores. It also opens opportunities for more types of brands to invest in physical locations.<\/p>\n<p>For example, last year, there was an more than an hour wait at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fastcocreate.com\/3053990\/indulge-in-your-feels-at-glades-museum-of-feelings\">Museum of Feelings<\/a> in downtown New York City. The museum invited visitors to walk through a sensory presentation of each feeling: Optimism, Joy, Invigorated, Exhilarated and Calm, while its exterior changed color to reflect the social mood of New York. You might argue that this wasn\u2019t actually a store, but then it wasn\u2019t actually a museum either; The Museum of Feelings was a branded retail experience for Glade, generating buzz for an otherwise not-so-buzzed-about brand.<\/p>\n<p>More recently, Samsung launched <a href=\"https:\/\/news.samsung.com\/global\/samsung-837-opens-its-doors-in-the-heart-of-nyc-marking-the-first-of-its-kind-cultural-destination-digital-playground-and-marketing-center-of-excellence\">Samsung 837<\/a>, a \u201cfirst-its-kind cultural destination, digital playground and marketing center of excellence.\u201d Samsung 837 serves as a showcase for innovation, offering what may be the first virtual reality experience for many visitors and providing Instagram-friendly experiences like the walk-through Social Media Gallery. But what\u2019s unique about Samsung\u2019s space is that there is nothing sold there. It\u2019s an experience\u2014an opportunity for Samsung to tell its story and give visitors a way to get excited about the brand they\u2019ll buy in the future.<\/p>\n<p>In cases like these, brick and mortars serve as a marketing vehicle\u2014an opportunity for brands to curate their own presence for customers, just as social provided the format to operate as a media company. It\u2019s a trend that makes <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/amazon-plans-hundreds-of-brick-and-mortar-bookstores-mall-ceo-says-1454449475\">Amazon\u2019s decision<\/a> to open its own brick and mortars seem strategic. But is the return there?<\/p>\n<p><strong>It always comes back to data<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The ability to more accurately track consumer activity gives brick and mortars a host of insights. Not only can the more connected store know what was purchased, they can also see what products compelled the most research, price comparisons, or inspired trips to the fitting room. They can engage with in-store customers via social media as well as encourage and measure posts from their store and, increasingly, tap into <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/03\/29\/tech-goes-emo\/\">emotional analytics<\/a>. Further, more sophisticated attribution measurement is making it possible to determine what investments drove traffic to the store, even without purchase.<\/p>\n<p>Though it would be inaccurate to suggest that traffic and sales aren\u2019t still the key performance indicators for most stores, this broader set of data, if put to use, can help a retailer optimize beyond the limits of its four walls\u2014especially critical at a time when stores are closing so rapidly that CNN wrote \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2016\/02\/25\/investing\/struggling-retailers-sears-best-buy-kohls-store-closings\/\">Store Closings are the Hottest Trend in Retail<\/a>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where to go from here<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Digital has an odd way of creating challenges and then presenting solutions for those challenges it creates.

None the less, the current layers of security fail at times, often due to a single vendor approach to creating those layers of security.<\/p>\n<p>Naturally, vendors are not all to blame, except for the fact that a lack of collaboration and technology transfer among those security vendors effectively creates silos of protection, regardless of the number of layers installed. For example, a single vendor solution that incorporates firewall, AV, IDP, Malware detection, and other elements into a singular platform using multiple detection layers may allow attacks to slip by simply because the threat has been designed to bypass the protection offered by that single vendor solution.<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, the threats of today are larger than any one vendor, meaning that the isolation of security technology must become a thing of the past. In other words, it may \u201ctake a village\u201d to raise security standards to combat the threats of today and tomorrow.<\/p>\n<p>However, the winds of change are blowing and many security vendors are coming to the realization that sharing security practices and the associated technology can benefit all, except for the cybercriminals. Case in point is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dbnetworks.com\/\">DB Networks<\/a>, a vendor whose products I have <a href=\"http:\/\/www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com\/netsecur\/dbnetworks-brings-intelligence-to-sql-injection-protection.html\">reviewed<\/a> in the past. DB Networks is now turning their competitors into partners by licensing the company\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dbnetworks.com\/products\/Layer-7-Databse-Sensor.htm\">Layer 7 Database Sensor<\/a>, so that other security vendors can include advanced machine learning into their own security products.<\/p>\n<p>By allowing what were once competitors to incorporate DB Network\u2019s proprietary security technologies, DB Networks has helped to create a collaborative security environment, where multi-vendor security products can work in unison, yet still provide specific layers of protection. \u00a0This differs vastly from the licensing schemes used by AV vendors in the past, simply because those AV vendors were not offering full integration into another vendor\u2019s security product, but were acting as an independent layer as part of the overall security process.<\/p>\n<p>The Layer 7 Database Sensor differs greatly in both concept and execution. From the outset, the DB Networks Layer 7 Database Sensor was designed to be integrated into partners\u2019 security products, which then allowed the partner to provide their end customers with full-spectrum visibility across all attack surfaces. For the most part, the product integration brings with it the ability to discover databases and connected applications, while also identifying traffic to\/from restricted segments, which allows the product to pinpoint compromised credentials.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, the Layer 7 Database Sensor brings with it the ability to immediately identify database attacks using machine learning and behavioral analysis. Ultimately, the integration of the capabilities offered allows security vendors to create more robust security products, which are able to use multiple layers of threat identification to leverage numerous technologies in the fight to block even the most advanced attacks.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Simply put, the threats of today are larger than any one vendor, meaning that the isolation of security technology must become a thing of the past.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8020068,"featured_media":168644,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[231408,256016308,359256425,359236721],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950095"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8020068"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=950095"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950095\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/168644"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=950095"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=950095"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=950095"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":950094,"date":"2016-05-18T09:38:59","date_gmt":"2016-05-18T16:38:59","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=950094"},"modified":"2016-07-01T08:37:33","modified_gmt":"2016-07-01T15:37:33","slug":"explore-ai-at-gigaom-change-in-austin-this-september","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/05\/18\/explore-ai-at-gigaom-change-in-austin-this-september\/","title":{"rendered":"Explore AI at Gigaom Change in Austin this September"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>The idea of artificial intelligence is an old one.

However, some businesses can&#8217;t justify the cost of implementing and managing a dedicated help desk to serve the demands of their end users due to a lack of available IT resources or budgetary constraints. This creates a unique challenge: end users need access to support for productivity, yet a fully staffed help desk is out of the question.<\/p>\n<p>Solving the conundrum involves finding a balance between supporting users and reining in costs, without either spiraling out of control. Still, businesses lacking an IT support mechanism will encounter productivity-sapping problems, which may not have any easy solutions, forcing them to employ their very best creative problem-solving skills.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Building a help desk<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Most businesses start by relying on vendors to provide help when problems strike, but vendors tend to be limited when offering free support for their own products and may require the purchase of a support plan. While the initial cost may not seem daunting, the complex, hybrid networks in use today require more than a single vendor and product support plan to keep end users productive.<\/p>\n<p>Creating a help desk for internal and external staffers should not be an insurmountable challenge. There are myriad options available, ranging from cloud-based contracted services and <a href=\"http:\/\/thepulseofit.com\/en-us\/article\/how-smb-channel-partners-can-overcome-obstacles-through-collaboration\">value-added reseller<\/a> (VAR) provided solutions to internally deployed hardware and software. Regardless of the path chosen, every help desk solution should contain three critical elements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Staff:<\/strong> Someone has to man the help desk and be ready to answer phone calls, emails, or other end user requests for service and additional help.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Platform:<\/strong> A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zendesk.com\/resources\/6-tips-for-building-a-thriving-help-center\/\">tracking system<\/a> should be set up to support the creation of troubleshooting tickets and document interactions between help desk staffers and users requesting support.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Remediation:<\/strong> A mechanism should be in place to assist help desk staffers in remediating the reported problem(s).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Normally, these three requirements are met by deploying a help desk system, which is a combination of hardware and software tools supporting the overall mission. Many hardware vendors include elements to ease the adoption of help desk techniques.<\/p>\n<p>In many cases, those additional capabilities can reduce the overall support costs and speed resolution times. For example, some hardware vendors offer remote boot, remote control, and other features that make it easier for a technician to connect to a problem system and resolve any issues. Some vendors also offer software clients and hardware capabilities to simply and smoothly integrate their products into a help desk platform.<\/p>\n<h4>Affordable alternatives and solutions<\/h4>\n<p>You may also choose to go the open source route to create an internal help desk. There are several free options available that provide a decent starting point. For businesses seeking more information, <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.capterra.com\/the-7-best-free-help-desk-software-tools\/\">Capterra<\/a> offers insight into some popular free tools, such as UserVoice, Freshdesk, and osTicket.<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, there is a lot more to deploying a successful IT help desk than just selecting support software. You&#8217;ll need to take into account the situations where help requests may arise and how critical it is to solve those problems before productivity is impacted, much of which can be accomplished by adopting some industry standard best practices, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement a web-based knowledge base tool.<\/li>\n<li>Use the help desk software system to increase communications with agents and customers.<\/li>\n<li>Make a customer self-help portal accessible 24 hours every day.<\/li>\n<li>Install service request automation processes in your help desk software.<\/li>\n<li>Utilize real-time help desk reports, dashboards, metrics, and analytics.<\/li>\n<li>Institute an asset management system and integrate it with the help desk software system.<\/li>\n<li>Apply a change management system.<\/li>\n<li>Perform customer satisfaction surveys on a regular basis.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Following these steps can lead to a successful help desk system, and soon, you&#8217;ll be able to leverage the technology and services, receive all the benefits, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www8.hp.com\/us\/en\/business-solutions\/smb\/uptime.html\">keep your business running<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Return on investment<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>One of the most important issues surrounding a help desk is affordability. Many businesses tend to focus on the cost of the hardware, software, and staff needed for an effective help desk to determine operational costs, yet those same companies fail to realize the value offered by a help desk, which can be simply measured by increased productivity. The quicker problems are solved, the quicker staffers return to productivity.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also a good idea to keep tabs on help desk operations in the form of reports. By evaluating the number of problems, the time to resolution, and the return to productivity, company operators can discover how much a help desk contributes to overall productivity, thereby justifying the expenses involved.<\/p>\n<p>Unifying help desk and system management solutions can revolutionize your business&#8217;s service desk options and inventory control, and when your business starts to grow, you&#8217;ll be glad you didn&#8217;t overlook the importance of having a stable IT help desk.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>An IT help desk is often the first line of support for many organizations.

Triathletes say it has all the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dcrainmaker.com\/2015\/03\/garmin-fenix3-detailed-review.html\">right stuff<\/a> for their demanding regimens. <\/p>\n<p>But what if you\u2019re not a hardcore athlete?

There are dozens of features, but these are what I consider the main things most people will do with the watch:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Track and analyze your activity.<\/strong><br \/>\nTrack basic bio data (steps, sleep patterns, heart rate, and estimated calorie burn) in addition to runs, bikes or swims. The accumulated data syncs to your computer or phone where you can analyze it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Go exploring (without getting lost).<\/strong><br \/>\nSuper-accurate GPS (plus compass, altimeter and barometer) assists you on runs, climbs, rides, trails or hikes. Plan your routes with free Basecamp software (buy maps or upload your own tracks). Navigate and record your progress. Reverse your path to be guided back the way you came.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Get to know your running form.<\/strong><br \/>\nWith the f\u0113nix 3 HR you can track a number of informative \u2018running dynamics\u2019 without a heart rate band, all the tracking is done at your wrist. See heart rate, steps per minute (cadence), ground contact time and left\/right balance, stride length, and vertical oscillation (how high you bounce off the ground). <\/p>\n<p><strong>Do guided workouts and training.<\/strong><br \/>\nCreate custom workouts or download pre-programmed ones. Follow along through the steps as they appear on the watch. Set training targets based on distance, time and speed. Get real-time progress feedback.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Customize and expand.<\/strong><br \/>\nAdd different watch faces (essentially display themes) and data fields. Download widgets and apps. For example, there\u2019s a golf rangefinder app, a speedometer, gym timer, atlas, etc. These add-ons make this a \u2018smart\u2019 watch in a way that will seem familiar in the era of customizable devices.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Leave it on (and still look good).<\/strong><br \/>\nThe term \u2018Multisport GPS Smartwatch\u2019 may evoke visions of a chunky watch with an antennae, but stylish good looks were clearly a priority here. It certainly doesn\u2019t look like a fitness bracelet, and I think you could wear it confidently to work or on a date.

In that case, the question was on the money: as intervening history has shown, the term was poorly defined, easily abused by gung-ho marketers and in general, made explanations more complicated rather than simpler.<\/p>\n<p>So such scepticism is as understandable as it is, in the case of digital, misplaced. Over the past 3-4 years since the term started being thrown about once again, what has become clear is that \u2018digital&#8217; is a business-led, not an IT-led initiative.<\/p>\n<p>At its heart is a simple principle: that technologically enabled data flows are now everywhere, connecting everything that can be connected. There are no boundaries to reach, nor to innovation, nor to privacy.<\/p>\n<p>This is fundamentally different to old-world use of technology, where data was over there, to be managed by an IT department and protected with firewalls. It is notable that Google has removed the latter, with its Beyond Corp\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.usenix.org\/conference\/lisa13\/enterprise-architecture-beyond-perimeter\">initiative<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Which brings to the point. It\u2019s an old joke in the title, I know, but it seemed appropriate to roll it out. \u2018Digital\u2019 is a state of mind that needs to exist at board level. Either an organisation acts like data is everywhere, or like it is over there.\u00a0It\u2019s the difference between being a digital native, or, well, not being so.<\/p>\n<p>Businesses know this, and in many cases are restructuring to take the shift into account. The term being bandied around is \u2018digital transformation\u2019, or that horrible word, digitalisation.<\/p>\n<p>But let\u2019s be clear. This is not some journey to be started upon never to be completed, nor an initiative to be piloted to see what works.<\/p>\n<p>If you want an example of a major company that &#8216;gets it\u2019, look no further than GE. Since I started speaking to the company a few years ago, it has gone from an organisation that recognised the need to change, through an organisation embracing change, to an organisation being that change.<\/p>\n<p>The journey started, and ended, at the very\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2016-02-29\/ge-sees-15-billion-in-software-sales-in-digital-transformation\">top<\/a>.\u00a0I met with\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/harelk\">Harel Kodesh<\/a>\u00a0CTO of GE Digital at the end of last year, and we had a good conversation as one would hope. More interesting than what was discussed, was the way in which it was discussed however.<\/p>\n<p>Right now however the organisation is already making its bets as a digital organisation, for example with its digital twins or\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.predix.com\/\">Predix<\/a>\u00a0platform initiatives. It is an organisation without any doubt in its mind about strategy or direction. It is all-in on digital.<\/p>\n<p>Of course such efforts might fail, business was ever thus. Someone else might steal GE\u2019s lunch, or the company might make bad decisions. But nobody can doubt the organisation\u2019s clarity over that single question: what is digital?<\/p>\n<p>I doubt anyone inside the organisation still cares, as they are too busy.<\/p>\n<p>The fact is, if you have to ask the question, you probably have a way to go. In the digital world, we need to think like children, break away from our legacy understanding of where technology sits, and accept the fact that it has changed from without to within.<\/p>\n<p>Understand this, simple yet profound truth, and you can return to the field and set a strategy accordingly. Fail to do so and be doomed to pondering the question, long after\u00a0those who have answered it are already gone.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Over the past few days and weeks, a recurring mantra has appeared in conversations I have had, or overheard, with clients. \u201cWell,&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87746169,"featured_media":950076,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[359256451,359215936],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950075"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87746169"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=950075"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950075\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/950076"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=950075"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=950075"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=950075"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":950070,"date":"2016-05-10T08:26:25","date_gmt":"2016-05-10T15:26:25","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=950070"},"modified":"2016-05-11T13:08:51","modified_gmt":"2016-05-11T20:08:51","slug":"the-next-opportunity-for-wearable-technologies-aesthetics","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/05\/10\/the-next-opportunity-for-wearable-technologies-aesthetics\/","title":{"rendered":"The next opportunity for wearable technologies: aesthetics"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Many of us have seen both the hype around wearables as well as the growing number of critiques of the hype. But one thing is clear: what we see in the market now is just the beginning, a warm up band for the main act to follow.<\/p>\n<p>In my previous post I discussed the problem of sustainable use of tracking devices and how consumers abandon them within months typically. But is the battle for the wrist and smartwatches really the future of wearable technology? Why the wrist and why do products designed for the wrist and marketed for their aesthetics such as the Fitbit Alta fail to impress from a design perspective?<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, could user experience be wrapped up with aesthetics and could this be an important factor even for medical devices? Of course it is. We need only go back nearly a decade to find examples of how aesthetics were used to rethink wearable technology. It might be time to re-visit the past to see the future.<\/p>\n<p>Nearly a decade ago, diabetes blogger Amy Tenderich posted a blog bemoaning the fact that diabetics needed their own Steve Jobs to re-design the insulin pump. The device worn by many diabetics to manage insulin levels was viewed as a clunky medical device devoid of any aesthetic considerations. Functionality trumped aesthetics. But sick people, or those struggling with chronic diseases and\/or aging, do care about aesthetics, especially if they have the device on the body.<\/p>\n<p>A design firm in San Francisco discovered the blog post and within a short time re-designed an insulin pump that could make diabetics feel better about wearing the device. We hear a lot about patient engagement these days and in this context, aesthetics mean a lot.<\/p>\n<p>Devices are not solely about data and the data are not the only dimensions of disease or wellness. These can become aspects of identities. \u00a0To illustrate the case, a similar design effort was sponsored by the UK Design Council over a decade ago to rethink the hearing aid and create \u201chear ware\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>At the time, \u2018Hearing Aids\u2019 were viewed as stigmatized and associated with the aging body. Introducing an aesthetic component helped designers to re-imagine hearing devices well beyond the hearing aid, to address hearing challenges we all face, such as being in a noisy restaurant or when exposed to noise pollution. The competition featured in the Victoria and Albert Museum featured devices resembling jewelry with a wider range of functions.<\/p>\n<p>Now enter Amanda Parkes, a New York-based technologist\/designer with a PhD from MIT\u2019s Media Lab. Notice as well, the location: New York, the heart of high fashion in the US. Famous for her invocation, \u201cLet Silicon Valley have the wrist, I\u2019ll take the body\u201d, Amanda is deep into re-imagining wearables from both a fashion perspective and materials design. From smart fibers to fiber batteries and bio-materials, she is rethinking the whole concept of the wearable from an aesthetic angle and materials. Wearables, meet Bauhaus design principles.<\/p>\n<p>When we look at what is going on in the labs these days, with sensors in the form of tattoos that can detect ever more powerful biometric indications, we need to begin thinking about the body as an interface. Many of these sensors will be invisible. They may be connected to your mobile money application as well.<\/p>\n<p>When the novelty of wearing a shrunken iPhone on the wrist wears off, there is much more work to be done from an innovation standpoint. Parkes makes the case for diversity, as many in the tech sector do these days, but for rethinking form, function and appearance.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps in no other sector will diversity in design from an age, gender, ethnicity, you name it subjectivity; aesthetics follows broader cultural norms and trends. And this matters in healthcare too. I\u2019m betting the next generation of market leaders in this sector will grasp this, and in doing so will find themselves pushing on an open door. Aesthetics matters for the afflicted as much for the well, if not more so.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Interested in learning about the evolution of wearables health technology?

It is excerpted from <\/i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1119190754\/\"><span class=\"s2\"><i>Not Everyone Gets a Trophy: How to Manage the Millennials<\/i><\/span><\/a> by <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/contributor\/bruce-tulgan\/\"><span class=\"s2\">Bruce Tulgan<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>1) Care About Your Millennials<\/h3>\n<p>When I say, \u201ccare about your employees,\u201d I\u2019m not saying you need to love your employees as if they really are your own children or let them come live in your basement. But you may need to usher them through these early stages of their working life and into the next. Help them make the transition.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t be alarmed. You don\u2019t need to relate to this person\u2019s deep inside thoughts, feelings and spirit, or even inner motives. In my view, you shouldn\u2019t even try unless you are a trained therapist or pastor. Just care enough to help this person succeed at work, at least whenever this person is working for you. One Millennial recently told me, \u201cI need to work for people who know who I am and what I\u2019m doing, and who seem to care. I\u2019ve had bosses who didn\u2019t even know my name. But right now I\u2019m working for this woman who is very busy, but she really connects with me, eye-to-eye kind of, asks me questions and really listens. She\u2019s taught me a lot already.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>2) Don\u2019t Pretend<\/h3>\n<p>Don\u2019t get me wrong. I am not saying you should actually pretend to be a parent to your employees at work. In fact, you shouldn\u2019t pretend anything. Millennials have giant BS detectors, especially around authority figures. You have to be authentic to succeed with them. So focus on the authentic common interest between you two, which is the work at hand, and on playing very well the real role you have in their working lives: that of a manager.<\/p>\n<p>You are running a workplace. The relationships at work are transactional relationships. I promise you, none of your employees would be showing up to work every day if you were not paying them. So treat each person and the relationship with respect. But don\u2019t hesitate to take charge and tell them what to do. You are paying them to work very well, very fast, all day long. Make that fact explicit, keep a spotlight on it, and never try to camouflage it.<\/p>\n<h3>3) Give Them Boundaries<\/h3>\n<p>The Millennials you manage want freedom to maneuver at work. They want some latitude when it comes to their schedule, where they do their work, whom they work with, what they do, and how they do it. The problem is that every task, responsibility, and project has parameters that constrain every employee\u2019s freedom.<\/p>\n<p>But as much as they love freedom, Millennials also gravitate to structure and boundaries. For one thing, they don\u2019t want to waste their time. Don\u2019t forget, since they were kids, Millennials have been hyperscheduled by overbearing adults. One Millennial describes it this way: \u201cThe last thing I\u2019m looking for is somebody telling me, \u2018Yeah, do it how you think it should be done,\u2019 but then it turns out she already knows exactly how she wants it done. I don\u2019t want to beat my head against the wall trying to figure something out if you\u2019ve already got it figured out. I definitely am interested in putting my personal stamp on things, but if that\u2019s not going to happen, tell me up front.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If you want to give Millennials more freedom at work, the biggest favor you can do for them is establish clear boundaries and give them a structure within which they can function with some autonomy.<\/p>\n<h3>4) Help Them Keep Score<\/h3>\n<p>Think about a video game that a Millennial might practice and practice, beating one high score after another, set by himself. He wins every time, and nobody has a reason to feel bad. That\u2019s the kind of competition Millennials are looking for: they want to compete against themselves in a safe environment where they can try over and over again to improve on their own performance benchmarks. When it comes to competitiveness at work, this is what one Millennial had to say: \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever they want me to do. Just tell me someone is keeping track of all this stuff I\u2019m doing. Tell me I\u2019m getting credit for it, that I\u2019ve been racking up points here like mad. Tell me someone is keeping score.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When Millennials know you are keeping track of their day-to-day performance, their measuring instinct is sparked and their competitive spirit ignited. Keeping close track of their work tells them that they are important and their work is important. The process motivates them to perform because they want to get credit, score points, earn more of whatever there is to earn.<\/p>\n<h3>5) Negotiate Special Rewards in Very Small Increments<\/h3>\n<p>Today we live in a world in which relationships are governed by an increasingly short-term and transactional logic. Millennials have never known it any other way. Segmented as a market from birth and armed with credit cards, they have been taught to think of themselves as customers in virtually every sphere. Even in their roles as students, most Millennials think of themselves as buying and consuming the learning services sold by schools.<\/p>\n<p>By the time Millennials arrive at the workplace, short-term transactional thinking is second nature to them. They are still thinking like customers. Plug into Millennials\u2019 transactional mind-set. Stop paying them and start buying their results, one by one. The more you trade results for rewards, the more reliable their performance will be. The smaller the increments you buy in, the more effective it will be. The critical element when it comes to rewarding Millennials is letting them know that rewards are tied to concrete actions within their own direct control.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>About the Author<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Bruce Tulgan is an adviser to business leaders all over the world and a sought-after keynote speaker and seminar leader.

Evernote invested significantly in a feature called Work Chat, which allows for collaboration around individual notes. But it doesn\u2019t seem like the company has gotten much of a foothold. How will you tackle the business market? Should we expect the company will orient itself more toward collaboration uses?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"af9b\" class=\"graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote\"><p><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong\">Chris O\u2019Neill: <\/strong>No. It\u2019s important to not try to be all things to all people. You have Slack, you have Hipchat. That\u2019s a well-served market. Let\u2019s just politely say, collaboration and chat is well served. So I don\u2019t see it as, we need to try to do everything. If we do well with frictionless capture of ideas, and world-class search and retrieval, I think we can partner with a lot of other players. Collaboration is a fact, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean we have to carry all the water. I\u2019d just as soon do some integrations and partnerships to fill out that part of it.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p id=\"af77\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Good timing, especially since the Internet monsters are all paying close attention to Slack\u2019s rise, and tools like Facebook At Work are in beta.<\/p>\n<p id=\"d627\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">Still, I was intrigued by the discussion around \u2018collaboration overload\u2019 and the role of \u2018note taking\u2019 in the article:<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"df63\" class=\"graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><p><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong\">Chris O\u2019Neill:<\/strong> Our place is as relevant today as it was when Stepan [Pachikov] started the company 10 years ago.

And the other thing, which may sound counterintuitive, is that it isn\u2019t just information overload\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s collaboration overload. It\u2019s good that we\u2019re working across borders and functions, and silos are coming down.

We need one great place to capture the knowledge in our lives, and then I think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity in helping people easily manipulate that and turn it into other things. Whether it\u2019s turning numbers into charts, or turning text into HTML. There needs to be a central repository.

Tello Goes For It"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The battle for our mobile attention has put convenience and user experience on a pedestal and, as a result, a ton friction has been removed from our day-to-day activities: shopping, ordering food, banking, traveling\u2026 But it often seems that, to gain access to these conveniences, we have no choice but to wade through complex waters, aka mobile service providers. With two-year commitments, opaque plans and fee-tangled bills, many of the carriers that enable today\u2019s celebrated mobile innovations are not, themselves, widely celebrated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is why consumers might want to pay closer attention to MVNOs (mobile virtual network operators). MVNOs give you access to the major US mobile carrier networks (AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, etc.), but with their own pricing and packaging.\u00a0For customers, that can translate to lower rates, more flexible contracts and better customer service. Representing a smaller segment of mobile subscribers (just <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2013\/08\/16\/report-mvnos-are-racking-up-mobile-subscribers-in-the-u-s\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">one in ten US subscribers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> a few years back) and competing against powerhouse brands, MVNOs are the underdog in the mobile service space. This is why when a new provider enters the fray they need to work hard to stand out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is the challenge for the newly announced Tello. Tello runs on Sprint\u2019s network in the US, but has been operating out of the UK for two years already. (The parent company, KeepCalling, has been around since 2002.) At the core of Tello\u2019s US offering is a pledge for \u201cNo Fees, Whatsoever,\u201d as in no activation fee, no overage fee, no processing fee or early termination. Tello plans can be fully customized, so you&#8217;re not paying for something you don&#8217;t use (fitting for those who don&#8217;t use their phones to, you know, make calls), and can be upgraded or downgraded easily if you find, for example, you&#8217;re hitting your data limit. Technically data is unlimited as speed is throttled down to 64kbps once you hit your limit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Things that are also good to know, if you\u2019re thinking about switching providers, is that you can choose to buy a phone from Tello, but there\u2019s also the option to bring your own. As mentioned before, Tello is a contract-free service, but for those who prefer to avoid plans altogether, Tello has a Pay As You Go option that gives you the chance to buy let\u2019s say $5 and use it for national and international calls or texts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Of course, Tello isn\u2019t the first provider to tackle the pain points of mobile service. Ting, for example, offers a plan that allows you to pay based on usage and carriers like T-Mobile often cover the cost of termination to facilitate switching. But scratching out every fee and keeping costs low\u2014Tello has a customizable plan that starts at $5 monthly, or (if you want data) $9\/mo for 100 minutes of talk, 200 texts and 200 MB 4G LTE\u2014gives the company a fair chance to stand out. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Still, one of the bigger questions that comes to mind is, if MVNOs are presenting such competitive offerings, why aren\u2019t a larger share of mobile providers using them? Is it a testimony to long term brand effects of TV advertising? Are consumers still tethered to brick and mortar, taking comfort in having a place to go if something goes awry? (Tello, for example, is exclusively online.) While these factors may have a big impact today, they may lose their foothold as new generation of cell phone users and cord cutters come to market. Tello may be ahead of it\u2019s time\u2014though given early adopters always seem to be ready for the next opportunity to assert their early adopter-ness, that may be an advantage unto itself. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The battle for our mobile attention has put convenience and user experience on a pedestal and, as a result, a ton friction&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87833663,"featured_media":950057,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[13172730,359256448,1732613,359256447,359218128,359216144,9280],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950046"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87833663"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=950046"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950046\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/950057"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=950046"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=950046"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=950046"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":950051,"date":"2016-05-03T09:18:30","date_gmt":"2016-05-03T16:18:30","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=950051"},"modified":"2016-05-03T09:18:30","modified_gmt":"2016-05-03T16:18:30","slug":"education-lessons-from-the-aws-pop-up-loft","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/05\/03\/education-lessons-from-the-aws-pop-up-loft\/","title":{"rendered":"Education lessons from the AWS Pop-up Loft"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>As the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/awsloft.london\/\">AWS Pop-up Loft<\/a>\u00a0closes after its most recent two-week stint, I thought I would catch up with Ian Massingham,\u00a0AWS Technical Evangelist, to see how it\u00a0had gone. To explain, the \u2018loft\u2019 is the ground floor of Eagle House, a converted office block\u00a0on City Road which runs up towards Kings Cross from the heart of London\u2019s tech start-up scene, Old Street and the Silicon\u00a0Roundabout.<\/p>\n<p>The aim of the Loft \u2014 the clue\u2019s in the term \u2018pop-up&#8217; \u2014 is to offer a temporary space to run an educational programme, aimed at\u00a0organisations looking to use AWS\u00a0technologies in anger. \u201cIt was never meant to be a long-term thing,\u201d explains Ian. \u201cWe thought that by coming back\u00a0periodically, we\u2019d be able to connect with different cohorts of customers, at different points in their development.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s an \u201cAsk the Architect\u201d (think: Genius) bar, a co-working space and a room for sessions. Booths for support teams and\u00a0training partners, who are on call to ask questions. The single-track timetable has been filled with back-to-back sessions on a\u00a0wide range of topics, from IoT to Machine Learning, from introductory to deep dive technical, from shorter to longer formats,\u00a0aimed at a variety of audiences.<\/p>\n<p>So, what were my take-away thoughts? Interestingly, these were less about the topics themselves, and more about how they\u00a0were delivered. The model is simple: you register, you come, you learn, you have the opportunity to ask questions and\u00a0participate in workshops, chalk and talk sessions and hackathons. It\u2019s been intense, but that was the plan, says Ian. \u201cWe\u2019ve\u00a0learned a lot from previous pop-ups, on how to make the best use of people\u2019s time.\u201d Not least that the content \u2014 educational\u00a0content, that is \u2014 is king.<\/p>\n<p>While this may appear self-evident, less clear is the importance that should be attached to providing a diverse range of materials. \u201cYou need to create the right interaction channels for different types of customers. While a large base of our\u00a0customers expect to self-serve, others will want full support. And similarly some like to read documents, others like videos,\u00a0others like classroom training, it\u2019s up to us to be ubiquitous, so people won\u2019t get unhappy even if the majority of content is not\u00a0directly appropriate to their needs.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Secondary plus points concerned the location (\u201cYes, sure, the location is important, we&#8217;re right in centre of startup\u00a0community\u201d), the food (\u201cDevelopers run on beer and pizza\u201d) and so on but these were seen as hygiene factors for the pop-up.<\/p>\n<p>Formal feedback has not been collated but the signs are good that the key goal of the event, to \u201cget people productive on the\u00a0platform,\u201d was achieved. As, if not more importantly was that people got what they wanted and more. \u201cI was just told, \u2018This is great, I love it, it\u2019s so convenient to engage with your architects.\u2019 \u201d<\/p>\n<p>The message, as I read it, was one that events of any size and scale could take away: whatever the format, make delivery of a\u00a0range of excellent content, to fit a diverse audience, the primary goal. So, yes, context is important: nobody wants to travel to the back of beyond to attend an event of any form. But head and\u00a0shoulders above this is the range and applicability of the content.<\/p>\n<p>If this appears\u00a0obvious, it\u00a0begs a\u00a0question \u2014 why do so many events, held in far more glitzy and dare I say, exotic locations (sorry, Shoreditch) tend to forget\u00a0this simple, yet important\u00a0truth?\u00a0Like the software developed without regard for its users, so should events focus first and\u00a0foremost on meeting the needs of their attendees.

A slash command (\u2018\/asana\u2019) lists tasks, and arguments to the command can lead to creating tasks, assigning tasks, and commenting on them.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"7205\" class=\"graf--figure graf-after--p\">\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\n<div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded\" data-image-id=\"1*hh1-vMpL5j1-PnTcO_dyaA.jpeg\" data-width=\"1154\" data-height=\"976\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*hh1-vMpL5j1-PnTcO_dyaA.jpeg\" data-scroll=\"native\"><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\" width=\"75\" height=\"62\"><\/canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-2.medium.com\/max\/800\/1*hh1-vMpL5j1-PnTcO_dyaA.jpeg\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-2.medium.com\/max\/800\/1*hh1-vMpL5j1-PnTcO_dyaA.jpeg\" \/><\/div>\n<\/div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Asana integration in Slack<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p id=\"946a\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--figure\">But I confess that I have found this style of integration difficult. The two models of use\u200a\u2014\u200achat-based conversation in Slack and task-based coordination in Asana\u200a\u2014\u200adon\u2019t align for me, and the mapping from an Asana workspace to a Slack channel doesn\u2019t always line up right. And I don\u2019t necessarily want to have every tweak to a task dumped into the channel in Slack, per se. I don\u2019t want that endless stream of noise, because Slack is noisy enough.<\/p>\n<p id=\"5764\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">I recently encountered a tool that takes a different tack. <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http:\/\/busybotapp.com\/\" data-href=\"http:\/\/busybotapp.com\">Busybot<\/a> avoids the mismatch problem by operating in a parasitic way. By that I mean it relies totally on Slack\u2019s architecture to the greatest extent possible. For example, there is no independent login: you use Slack\u2019s login. And once logged in, the channels of the team that you sign into are duplicated as contexts for tasks in Busybot.<\/p>\n<p id=\"b64b\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">Here\u2019s the login:<\/p>\n<figure id=\"e104\" class=\"graf--figure graf-after--p\">\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\n<div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded\" data-image-id=\"1*SfyzO-P2aFBcy0XxBfXRvg.png\" data-width=\"529\" data-height=\"413\" data-is-featured=\"true\" data-scroll=\"native\"><canvas class=\"progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas\" width=\"75\" height=\"57\"><\/canvas><img class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-2.medium.com\/max\/800\/1*SfyzO-P2aFBcy0XxBfXRvg.png\" data-src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-2.medium.com\/max\/800\/1*SfyzO-P2aFBcy0XxBfXRvg.png\" \/><\/div>\n<\/div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">login for Busybot<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p id=\"dc44\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--figure\">Here\u2019s the #general channel for workfutures.io in Slack.

I\u2019ve been told by Busybot\u2019s CEO and founder, Damian Bramanis, that various new features are coming, like multi-team functionality, new ways to groups tasks in views, and tags.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"a004\" class=\"graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Conclusions and Takeaway<\/h4>\n<p id=\"b1f2\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--h4\">Busybot works for me despite the minimal degree of metadata, and I think the reason is the equivalence between the Slack and Busybot information models: I don\u2019t have to switch gears mentally when I move from Slack to Busybot, or vice versa. It feels like I am in the same place, just looking at different attributes of the same system of information. Moving from Slack to Busybot feels like I am just zooming in on task details that are suppressed on the Slack side. Because the two \u2018sides\u2019 look so much alike and are so tightly connected, I avoid the cognitive switching costs of moving from Slack to non-parasitic tools, like Asana.<\/p>\n<p id=\"84b4\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">Yes, I\u2019d like to be able to do more with Busybot, though. For example, I\u2019d like to be able to change task attributes on the Slack side, like adding a comment to a task, so that the text of the task comment would appear both in the Slack chat history and in the task comment thread. Damian tells me they are working on ways of accomplishing more sophisticated sorts of integration like that, perhaps with a \/busybot command, or clever use of the channel topic (setting the topic to the name of a task, for example, so that commands could refer to that task).<\/p>\n<p id=\"9de3\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p graf--last\">At any rate, I will be watching the developments at Busybot with close attention.<\/p>\n<section class=\" section--body section--last\">\n<div class=\"section-divider layoutSingleColumn\">\n<hr class=\"section-divider\" \/>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner layoutSingleColumn\">\n<p class=\"graf--p graf--first graf--last\">Crossposted 1 May 2016 on <a href=\"http:\/\/workfutures.io\">workfutures.io<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p id=\"cf7d\" class=\"graf--p graf--first graf--last\">Update 1 May 2016 4:30pm: Several folks mentioned <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http:\/\/swipesapp.com\/slack\/\" data-href=\"http:\/\/swipesapp.com\/slack\/\">Swipes for Slack<\/a>, as another approach to accomplish some or all of what Busybot does.

Among these titans, few loom as large as Bob Metcalfe. Inventor of Ethernet. Coiner of Metcalfe&#8217;s Law. Founder of 3com. <\/p>\n<p>Bob was there in the early days at PARC, and today you can find him at University of Texas promoting entrepreneurship and startups, and keeping his eyes open for the next big thing. <\/p>\n<p>When considering keynote speakers for <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/change\/\">Gigaom Change<\/a>, an event about the present disruption of business through new technology such as AI and robots, I wanted to find someone who had seen a new technology arrive at the very beginning and then ushered it through to commercial success, and finally helped to make it impact the entire world. <\/p>\n<p>I had a short list of candidates and Bob was at the top. Luckily, he said yes. <\/p>\n<p>I caught up with him Monday, April 25, and all but ambushed him with a series of questions about the kinds of changes he expects technology to bring about next. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Byron Reese: So I&#8217;ll ask you the question that Alan Turing posed way back: &#8220;Can a machine think?&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Bob Metcalfe:<\/strong> Yes, I mean, if human beings can think then machines can think. <\/p>\n<p><strong>And so, you believe we&#8217;ll develop an AI.<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p>Yes, absolutely. The brain consists of these little machines, and eventually we&#8217;ll be able to build little machines and then they&#8217;ll be able to think.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you have an opinion on what consciousness is?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It has something to do with attention. That is, focusing the activities of the thinking machine; focusing them in on a certain set of inputs, and that&#8217;s sort of what consciousness is.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you think we&#8217;ll make conscious machines?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes. An interesting case of consciousness is when the selected inputs, that is the ones selected for attention are internal, that is self-consciousness\u2014being able to look down on our own thoughts, which also seems to be possible with some version of a neural net. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Would a conscious machine have inalienable rights?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Whoa! Do human beings have inalienable rights, I\u2019m not sure. <\/p>\n<p><strong>We claim we have a right to life and it\u2019s generally regarded there are things called universal human rights.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a conflict of interest because we&#8217;re declaring that we have our own rights. Actually, it worries me a little how in modern day life, the list of things that are &#8216;rights&#8217; are getting longer and longer. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Why does that worry you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It just seems to be more a conflict of interest. Sort of a failure to recognize that we live in a reality that requires effort and responsibility, and &#8216;rights&#8217; somehow is a short-cut, as in we have a &#8216;right&#8217; to stuff as opposed to having to work for it. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you believe that robots and AI will be able to do all the jobs that humans can do?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think so, I think that&#8217;s inevitably the case. The big issue as you well know is whether it&#8217;s man-versus-the-machine or man-and-the-machine, and I tend to come down on the &#8216;man-and-the-machine&#8217; side of things that is, humans will be enhanced by their robots not replaced by their robots.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So, some kind of human-machine synthesis like augmented memory and all of those sorts of things.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, we have that already. I have the entire Google world at my disposal, and it&#8217;s now part of my habit when something comes up that can&#8217;t be remembered, I quickly take out my iPhone and I know what it is within a minute. You know, like, &#8216;Who was Attila the Hun,&#8217; that came up the other day, and they can read the entire life of Attila the Hun within a minute. Although the interface between Google and my thought process is awkward between typing and reading. I can imagine eventually that we&#8217;ll have Google inserted in our head more efficiently. And then it won&#8217;t take 10 years to learn French, it&#8217;ll take just a few minutes to learn French because you&#8217;ll just &#8216;plug it in&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think people will do in the future if machines and AI&#8217;s are doing all the things that have to be done.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know. I guess, you know, a hundred years ago everybody knew how to milk cows\u2014well, 40 percent of the population knew how to milk a cow. And now, you know, the percentage of people who know how to milk a cow is pretty small and there are robots doing it. And somehow all of those people managed to get employed in something else, and now they&#8217;re UX\/UI engineers, or they&#8217;re bloggers or they&#8217;re data scientists. Somehow all those people stopped milking cows and they started doing something at a higher-level in Maslow&#8217;s hierarchy.  <\/p>\n<p><strong>There&#8217;s two potential problems with that though. One is if the disruption comes too quickly to be absorbed without social instability. Or, the second problem is in the past we always found things to do because there were things we could do better than machines could do. But, what if there&#8217;s nothing we can do better than a machine can do? Or are there things only people can do.<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ve wandered out of my area of expertise. Although, on the &#8216;happened too quickly&#8217; front, as we&#8217;re seeing in Austin this week, the status quo can slow things down like the Uber-Lyft slow-down initiative here in Austin. We like taxis here in Austin rather than Uber and Lift apparently because they&#8217;re safer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are you working on? Enough about the big issues, how do you spend your days?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I spend my days on the big issues, and the big issue is innovation as a driver of freedom and prosperity; and the tool of innovation that I&#8217;ve settled on perfecting and promoting and professing is startups. Startups as vehicles\u2014as innovation vehicles\u2014and mostly coming out of research universities. So most of what I do is focused on that view of the world.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why did you choose startups as the mechanism of innovation?<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p>Because startups, in my experience, have been the most effective way to innovate. Everyone loves innovation as long as they&#8217;re not being innovated upon, and then as soon as they&#8217;re innovated upon they become the status quo, which is resourceful and nasty and mean. And, so the most effective tools in my experience against the status quo have been these startups, which at their core are champions of innovation. I got the word champion from Bob Langer at MIT; he believes these new technologies need champions, which is why he likes startups. A startup is a place where champions go and gather resources, coordinate their efforts and scale up. So, I guess it&#8217;s their effectiveness in having real impact with innovations that causes me to admire and profess startups.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s interesting though that as much as what you call the status quo can slow down innovation, nothing can really ever be stopped can it? I mean, big whale oil didn&#8217;t stop kerosene and big kerosene didn&#8217;t stop electricity.<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p>The rate of advance can be slowed. The internet is old now, it started running in &#8217;69. Just think how many years have passed, 50 years, to get where we are today. Is that fast or slow, by the way?<\/p>\n<p><strong>I would say that&#8217;s very fast.  We&#8217;ve had recorded history, and by that I mean writing, for 5000 years. We have only therefore had the Internet for 1% of recorded history. Are you overall optimistic about the future that all these new technologies and startups are going to usher in? Do you think it\u2019s going to be a better future, or not?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m a better-future believer, an optimist, and enthusiast. I think cynics are often right but they never get anything done. Just as a matter of choice, without assessment, I choose to be optimistic.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Last question: Aren&#8217;t startups fundamentally irrational in the sense that the likelihoods of success are so small and the risk so high that one has to be somewhat self-deluded to undertake one? I ask this, of course, as someone who has done several.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Maybe that circles us back to your big question before, maybe that\u2019s what makes us humans, is that we need to delude ourselves to thereby make progress. Maybe robots won\u2019t do startups because they\u2019re too rational. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of the nice things about the Internet Age being relatively new is that many of its earliest pioneers are not only&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":404,"featured_media":950128,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[359216901,359218993,359256381,359216542,359217090],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950029"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/404"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=950029"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950029\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/950128"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=950029"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=950029"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=950029"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":950031,"date":"2016-04-29T08:00:52","date_gmt":"2016-04-29T15:00:52","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=950031"},"modified":"2016-04-29T08:05:44","modified_gmt":"2016-04-29T15:05:44","slug":"a-new-era-at-google-hardware-moving-to-the-foreground","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/04\/29\/a-new-era-at-google-hardware-moving-to-the-foreground\/","title":{"rendered":"A  new era at Google?

Even so, there is still a great deal of fear, uncertainty and doubt around the viability of clouds built upon OpenStack. The real question here is if that FUD is unfounded for today\u2019s emerging markets.<\/p>\n<p>That means taking a closer look at OpenStack is a must for businesses delving further into public, private and hybrid clouds.<\/p>\n<p>The OpenStack Project, which is now managed by the OpenStack Foundation, came into being back in 2010 as joint venture between NASA and RackSpace Hosting, with the goal of bringing collaborative, open sourced based software to the then emerging cloud market. Today, the OpenStack Foundation boasts that some 500 companies have joined the project and the community now collaborates around a six-month, time-based release cycle.<\/p>\n<p>Openstack,\u00a0which is basically an open-source software platform designed for cloud computing, has become a viable alternative to the likes of Amazon (S3, EC2), Microsoft Azure and Digital Ocean. Recent research by the <a href=\"http:\/\/image.slidesharecdn.com\/openstackmagnum2016-02-18-160220050621\/95\/openstack-magnum-5-638.jpg?cb=1455944854\">451 Group has predicted a 40% CAGR<\/a>, with the OpenStack Market reaching some $3.5 billion by 2018. Enough of a market share to make all players involved take notice.<\/p>\n<p>However, the big news out of the OpenStack Summit Austin 2016, comes in the form of product announcements, with more and more vendors aligning themselves with the platform.<\/p>\n<p>For example, HPE has announced its HPE <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.hpcloud.com\/pdf\/static\/HPE_Helion_OpenStack_3.0_Solution_Brief.pdf\">Helion OpenStack 3.0<\/a> platform release, which is designed to improve efficiency and ease private cloud development, all without vendor lock-in problems.<\/p>\n<p>Cisco is also embracing the OpenStack movement with its <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cisco.com\/c\/en\/us\/products\/cloud-systems-management\/metapod\/index.html\">Cisco MetaPod<\/a>, an on-premise, preconfigured solution based on OpenStack.<\/p>\n<p>Another solution out of the summit is the <a href=\"http:\/\/api.viglink.com\/api\/click?format=go&amp;jsonp=vglnk_146161783038712&amp;key=4a111b041e558f2e9ee27fa7415b4915&amp;libId=ingedxbp010113aw000DLbm4cfcqp&amp;loc=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.networkworld.com%2Farticle%2F3060070%2Fopen-source-tools%2Fcool-products-at-openstack-austin-summit.html%23slide5&amp;v=1&amp;out=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.avinetworks.com%2F&amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&amp;title=Cool%20products%20at%20OpenStack%20Austin%20Summit%20%7C%20Network%20World&amp;txt=More%20info.\">Avi Vantage Platform<\/a> from AVI Networks, which promises to bring software-defined application services to OpenStack clouds, along with load balancing, analytics, and autoscaling. In other words, Avi is aiming to bring agility to OpenStack clouds.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the most impressive news out of the summit comes from Dell and Red Hat, with the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.community.dell.com\/dell-blogs\/dell4enterprise\/b\/dell4enterprise\/archive\/2016\/04\/20\/delivering-on-the-promise-of-openstack-clouds\">Dell Red Hat OpenStack Cloud Solution Version 5.0<\/a>, \u00a0which incorporates an integrated, modular, co-engineered, validated core architecture, that leverages optional validated extensions to create a robust OpenStack cloud that integrates with the rest of the OpenStack community offerings.<\/p>\n<p>Other vendors making major announcements at the event include F5 networks, Datera, DreamHost, FalconStor, Mirantis, Nexenta Systems, Midokura, SwiftStack, PureStorage, and many others. All of those announcements have one core element in common, and that is the OpenStack community. In other words, OpenStack is here to stay and competitors must now take the threat of the open-source cloud movement a little more seriously.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I am at the OpenStack Summit here in Austin and the announcements and releases keep rolling out, illustrating that the growing OpenStack&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8020068,"featured_media":950015,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[359218029,359226341],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950014"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8020068"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=950014"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950014\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/950015"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=950014"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=950014"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=950014"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":950005,"date":"2016-04-22T07:47:02","date_gmt":"2016-04-22T14:47:02","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=950005"},"modified":"2016-04-22T07:47:02","modified_gmt":"2016-04-22T14:47:02","slug":"mobile-strategy-and-roi-calculation","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/04\/22\/mobile-strategy-and-roi-calculation\/","title":{"rendered":"Mobile Strategy and ROI Calculation"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to developing a successful mobile strategy, and building a long-lasting relationship with customers, a CMO is often faced with difficult considerations around the best way to measure success.<\/p>\n<p>The process of creating an app and investing significant amounts of money acquiring users is no longer enough to remain on the \u2018first screen\u2019 of any given mobile device &#8212; which is where any organization ultimately needs to be.

You may see improvement in your engagement, retention, and ultimately, your revenue numbers. Perhaps obviously, this is the first and easiest way to consider ROI.<\/p>\n<p>Once you get a grasp on it, and you begin to see these numbers change, calculating ROI is relatively easy. Think of it this way &#8212; if we grow a metric like average revenue per user (ARPU) from $5 to $10 using a marketing automation program, and we have 1 million monthly active users, then we can put $5 million per month into the credit column. If the total monthly spend on the program amounts to $100,000, then that will result in a very (very!) satisfactory 900% ROI.<\/p>\n<p>Granted it won\u2019t always be ARPU that we\u2019re measuring, but in the vast majority of cases, there will be metrics with which we will measure mobile success, and once we add a quantifiable value to these, we\u2019ll be able to establish decent ROI estimates.<\/p>\n<h3>The Campaign Level<\/h3>\n<p>Another, perhaps more reliable, way to measure ROI is to focus specifically on individual campaigns. Doing this will allow you to measure the effect of any changes within specific campaigns and sum them to provide a total benefit.<\/p>\n<p>Assuming that you\u2019re using a good marketing automation platform, you should get clear results from each individual campaign, against whichever metrics you choose to use, and compared to the control group in order to isolate for other variables. By combining these multiple campaigns, we have a cumulative benefit that can be used to calculate ROI on the overall spend. Of course this approach won\u2019t necessarily enable you to take account of some benefits, such as the effect an overall improved experience can have on word-of-mouth &#8211; but it\u2019s probably better to be conservative when calculating ROI anyway.<\/p>\n<p>One thing that is vital to remember: don\u2019t go looking for evidence of \u2018good results\u2019 <i>after<\/i> you\u2019ve ran the campaign. Human nature being what it is, you\u2019ll probably find some. The key is to first identify the metrics that you want to have an impact on, and the effect that you hope to have <i>before<\/i> you implement the campaign.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to developing a successful mobile strategy, and building a long-lasting relationship with customers, a CMO is often faced with&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87883948,"featured_media":950006,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[359218794,359256435],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950005"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87883948"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=950005"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950005\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/950006"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=950005"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=950005"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=950005"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":949998,"date":"2016-04-19T06:17:26","date_gmt":"2016-04-19T13:17:26","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=949998"},"modified":"2016-04-19T06:22:34","modified_gmt":"2016-04-19T13:22:34","slug":"the-symbiotic-relationship-of-the-osi-model-and-application-performance","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/04\/19\/the-symbiotic-relationship-of-the-osi-model-and-application-performance\/","title":{"rendered":"The Symbiotic Relationship of the OSI Model and Application Performance"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s no secret that Application Performance Monitoring (APM) is becoming a critical competency in today\u2019s enterprise networks. After all, so many enterprises are moving to a cloud based model that leverages tiers of service, which brings unforeseen complexity into the task of keeping things running smoothly.<\/p>\n<p>Traditionally, most IT managers have thought that application performance was a direct result of the static resources available, focusing on elements such as processor performance, available ram, and perhaps the traffic saturation associated with the Local Area Network (LAN). Although monitoring those elements still remains critical for providing adequate performance, the APM game has changed, or more appropriately evolved, to something that must address much more that the status of the basic hardware that makes up a network.<\/p>\n<p>That change (or evolution) has been driven by the adoption of technologies such as cloud services, hybrid cloud deployments, mobility, content delivery networks (CDNs), hosted databases and so on. Those new technologies have changed the basic dynamic of how an application is delivered to an enduser and how the endpoint interacts with the data associated with the application.<\/p>\n<p>A good example of that comes in the form of a line of business application delivered by a cloud service, where a hosted application server delivers the application to an endpoint via a browser connection and the associated data is stored on a hosted database and the connectivity to the application and data is provided via the internet over a VPN. In that situation there are multiple elements that have to work in concert to provide acceptable application availability and performance, and any one of those \u201ctiers\u201d can have an effect on the application. What\u2019s more, any single tier can impact any other, especially when virtualization is involved or a software defined solution (SDN, SDDC, SDS, etc.) underpins operations.<\/p>\n<p>Take the above example and apply it to the real world, where an IT manager gets a trouble ticket forwarded from the help desk that simply states \u201cuser is complaining of a slow application\u201d.\u00a0 For that IT manager, the big question becomes where to start. Using the traditional approach, the starting point becomes taking a look at the hardware and network. However, that approach is all but useless in today\u2019s world.<\/p>\n<p>Today, the IT Manager must turn to an APM platform to track down a problem and getting the proper intelligence out of that platform is a critical component for successfully remediating any application performance problem. That said, the typical APM platform is little more than a measurement and reporting tool, it will assist an IT manager in solving the problem, but that IT manager must have an understanding of how the tiers of a hybrid, cloud served network delivers an application. An understanding that brings us to how the OSI model can serve as a tier template for application delivery.<\/p>\n<p>If you think about the seven layers of the OS model and what each is responsible for in the realm of network communications, it becomes clear how some of those layers can be mapped to the tiers of application delivery.<\/p>\n<p>The OSI Model is broken out into layers, which has specific functions. Each of those functions map directly to the movement of information across a network.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/04\/OSI_Model.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-949999\"><img src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/04\/OSI_Model.jpg\" alt=\"OSI_Model\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-949999\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/04\/OSI_Model.jpg 480w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/04\/OSI_Model-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/04\/OSI_Model-187x140.jpg 187w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/04\/OSI_Model-33x25.jpg 33w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/04\/OSI_Model-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" \/><\/a>\n<p>If you align the basic concept with APM, it becomes clear how a symbiotic relationship is formed between application delivery and the constructs of the OSI model.

Now, after many attempts to create more social shared spaces, new aesthetics to counter the old-school tastes of Boomers and Gen Xers, and other supposed innovations, we are seeing some new takes that ditch the millennial psychobabble and which really try to get at what is emerging as travelers\u2019 real desires.<\/p>\n<p>Hyatt has launched a new <a href=\"http:\/\/centric.hyatt.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Centric<\/a> line of hotels, which feels like a serious departure from the adjective-laden attempts to get at the psyche of business and leisure travelers, and which instead just gets out of the way.

BITCOIN\u2019s platform, often referred to as a blockchain, uses an innovative approach to keep transactions secure, validate ownership and guarantee provenance.<\/p>\n<p>A blockchain consists of a distributed cryptographic ledger shared amongst all nodes participating in the network, where every successfully performed transaction is recorded and shared. In other words, blockchains are proving to be a fully auditable, incorruptible database that can deny any known hack or attack.<\/p>\n<p>Although the importance of the blockchain is often lost amongst the discussion of digital currency, blockchains have the potential to disrupt how the internet itself works. Simply put, there is a lot more to blockchains than just crypto-currency and monetary applications. Truth be told, a blockchain is a decentralized ledger protocol (and\/or platform) that can govern both financial and non-financial types of application states.<\/p>\n<p>A blockchain can be used to power decentralized business logic, which is contained in a cryptographic \u201celement\u201d that has intrinsic value and can only be unlocked if certain conditions are met. The business logic executes on a blockchain platform (a decentralized cloud service) once an automatic process validates that the terms and conditions set forth by participating parties are met.<\/p>\n<p>Those concepts can be used to fuel the creation of P2P (peer-to-peer) or decentralized network solutions that allow virtual communities to create secure, auditable and hack proof services and applications.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, blockchains may reign supreme in distributed, shared environments that are used by both open and closed digital communities \u2013 a concept that has been well vetted by BITCOIN as its secure methodology to handle currency.<\/p>\n<p><strong>However, that leaves one question \u2013 how does one build a blockchain and create a community that can use it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One answer comes in the form of an open source platform that goes by the moniker of Ethereum, which is touted as a platform for decentralized applications, but in reality has become a catalyst for building blockchain based solutions.\u00a0 Etherium leverages the blockchain ideology by providing both the platform and the development tools to build blockchain based community solutions, which are decentralized in nature and highly resilient, while also being incorruptible.<\/p>\n<p>However, the ideology of a crypto-currency still permeates the Ethereum platform, yet it does not have to have any monetary value. In Ethereum\u2019s case, that crypto-currency is more appropriately referred to as a cryptofuel, which Ethereum has dubbed Ether. Ether is used to power transactions, pay for computational steps and democratize the distributed platform.<\/p>\n<p>Without Ether, distributed applications could fall prey to infinite loops, excessive data consumption and many other problems that could effectively destroy a decentralized application and applications are the key component of a community.<\/p>\n<p>However, to use Ether as a cryptofuel to power a creative process, one must embrace the Ethereum platform, which means there has to be much more to Ethereum than a blockchain and crytpofuel. To that end, Ethereum has created a development environment called ETH\/DEV, which offers IDEs, tools and resources used to build decentralized applications. Those applications can be fueled by Ether and therein lies the most important element of the blockchain.<\/p>\n<p>The blockchain itself keeps track of the fuel units (Ether), and transactions can be assigned a cost of ether units, or even Ether payments, making all interactions transaction based. Ether does not need to have a particular monetary value associated with it \u2013 Ether could be based upon reputation points earned, contributions to the community, or any other activity that adds or uses some type of value measurement.<\/p>\n<p>For some community projects, content or code contributions may be the key element for earning Ether, which can then be used by the person earning the Ether to \u201cpurchase\u201d other elements from the community or escalate content or reach out to new audiences. The blockchain comes into play be creating and maintaining the ledger of who has how much Ether and how that Ether was earned, spent or transferred. In short, the applicability of Ether is limitless.<\/p>\n<p>The concept of using a crypto currency like Ether brings many possibilities to light \u2013 for example, digital contracts can be secured using Ether and then recorded in perpetuity via the blockchain. What\u2019s more, Ether can be traded for services, software and other virtual elements, creating an economy based upon distributed applications.<\/p>\n<p>One thing is certain, block chain technology is here to stay and organizations such as Ethereum are on the cusp of creating new decentralized solutions that eschew traditional borders and physical entities.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Perhaps BITCOIN\u2019s greatest gift to the web is not the disruptive nature of a digital currency, but the platform used to build&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8020068,"featured_media":949980,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[214789173,277387,359256425],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/949976"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8020068"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=949976"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/949976\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/949980"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=949976"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=949976"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=949976"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":949985,"date":"2016-04-15T06:58:15","date_gmt":"2016-04-15T13:58:15","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=949985"},"modified":"2016-04-15T12:03:57","modified_gmt":"2016-04-15T19:03:57","slug":"the-driverless-economy-what-our-city-streets-might-be-like-in-2020","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/04\/15\/the-driverless-economy-what-our-city-streets-might-be-like-in-2020\/","title":{"rendered":"The driverless economy: what our city streets might be like in 2020"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Paradoxically, here in early 2016, we are witnessing the lowest U.S. gas prices in years, but we are also moving toward a transportation era based on dramatically different economic premises, most obviously driverless vehicles. So it seems a perfect time to dig into the deep economics of cars, their impacts on city life, and what we can anticipate coming down the pike with the rise of driverless vehicles and smarter ways of living in cities once we can depend on AI-augmented transport.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps there is nothing so pedestrian as parking, a global phenomenon that we generally take for granted along with many of the other externalized costs associated with car culture. The hard fact is that the typical car spends 95 percent of its working life parked. This means that little of the value of the car is actually realized. And, <a href=\"http:\/\/publicaffairsresources.aaa.biz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/Your-Driving-Costs-2014.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">according to the AAA<\/a>, the average cost of owning and maintaining a mid-sized car in the U.S. in 2014 was almost $9,000, of which $1,300 per year goes just to parking! Therefore we should not be surprised that parking is a <a href=\"https:\/\/pando.com\/2014\/01\/30\/the-future-of-the-100-billion-parking-industry\/\" target=\"_blank\">$100B industry<\/a>. This despite the fact that as much as 98 percent of car trips \u2014 at least in Los Angeles \u2014 start or end with free parking, according to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1080\/01944363.2015.1092879\" target=\"_blank\">California Household Travel survey<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Parking consumes a great deal of time, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.accessmagazine.org\/articles\/spring-2011\/free-parking-free-markets\/\" target=\"_blank\">according<\/a> to Daniel Shoup, 16 studies from 1927 to 2001 found that 30 percent of the cars in congested downtown traffic were cruising to find parking, on average. He also notes that more recently, in 2006 and 2007, 28 percent of the drivers stopped at traffic signals in Manhattan and 45 percent in Brooklyn were searching for curbside parking.The average American takes four car trips a day, and if you figure two are commuting based, that can still translate into a half hour or more of looking for a space.<\/p>\n<p>We seldom think of how much of our cities are given over to cars, but in one study it was found that 14 percent of Los Angeles is devoted to parking. Barclay\u2019s Capital reported that we could see a 60 percent decline in the number of cars on the road, but the impact on parking could be much greater.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, the emergence of driverless vehicles suggests a great deal about the future of cities, and the impact on parking may be considerable. First of all, it\u2019s clear that the on-demand car services like Uber and Lyft (along with car manufacturers like GM and Ford) have plans to provide driverless transportation to replace \u2018drivered\u2019 cars. That means that cars will not be parked after you get to the office, movie theater, or even grocery store.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.caee.utexas.edu\/prof\/kockelman\/public_html\/TRB15SAVsinAustin.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">One study<\/a> suggested that a single driverless car could replace up to 12 drivered cars. Instead of being parked at some destinations, the driverless car will simply move on to the next pick up. Another consideration is that driverless cars may be folded into municipal transport plans, like trains, buses, ferries, and bicycles, and not managed like taxis or on-demand cars services, at all.<\/p>\n<p>Even for those cars that are privately owned \u2014 which is likely to be a much smaller number considering how cheap Uberish services might be once the driver is out of the picture \u2014 driverless cars may be much more efficiently parked than human-managed ones, requiring dramatically less parking.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/04\/parking2880-1024x517.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-949988\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-949988\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/04\/parking2880-1024x517-680x343.jpg\" alt=\"parking2880-1024x517\" width=\"680\" height=\"343\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/04\/parking2880-1024x517-680x343.jpg 680w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/04\/parking2880-1024x517-300x151.jpg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/04\/parking2880-1024x517-768x388.jpg 768w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/04\/parking2880-1024x517-968x489.jpg 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/04\/parking2880-1024x517-210x106.jpg 210w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/04\/parking2880-1024x517-50x25.jpg 50w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/04\/parking2880-1024x517-320x162.jpg 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/04\/parking2880-1024x517-640x323.jpg 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/04\/parking2880-1024x517-804x406.jpg 804w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/04\/parking2880-1024x517.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nSource: <a href=\"http:\/\/la.curbed.com\/2015\/11\/30\/9895842\/how-much-parking-los-angeles\" target=\"_blank\">Curbed Los Angeles<\/a><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The frontiers of the future will be the ruins of the unsustainable.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>One thing that is bound to change is the way that municipalities require a great deal of parking allocated for new housing, based on historic patterns.

As a direct consequence, car insurance will plummet, with a drop from coverage of $125 billion in covered losses in the U.S. today, down to as little as $50 billion in 2040. But this is hard to predict, since we have no prior data. It could be much, much lower.<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/r7_lwq3BfkY\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center>Source: The University of Texas at Austin<\/p>\n<p>In the simulation above, we can get a sense of the driverless future. The white rectangles represent cars that have been \u2018scheduled\u2019 to pass through an intersection,while yellows have yet to be scheduled. But once scheduled, the cars are coordinated in their passage, so that traffic signals are not necessary, and the flow rate of the cars is much, much faster, without the need to stop once scheduled.<\/p>\n<p>The economics of frictionless traffic \u2014 without traffic lights, traffic jams, and built-in delays \u2014 is another large factor in the net savings from driverless transport. Living and working in the city of 2025 will feel totally different, and not just because there is no driver turning the wheel. It will be a totally foreign landscape, with little parking, no congestion, and much more space at street level dedicated to people, and with significantly fewer cars in view at any time. Driverless won\u2019t mean carless, but cars will no longer dominate our cities as they do today. And I can\u2019t wait.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Paradoxically, here in early 2016, we are witnessing the lowest U.S. gas prices in years, but we are also moving toward a&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2184122,"featured_media":949991,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[359256429,2375067,359256430,359256428,359256431,10363],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/949985"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2184122"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=949985"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/949985\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/949991"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=949985"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=949985"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=949985"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":949986,"date":"2016-04-15T06:49:59","date_gmt":"2016-04-15T13:49:59","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=949986"},"modified":"2016-04-15T06:51:11","modified_gmt":"2016-04-15T13:51:11","slug":"insights-from-vr-world-congress-prioritise-storytelling-over-individual-skills","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/04\/15\/insights-from-vr-world-congress-prioritise-storytelling-over-individual-skills\/","title":{"rendered":"Insights from VR World Congress: prioritise storytelling over individual skills"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>As I left the aspirationally named VR World Congress in Bristol, England (We just thought, \u201cLet\u2019s go crazy,\u201d event founder\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bentrewhella\">Ben Trewhella<\/a>\u00a0told me of the 750-delegate event that started as a meetup), I found myself puzzling over a number of questions.<\/p>\n<p>Whether VR is going to explode as a technology platform, extending way beyond its gaming origins, was not among them. The number of potential use cases \u2014 enabling surgeons to conduct operations in the \u2018presence\u2019 of thousands of students, or architectural walkthroughs of new building designs \u2014 left me in no doubt.<\/p>\n<p>Equally, I have a firmer idea of timescales. While displays and platforms may have passed a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2016\/04\/12\/bringing-the-virtual-reality-experience-to-life-for-facebooks-f8-developers\/\">threshold<\/a>\u00a0of acceptability, they are still evolving. The consensus was that we now have at least a year of lead time, during which hardware will improve, along three dimensions: latency, frame rate and pixel density, said\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/frankvitz\">Frank Vitz<\/a>, Creative Director at Cryengine.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, software and content providers are discovering how to make the most of it all. But what new skills and capabilities need to be learned? The answer is not so straightforward, it transpires, as many of them (3D graphics, animation, behavioural design, data integration) are already available.<\/p>\n<p>Less straightforward is understanding how this palette of skills should\u00a0be integrated. In mobile and web development for example, User Experience (UX) is a hot topic. Makes sense \u2014 the best apps are those which get things right by the user, offering potentially complex functionality and services in simple, accessible ways.<\/p>\n<p>Virtual Reality adds extra dimensions (quite literally) to the notion of experience. Not only is the environment immersive but it is also non-linear. Whereas most web sites and indeed, mobile apps tend to operate on a tree-walk basis (where you drop down a menu level then go \u2018back\u2019 to the main menu when done), VR removes this constraint.<\/p>\n<p>From a construction perspective, this changes the game. A mobile or web team might have a UX guy, an adjunct who can add a layer of gaily coloured iconography to an app, as UX is just one thing to get right. In VR however, the experience \u2014 VX if you will \u2014 is everything, and needs to sit at the centre of the project.<\/p>\n<p>As a consequence, many of my discussions at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=%23VRWC\">#VRWC<\/a>\u00a0were less about individual skills, and more about how to build the right skills mix into tight, multidisciplinary teams that can make the most of what VR has to offer.\u00a0\u201cYou can\u2019t just put out any old content and hope it will do well,\u201d said Ben Trewhella.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUnless you are delivering an enhanced service, then what is the point?\u201d concurred\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/rickcc\">Rick Chapman<\/a>, high tech sector specialist at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bristolandbath.co.uk\/\">Invest Bristol &amp; Bath<\/a>, who used the evolution of 3D techniques in film as an illustration. \u201cThe first 3D films used 3D as a gimmick. Avatar, whatever you think of its plot, was conceived and filmed for 3D.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Delivering VR-first experiences is a real, and potentially new, skill. The idea that VR is about storytelling came up repeatedly: it appears that holding someone\u2019s attention in an immersive environment is tantamount to telling a good story, and anecdotal evidence suggested that those working at the leading edge of VR are also the better storytellers.<\/p>\n<p>This takes the conversation beyond base skills to how they should be harnessed. \u201cYes, you need the right mix of capabilities, but you also need empathy, you reed rapport, you need to understand charisma,\u201d said Rick. \u201cConsider \u2014 language is a capability, but with charisma and rapport you don\u2019t need to be so reliant on verbal acuity.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This is not simply a message for design agencies, gaming companies and animation studios. If VR is to become mainstream, larger companies keen to engage better with their customers, from retailers to manufacturers, need also to welcome VR into the core of their customer engagement strategies.<\/p>\n<p>This means considering the impacts on the relationship between IT, marketing, sales and service and indeed, HR and recruitment. Getting the virtual experience right may become as much a symptom, of an organisation\u2019s depth of understanding of its audiences and how they want to engage, as a cause of any resulting business value.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As I left the aspirationally named VR World Congress in Bristol, England (We just thought, \u201cLet\u2019s go crazy,\u201d event founder\u00a0Ben Trewhella\u00a0told me&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87746169,"featured_media":949987,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[359256427,359217384],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/949986"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87746169"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=949986"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/949986\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/949987"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=949986"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=949986"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=949986"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":949970,"date":"2016-04-13T05:20:29","date_gmt":"2016-04-13T12:20:29","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=949970"},"modified":"2016-04-13T09:51:33","modified_gmt":"2016-04-13T16:51:33","slug":"three-challenges-the-hardware-industry-faces-in-2016","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/04\/13\/three-challenges-the-hardware-industry-faces-in-2016\/","title":{"rendered":"Three Challenges the Hardware Industry Faces in 2016"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>2016 is the year many thought leaders in tech space are urging caution, expecting markets to cool drastically and urging startups to stay afloat by minimizing burn rate. Yet at the same time, the hardware industry is the fastest growing sector in the market, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.bolt.io\/who-invests-in-hardware-startups-d1612895a31a#.gb7p6gkrt\" target=\"_blank\">with investment up 30x since 2010<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>At this important precipice, what does the future hold for hardware companies? <\/p>\n<p>To better understand where the hardware industry opportunities are, what are perceived as the greatest challenges, and what it means to be a hardware founder today, we surveyed over 200 hardware companies and uncovered a lot of interesting information. Here are the highlights. <\/p>\n<h3>Hardware Companies are Working to Build Products Faster<\/h3>\n<p>In our report, we found on average most companies budget one to three months to build a functional prototype. Similarly, the majority of companies budget just three to six months to go from functional prototype to production. <\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not familiar with hardware development lifecycles, just know that this kind of schedule is incredibly fast (and ambitious) compared with what was possible just five years ago. Hardware startups are increasingly seeking to become leaner in order to get to market faster and maximize capital investment.<\/p>\n<p>But while companies are working hard to be lean and build faster, the outcomes don\u2019t always match expectations. <a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/05\/03\/hardware-crowdfunding-q1-state-of-the-union\/\" target=\"_blank\">Data shows<\/a> that about four out of five VC-backed crowdfunding projects were late in 2014, and of the late projects (total cohort of 91 companies), 30 percent still hadn\u2019t shipped in Q1 2015. <\/p>\n<p>Hardware companies setting ambitious schedules to get to market faster, and that\u2019s fantastic and important, but there are clearly still obstacles in the way preventing companies from building as fast as they\u2019d like to.<\/p>\n<p>What are these obstacles and how can we overcome them? Well, there are many, and I won\u2019t mention them all in this post, but one of the major ones we\u2019re focusing on at <a href=\"http:\/\/fictiv.com\" target=\"_blank\">Fictiv<\/a> is prototyping speed. Iterating on a physical product is inherently slower than iterating on a digital product, but if we can help companies to iterate daily vs weekly, that\u2019s a huge step forward.<\/p>\n<h3>Hardware Companies Seek Access to Better Tools<\/h3>\n<p>One of the key factors that has contributed to massive growth in the hardware sector is an increase in the number of tools available to hardware companies for prototyping and development.<\/p>\n<p>We asked companies which tools they leverage in the development of their products and saw that 91% of companies use 3D printing, 58% use Breadboards, 51% use Arduino, and much more. (Honorable mention goes out to the tried-and-true duct tape, used by 46% of survey takers!)<\/p>\n<p>On the design side of things, there are a large variety of CAD programs available, but according to our results, Solidworks still reigns supreme, used by 70% of our survey takers.<\/p>\n<p>While there\u2019s been a big uptick in the number of tools available, we need to continue to teach a wider audience how to use these tools most effectively. Arduino and Adafruit, for example, are doing a fantastic job educating people on the electronics side, Dragon Innovation is teaching young companies how to work with manufacturers in China, and on our blog we\u2019re educating engineers and designs on how to prototype on the mechanical side of things. <\/p>\n<p>However, access to tools is not enough to make a successful hardware company\u2014we need to document and decodify the knowledge around how to best use these tools and manufacture products at scale.<\/p>\n<h3>Raising Capital is Top of Mind<\/h3>\n<p>We polled companies on the greatest challenge in bringing a successful product to market and 28% said funding &#038; resources was #1.<\/p>\n<p>And they\u2019re not alone\u2014this feeling is being echoed by thought leaders across the venture capital space. For example, Mark Suster, partner at Upfront Ventures, cautions: \u201cI suspect 2016 will be the year that the more heated private tech markets cool.\u201d Similarly, Fred Wilson, co-founder of Union Square Ventures, recently projected that \u201cMarkdown Mania will hit the venture capital sector as VC firms follow Fidelity\u2019s lead and start aggressively taking down the valuations in their portfolios.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In response to VC\u2019s urging caution this year, minimizing burn rate and staying lean is the mantra for hardware startups in 2016.<\/p>\n<p>The good news is that hardware is still the fastest growing sector in the industry and investment has been increasing at astounding rates: Investment in hardware is up 30x since 2010 and venture capital dollars in IoT have gone from $1.8 billion in 2013 to $2.9 billion in 2014 and $3.44 billion in 2015.<\/p>\n<p>To stay lean, hardware companies should consider burn rate and optimize for speed in the prototyping stage of development. Often we see cost-conscious startups skimp on up-front costs rather than considering the cost of wasted time, which ultimately comes down to burn rate (people are your biggest expense). So every time you order a 3D printed part, for example, the true cost of that part is really (part cost + (lead time x daily burn rate)).<\/p>\n<h3>Main Takeaways<\/h3>\n<p>The evidence from our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blog.fictiv.com\/posts\/2016-state-of-hardware-report\" target=\"_blank\">State of Hardware Report<\/a> points toward incredible potential for the hardware industry. More and more companies are building innovative products, we have better tools and technologies for prototyping, and the community is strong and passionate about open-source knowledge. <\/p>\n<p>But we still have a ways to go before hardware development can truly to accessible to everyone. We hope this snapshot of information points the community in the right direction to understand how to make hardware universally accessible so we can continue to build better tools and resources for truly democratized hardware development.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>2016 is the year many thought leaders in tech space are urging caution, expecting markets to cool drastically and urging startups to&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87667310,"featured_media":949979,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[359256420,359231616,359256422,359218424,359228004,240764,359221544,359256421],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/949970"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87667310"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=949970"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/949970\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/949979"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=949970"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=949970"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=949970"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":949956,"date":"2016-04-12T11:13:04","date_gmt":"2016-04-12T18:13:04","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=949956"},"modified":"2016-04-12T11:13:04","modified_gmt":"2016-04-12T18:13:04","slug":"how-biology-is-inspiring-the-next-generation-of-cybersecurity","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/04\/12\/how-biology-is-inspiring-the-next-generation-of-cybersecurity\/","title":{"rendered":"How Biology is Inspiring the Next Generation of Cybersecurity"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Your average security operations center is a very busy place. Analysts sit in rows, staring intently at computer monitors. Cybersecurity alerts tick past onscreen\u2014an average of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.csoonline.com\/article\/2155282\/data-protection\/reining-in-out-of-control-security-alerts.html\" target=\"_blank\">10,000 each day<\/a>. Somehow, the analysts must decide, in seconds, which of these are false alarms, and which might be the next Target hack. Which should be ignored, and which should send them running to the phone to wake up the CIO in the middle of the night.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a difficult job.<\/p>\n<p>The alerts are false alarms the vast majority of the time. Cybersecurity tools have been notoriously bad at separating the signal from the noise. That\u2019s no surprise, since the malware used by hackers is constantly mutating and evolving, just like a living thing. The static signatures that antivirus software uses to detect them are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.webroot.com\/blog\/2012\/02\/23\/why-relying-on-antivirus-signatures-is-simply-not-enough-anymore\/\" target=\"_blank\">outdated almost as soon as they are released<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The problem is that this knowledge can cause a kind of numbness\u2014and make tech teams slow to act when cybersecurity software does uncover a real threat (a problem that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/bw\/articles\/2014-03-13\/target-missed-alarms-in-epic-hack-of-credit-card-data#p1\" target=\"_blank\">may have contributed<\/a> to the Target debacle).<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, a few government labs are experimenting with a new approach\u2014one that starts with taking the \u201cliving\u201d nature of malware a little more seriously. Meet the new generation of biology-inspired cybersecurity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sequencing Malware DNA<\/strong><br \/>\nThe big problem with signature-based threat detection is that even tiny mutations in malware can fool it. Hackers can repackage the same code again and again with only a few small tweaks to change its signature. The process can even be automated. This makes hacking computers cheap, fast, and easy\u2014much more so than defending them.<\/p>\n<p>Margaret Lospinuso, a researcher at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jhuapl.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\">Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Applied Physics Laboratory<\/a> (JHUAPL), was pondering this problem a few years ago when she had a brainstorm. A computer scientist with a lifelong interest in biology, she was aware that programs for matching DNA sequences often had to ignore small discrepancies like this, too. What if she could create a kind of DNA for malware\u2014and then train a computer to read it?<\/p>\n<p>DNA maps out plans for complex proteins using only four letters. But CodeDNA uses a much longer alphabet to represent computer code. Each chunk of code is assigned a \u201cletter\u201d depending on its function\u2014for example, a letter A might represent code that opens a certain type of file, while a letter B might represent code that opens a server connection. Once a suspicious computer program is translated into this type of \u201cDNA,\u201d Lospinuso\u2019s software can then compare to the DNA of known malware to see if there are similarities.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a \u201clossy technique,\u201d says Lospinuso\u2014some of the detail gets scrubbed out in translation. However, that loss of detail makes it easier for CodeDNA to identify similarities between different samples of code, Lospinuso says. \u201cUp close, a stealth bomber and a jumbo jet look pretty different. But in the distance, where details are indistinct, they both just look like planes.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The resulting technique drastically cuts down on the time analysts need to sort and categorize data. According to one commercial cybersecurity analyst, the similarities CodeDNA found in two minutes would have saved him two weeks of hard work. But the biggest advantage of CodeDNA \u00a0is that it won\u2019t be fooled by small tweaks to existing code. Instead of simply repackaging old malware, hackers to build new versions from scratch if they want to escape detection. That makes hacking vastly more time-consuming, expensive, and difficult\u2014exactly how it should be.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to Build a Cyber-Protein<\/strong><br \/>\nLospinuso\u2019s team built CodeDNA\u2019s software from scratch, too; it\u2019s different from standard DNA-matching software, even though they implement the same basic techniques. Not so with MLSTONES, a technology developed at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pnnl.gov\/\" target=\"_blank\">Pacific Northwest National Laboratory<\/a> (PNNL). MLSTONES is essentially a tricked-out version of pBLAST, a public-source software program for deciphering protein sequences. Proteins are constructed from combinations of 20 amino acids, giving their \u201calphabet\u201d more complexity than DNA\u2019s 4-letter one. \u201cThat\u2019s ideal for modeling computer code,\u201d said project lead Elena Peterson.<\/p>\n<p>MLSTONES originally had nothing to do with cybersecurity. It started out as an attempt to speed up pBLAST itself using high-performance computing techniques. \u201cThen we started to think: what if the thing we were analyzing wasn\u2019t a protein, but something else?\u201d Peterson said.<\/p>\n<p>The MLSTONES team got a bit of encouragement early on when their algorithm successfully categorized a previously unknown virus that standard anti-virus software couldn\u2019t identify. \u201cWhen we presented [it] to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.us-cert.gov\/\" target=\"_blank\">US-CERT<\/a>, the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, they confirmed it was a previously unidentified variant of a <a href=\"http:\/\/usa.kaspersky.com\/internet-security-center\/threats\/trojans#.Vm9zwWQrLu0\" target=\"_blank\">Trojan<\/a>. They even let us name it,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cThat was the tipping point for us to continue our research.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Peterson says she is proud of how close MLSTONES remains to its bioinformatics roots. The final version of the program still uses the same <a href=\"http:\/\/cs.stanford.edu\/people\/eroberts\/courses\/soco\/projects\/computers-and-the-hgp\/smith_waterman.html\" target=\"_blank\">database search algorithm<\/a> that is at the heart of pBLAST, but strips out some chemistry and biology bias in the pBLAST software. \u201cIf the letter A means something in chemistry, it has to not mean that anymore,\u201d Peterson says. This agnostic approach also makes MLSTONES extremely flexible, so it can be adapted to uses beyond just tracking malware. A version called LINEBACKER, for instance, applies similar techniques to identify abnormal patterns in network traffic, another key indicator of cyber threats.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A Solution to Mutant Malware<\/strong><br \/>\nCyberattacks are growing faster, cheaper, and more sophisticated. But all too often, the software that stops them isn\u2019t. To secure our data and defend our networks, we need security solutions that adapt as fast as threats do, catching mutated malware that most current methods would miss. The biology-based approach of CodeDNA and MLSTONES isn\u2019t just a step in the right direction here\u2014it\u2019s a huge leap.

However, few consider the security implications of conducting meetings over internet connected devices and may be leaving themselves open to eavesdroppers at best, corporate espionage at worst.<\/p>\n<p>Those technologies, which include, VoIP, Videoconferencing, hosted webinars, and IP based communications platforms have transformed the way businesses communicate; Creating a paradigm shift that has resulted in the creation of the virtual meeting place \/ virtual conference room. Yet, for all of the productivity created, a deep dark secret lingers in the shadows \u2013 a secret that can be summed up simply as who can eavesdrop on those virtual meetings, or intercept the data shared.<\/p>\n<p>That secret culminates in to a real world threat, where the specter of corporate espionage, powered by IP based communications, can result in loss revenue and failed projects. Simply put, securing all forms of communication should a major concern for any business entity looking to share confidential data or discuss intellectual property across the unfettered packets flying across the internet.<\/p>\n<p>After all, businesses spend countless dollars on firewalls, security appliances and other InfoSec technologies to protect files and prevent unauthorized access to corporate systems, yet it seems little thought is put into securing technologies that have become all too common, such as videoconferencing and hosted IP based conferencing platforms.<\/p>\n<p>To be effective, IP based conferencing has to be easy to use, easy to access and flexible enough to be reconfigured on the fly. What\u2019s more, conferencing must be able to work across several different devices, ranging from smart phones to desktop PCs to dedicated IP conference room appliances. Simply put, if the platform makes things difficult for users, those users will attempt to go another route, such as an open or \u201cfree\u201d system, further complicating the security picture.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Therein lies the security conundrum of virtual meetings. How can IT professionals make it both easy to use and secure from data leakage?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The answer to that conundrum lies with rethinking how users engage with their meeting platforms of choice. In other words, a conferencing system has to be both easy to use and easy to secure, two elements are normally at polar opposites of the communications equation.<\/p>\n<p>To that end, Video Conferencing Solutions Vendor <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pexip.com\">pexip<\/a> has launched Infinity, a hosted platform that combines ease of use with policy based enforcement to create secure virtual meeting rooms. The product accomplishes that by leveraging an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pexip.com\/article\/blog\/pexip-infinity-external-policy-servers\">external policy server<\/a>, which allows administrators to define policies that enforce security rules based upon multiple factors, such as user identity, location, device and so forth.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, establishing identity is only the first part of the security equation. Here, pexip brings to the table some additional capabilities, such as assigning a temporary PIN to a particular meeting and then delivering that PIN via an RSA token, SMS, or other methodology so that two factor authentication becomes the norm for any conference.<\/p>\n<p>For example, with SMS, each time the policy server receives a meeting request, a dynamic PIN is generated (which is stored for 60 seconds), that PIN is then delivered to the meeting attendee using their assigned phone number, which the policy server can loop up in the directory. The attendee uses that pin as a part of the authentication to enter the meeting.<\/p>\n<p>There is a lesson to be learned here, security ideologies must flow down to even the most basic of corporate communications.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Businesses large and small have turned to VoiP, Videoconferencing and many other IP enabled communications platforms to enhance collaboration and speed the&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8020068,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[201327107,359256419,359216144],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/949967"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8020068"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=949967"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/949967\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=949967"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=949967"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=949967"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":949963,"date":"2016-04-11T03:37:21","date_gmt":"2016-04-11T10:37:21","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=949963"},"modified":"2016-04-11T03:45:05","modified_gmt":"2016-04-11T10:45:05","slug":"why-adopt-a-mobile-first-development-strategy","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/04\/11\/why-adopt-a-mobile-first-development-strategy\/","title":{"rendered":"Why adopt a mobile-first development strategy?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cWe think mobile first,\u201d stated Macy\u2019s chief financial officer Karen Hoguet, in a recent <a href=\"http:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/article\/3920826-macys-m-q4-2015-results-earnings-call-transcript\">earnings call<\/a> with financial analysts.<\/p>\n<p>A quick glance at the US department store chain\u2019s 2015 financial results explains why mobile technologies might be occupying minds and getting top priority there. Sales made by shoppers over mobile devices were a definite bright spot in an otherwise disappointing year for the company. Mobile revenues more than doubled, in fact, thanks to big increases in the number of shoppers using smartphones and tablets not only to browse, but also to buy.<\/p>\n<p>So it\u2019s no surprise that Macy\u2019s hopes to maintain this trend, by continuing to improve the mobile experience it offers. In the year ahead, Hoguet explained, this \u2018mobile first\u2019 mindset will see Macy\u2019s add new filters to search capabilities, clean up interfaces and fast-track the purchase process for mobile audiences.<\/p>\n<p>Other consumer-focused organisations are thinking the same way and the phrase \u2018mobile first\u2019 has become something of a mantra for many. One of its earliest high-profile mentions came way back in 2010, in a keynote given by Eric Schmidt, the-then Google CEO (and now Alphabet executive chairman), at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe understand that the new rule is \u2018mobile first\u2019,\u201d he told attendees. \u201cMobile first in everything. Mobile first in terms of applications. Mobile first in terms of the way people use things.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The trouble is that, for in-house development teams, a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/SamsungBusinessUSA\/a-mobile-first-strategy-gartner-session\">mobile-first strategy<\/a> still represents something of a diversion from standard practice. They\u2019re more accustomed to developing \u2018full size\u2019 websites for PCs and laptops first, and then shrinking these down to fit the size, navigation and processing-power limitations posed by mobile devices.<\/p>\n<p>The risk here is that what they end up with looks like exactly what it is: a watered-down afterthought, packing a much weaker punch than its designed-for-desktop parent.<\/p>\n<p>A development team that has adopted a mobile-first strategy, by contrast, will start by developing a site for mobile that looks good and works well on small form factors, and then \u2018work their way up\u2019 to larger devices, adding extra content and functions as they go.<\/p>\n<p>That approach will make more and more sense as more \u2018smart\u2019 devices come online and the desktop PC becomes an increasingly minor character in our day-to-day lives. Take wearables, for example: many CIOs believe that headsets, wrist-mounted devices and the like hold the key to providing workers with relevant, contextual information as and when they need it, whether they\u2019re up a ladder in a warehouse or driving a delivery van.<\/p>\n<p>Developing apps for these types of devices present many of the same challenges associated with smartphones and tablets: minimal screen real estate, limited processing power and the need to integrate with third-party plug-ins and back-end corporate systems. Then there\u2019s a lack of standardised platform for wearables to consider, meaning that developers may be required to adapt their mobile app to run on numerous different devices. For many, it may be better to get that hard work out of the way at the very start of a project.<\/p>\n<p>In a recent <a href=\"http:\/\/www.developer-tech.com\/news\/2016\/mar\/02\/research-insights-state-app-developers-2016\/\">survey<\/a> of over 1,000 mobile developers conducted by InMobi, only 6% of respondents said they had created apps for wearables, but 32% believe they\u2019re likely to do so in future.<\/p>\n<p>The same rules apply to a broader category of meters and gadgets that make up the Internet of Things, from meters for measuring gas flow in a utilities network, to products for \u2018smart homes\u2019, such as the <a href=\"https:\/\/canary.is\/\">Canary<\/a> home-monitoring device, to virtual reality headsets, such as Samsung\u2019s Gear VR, as worn by attendees at Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/parmyolson\/2016\/02\/22\/mark-zuckerberg-virtual-reality-samsung-galaxy-s7\/\">keynote<\/a> at this year\u2019s MWC.<\/p>\n<p>As the population of \u2018alternative\u2019 computing devices grows, developers will begin with a lean, mean mobile app, which functions well despite the constraints of the platform on which it runs, having made all the tough decisions about content and function upfront. Then, having exercised some discipline and restraint, they\u2019ll get all the fun of building on top of it, to create a richer experience for desktop devices.<\/p>\n<p>More importantly, they\u2019ll be building for the devices that consumers more regularly turn to when they want to be informed, entertained or make a purchase. In the US, digital media time (or in other words, Internet usage) on mobile is now significantly higher at 51% than on desktop (42%), according to last year\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/kleinerperkins\/internet-trends-v1\">Global Internet Trends Report<\/a> by Mary Meeker of Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers (KPCB).<\/p>\n<p>In other words, developers should go mobile first, because that\u2019s what we consumers increasingly do.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Picture Credit:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/euwars\">Farzad Nazifi<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cWe think mobile first,\u201d stated Macy\u2019s chief financial officer Karen Hoguet, in a recent earnings call with financial analysts.

It is excerpted from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1119190754\/\">Not Everyone Gets a Trophy: How to Manage the Millennials<\/a><\/em> by <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/contributor\/bruce-tulgan\/\">Bruce Tulgan<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>A senior private equity managing director told me of a parent calling to complain that her son was working too many hours. I asked how he reacted to this call. \u201cI just listened and tried to be polite. I didn\u2019t tell her that her son was going to make ten thousand dollars less for every minute she kept me on the phone. But I did the math in my head.\u201d He went on, \u201cThis is ridiculous. For one thing, my parents never in a million years would have considered calling my boss when I was in my first job out of college. I can\u2019t even imagine that. They didn\u2019t even know my boss\u2019s name. And I would have been mortified if my boss got a call from my parents.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s become almost clich\u00e9 to say that the Millennial generation is over-parented. But they are. And that is a fact with which managers today must grapple. \u201cThis is an outrage,\u201d some managers say, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to deal with their parents at all.\u201d On the flip side, some managers simply accept that their young employees will be accompanied and assisted by their parents throughout the early stages of their working lives. I don\u2019t think you should accept that. You hired the employee, not the parents. But you do have to deal with it.<\/p>\n<p>One nurse manager on a very busy hospital floor told me, \u201cMy approach is simple: sink-or-swim time now, kids. Just let the real world sort them out.\u201d The problem is that if you take a sink-or-swim approach with Millennial employees, they are likely to sink; or go to the shallow end and play; or swim off in their own direction; or get out of the pool, walk across the street, and go work for your competition. And when you hire a replacement, that person is likely to bring his or her parents along too. The irony is that if you hire a Millennial who is not close to his or her parents, you may be sorry. Among today\u2019s young workers, those who are closest to their parents will probably turn out to be the most able, most achievement oriented, and the hardest working.<\/p>\n<p>In my seminars, I tell managers that the way to deal with the over-parenting problem is to take a strong hand as a manager, not a weak one. Your Millennial employees need to know that you know who they are and care about their success. You need to make it a priority to spend time with them. Guide them through this very difficult and scary world. Break things down for them like a teacher. Provide regular, gentle course corrections to keep them on track. Be honest with them so you can help them improve. Keep close track of their successes no matter how small. Reward the behavior you want and need to see, and even negotiate special rewards for above-and-beyond performance in very small increments along the way.<\/p>\n<p>When I describe this approach at seminars, at least one manager will remark, \u201cThis sounds a lot like parenting. Are you saying that we should manage these young upstarts as if we are their parents?\u201d I\u2019m afraid the answer I\u2019ve come to is yes, at least sort of. Let\u2019s put it this way. You can\u2019t fight the over-parenting phenomenon, so run with it. Your Millennial employees want it. They need it. Without strong management in the workplace, there is a void where their parents have always been. Step into the void. Take over the tutoring aspects of the parental role in the workplace without taking over the emotional part (at least mostly).<\/p>\n<p>Do be careful, and don\u2019t get carried away. The worst thing you can possibly do with Millennials is treat them like children, talk down to them, or make them feel disrespected. Millennials are used to being treated as valued members of the family, whose thoughts and feelings are important.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, Millennials have gotten more respect from their parents and elders than any other generation in history.<\/p>\n<p>I call this approach \u2018in loco parentis management.\u2019 In loco parentis, a Latin term that means \u201cin the place of a parent,\u201d typically is used to refer to the position of an institution (usually a school) charged with the care of a minor in the absence of the minor\u2019s parent. Here\u2019s what this means:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Care about your young employees.<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t pretend to be their best friend.<\/li>\n<li>Give them boundaries and structure.<\/li>\n<li>Help them keep score.<\/li>\n<li>Negotiate special rewards in very small increments.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<hr \/>\n<h3><strong>About the Author<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Bruce Tulgan is an adviser to business leaders all over the world and a sought-after keynote speaker and seminar leader.

Then I took on sales-and-marketing startup <a href=\"http:\/\/agilecrm.com\">Agile CRM<\/a> as a content strategy client. Being a part of cloud-based app\u2019s core team since before Agile CRM\u2019s public beta launch has completely changed my opinion on bootstrapping, and not just because we passed the sacred seven-figure revenue mark last year.<\/p>\n<p>I used to see investors and VC firms as market soothsayers, as if they somehow understood business better than the businesses themselves. Now I know that bootstrapping builds better SaaS apps. Here\u2019s why.<\/p>\n<h3>Pitching Customers Instead of Investors<\/h3>\n<p>With a bootstrapped SaaS app, you pitch your customers instead of investors. And guess what? You pitch them every day. That daily engagement and interchange that enable bolder innovation, from the app to the marketplace and back again.<\/p>\n<p>When I first started working with the Agile team, we were our own best customer, if only because we were the only customer. The core development team had designed the first version of the app to solve immediate, real-world problems faced by their first SaaS app, ClickDesk, when it started scaling at an unprecedented rate. They couldn\u2019t find a single affordable, extensible, integrated option for sales and marketing automation to track lead behavior and engage contacts throughout the entire customer lifecycle. Fed up with overpriced software that seemed to be aimed only at enterprise users with unlimited budgets, they decided to build a solution themselves and voila, Agile was born. It was just an internal solution at first, but that would soon change.<\/p>\n<p>In my opinion, the most innovative part of founder Manohar Chapalamadugu\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/yourstory.com\/2015\/09\/million-dollar-saas-company\/\">million-dollar vision<\/a> in leading Agile CRM (and this was there from the very beginning) has been his emphasis on building an all-in-one solution focused on sales and marketing processes, rather than just standalone features. It\u2019s a bold vision, encompassing everything from call automation and online scheduling to sales gamification and automated email nurturing. With the decision to bootstrap growth from the beginning, input about these processes has continued to come directly from customers.<\/p>\n<p>Something special happens when you daily pitch customers and listen closely to their response. Agile now has almost <a href=\"http:\/\/agilecrmcom.uservoice.com\/\">1,300 ideas<\/a> posted by customers on UserVoice, with over 200 of those ideas completed or in progress. If the CRM had taken outside investment, I think it\u2019s unlikely that features such as the in-app landing page builder with integrated lead magnets would have been able to evolve naturally on top of an already extensive feature set. There would have been too many constraints.<\/p>\n<h3>An Ongoing Conversation<\/h3>\n<p>Technically-skilled support staff are one of the core reasons that bootstrapped SaaS companies create better products in the long run. Many of Agile\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.agilecrm.com\/testimonials\">customer testimonials<\/a> speak of real campaigns and successes, and those quotes come not from anonymous review websites but from actual conversations with team members in India.<\/p>\n<p>A brief word of advice. Whether you call them customer success agents, sales support staff, customer happiness rockstars, or a new title we haven\u2019t even heard yet, let me emphasize two things: 1) They need to understand customer wants and needs (ie. it\u2019s better to have one technically-skilled success agent than three with limited knowledge or experience of the actual product and industry); and 2) They should be some of your first hires. Just because you\u2019re bootstrapping, that doesn\u2019t mean you should skimp on support. In fact, the opposite is true.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been continually impressed by the dedication and responsiveness of Agile\u2019s sales and support staff to customer wants and needs, and as I\u2019ve learned more about bootstrapped companies with exceedingly high customer satisfaction ratings, I\u2019ve noticed that this dedication to customer success goes hand-in-hand with smart bootstrapping. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aha.io\/\">Aha!<\/a>, the (totally bootstrapped) visual roadmapping app for product managers, stands out in particular with their decision to <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.aha.io\/index.php\/why-customers-success-means-the-end-of-salespeople\/\">forego salespeople in favor of customer success<\/a>.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/03\/minimum-lovable-product-aha.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-949933\"><img src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/03\/minimum-lovable-product-aha.jpg\" alt=\"minimum-lovable-product-aha\" width=\"638\" height=\"479\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-949933\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/03\/minimum-lovable-product-aha.jpg 638w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/03\/minimum-lovable-product-aha-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/03\/minimum-lovable-product-aha-186x140.jpg 186w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/03\/minimum-lovable-product-aha-33x25.jpg 33w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/03\/minimum-lovable-product-aha-320x240.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px\" \/><\/a>\n<h3>Failure is the Ultimate Motivation<\/h3>\n<p>Bootstrapping a SaaS app isn\u2019t about the choice between having weekly investor calls (or shareholder meetings) or weekly calls with your early adopters. It\u2019s bigger than that. As Ryan Shank of (totally bootstrapped) <a href=\"http:\/\/mhelpdesk.com\/\">mHelpDesk<\/a> has written, bootstrapping is about building \u201can empire&#8230;one customer at a time.\u201d We\u2019ve already discussed the importance of customers. Now let\u2019s shift focus to that idea of building \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/03\/25\/bootstrapping-is-the-new-seed\/\">an empire<\/a>.\u201d The problem with empires is that eventually most of them fail.<\/p>\n<p>Once a SaaS company decides to bootstrap their own growth, there\u2019s a shift in perception regarding their own product. Maybe this is true for other types of apps, too, but with software-as-a-service I\u2019ve noticed that the shift is much more dramatic, maybe because the rate of micro-focused iteration is so high, as are the possibilities for large-scale changes, both on the front and back ends of your product. It\u2019s terrifying, but it\u2019s also exhilarating. Updates happen automatically and customers are instantly engaged with them.<\/p>\n<p>Bootstrapped SaaS apps can create more dynamic products because (if they\u2019re successful) they embrace the possibility of failure, using it as motivation for streamlining their product and constantly making small enhancements, too, such as cleaning up front-end code and improving speed in as many ways as possible, like for one particular feature in one particular mobile browser. As Shank notes, having a smaller amount of cash on hand also demands a certain discipline and focus. How will you use that money? Will you build an app customers love, or will you create another pitch deck for investors?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I used to think bootstrapping was unsustainable, then a client in the cloud changed my mind.

The 1968 story by <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">British Poet Laureate<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Ted Hughes<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> presents one of the archetypal intersections of technology and humanity. It was science fiction then but, in the near fifty years that have since passed, the delta between tech and humans has narrowed. Today we live in a world where technology is closing in on what may be our most complex asset: emotion. And while the long-term impact unleashes a provocative range of possibilities, the more immediate effects are starting to be seen in customer engagement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Emotion isn\u2019t a new frontier in business, of course; sentiment analysis and emotional branding have been in practice long before they were formalized. Focus groups date at least as far back as World War II and <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mad Men<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> fans will likely recall Draper\u2019s tryst with consumer-research (and consultant Faye Miller\u2026) And, of course, as the 20th century progressed, technology joined customer insight\u2019s analog tool sets. But it\u2019s only more recently that tech-powered emotional analytics have really stepped into the spotlight. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What\u2019s driving tech\u2019s emo pursuits? <\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">re is a certain inevitability to it all; for years now, artificial intelligence has made its way into countless sci-fi narratives, laying out a trajectory of sorts for innovation. But a more practical driving factor is the business case\u2014the seismic shift in consumer behavior (thanks largely to on-demand content and mobile devices) has challenged brands by turning neatly defined channels and dayparts into an always-on free for all. \u00a0And while the ability to reach consumers anywhere\/anytime sounds compelling on the surface, try accessing a highway without a designated on ramp. Without a construct for <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">when<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to engage consumers, you need to be a lot smarter about making your move. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How is it done?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fortunately, the same innovations that have muddied the waters of engagement offer a path to clarity. Mobile devices\u2014the digital appendages that we eat, sleep and everything with\u2014offer data on consumer needs, wants and, increasingly, emotions, all of which can be leveraged for targeting and overall strategy. <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.microsoft.com\/next\/2015\/11\/11\/happy-sad-angry-this-microsoft-tool-recognizes-emotions-in-pictures\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Microsoft\u2019s Project Oxford<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2019s work, along with <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/apple-buys-artificial-intelligence-startup-emotient-1452188715\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Apple\u2019s<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> recent acquisition of Emotient, have triggered recent buzz around facial recognition technology, while <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/adexchanger.com\/digital-tv\/mediacom-gauges-emotional-impact-video-ads\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">MediaCom\u2019s announcement<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> that they would use emotional tracking via <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">facial detection in planning suggests that this is more than buzz. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are also a growing number of offerings that use biometric feedback (like body temperature, sweat and heart rate) to gauge emotional response. Innerscope Research and Lightwave offer such technology, the latter recently partnered with 20th Century Fox to measure emotional reactions to <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Revenant. <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Biometric data was also (not surprisingly) a topic of discussion at SXSW, with companies like Under Armour, Microsoft and Samsung <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">coming together to discuss <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mediapost.com\/publications\/article\/271068\/wearable-data-gives-marketers-that-real-time-conne.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">how it can be used to make marketing smarter<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>It\u2019s an insight upgrade for marketers<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The data available through these various technologies isn\u2019t simply a <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">substitute<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> for the traditional practice of marketing-by-assumption\u2014it transcends it by providing marketers with a much more granular and actionable set of insights with which to make marketing decisions. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Further, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">what\u2019s different today than say, 20 years ago, is that the same sort of technology that powers martech platforms is also available in consumer products. Smartwatches and <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/mashable.com\/2016\/01\/12\/feel-emotion-tracker-wearable\/#VxZ9m9v54OqJ\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">fitness wristbands<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/1\/4\/10706994\/omsignal-ces-2016-new-biometric-fitness-tracking-smart-bra\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">bras<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> are opening the door to a more emotionally-aware exchange between consumers and brands. As the technology proliferates, marketers have the opportunity to gain real-time insight into consumer\u2019s emotional state at scale. (Focus groups start looking quaint, don\u2019t they?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Is it too creepy?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The response to this question often hinges on the value exchange\u2014in other words, consumers are more likely to share information when they get something of value out of it. In the case of emotion tracking, the marketer\u2019s endgame is to deliver more relevant and effective engagement opportunities by presenting messages or experiences that fit a specific moment and emotional mindset. As advertising becomes more attuned and responsive to consumer needs\u2014offering information and utility instead of just taglines\u2014it may evolve into something that feels more like a service than an imposition. (This can already be seen in mobile ads that offer features like store finders.) If it\u2019s handled correctly on the brand, publisher and technology side (that is, with transparency), then the value exchange can work in the consumer\u2019s favor. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Of course, there are benefits beyond marketing, too. Samsung\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/news.samsung.com\/global\/samsung-introduces-look-at-me-app-to-help-children-with-autism-communicate-better\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Look at Me<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> app is designed to help autistic children improve communication skills by, in part, helping them decode emotions, while the recent <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.adweek.com\/adfreak\/samsung-vr-headsets-help-millennials-overcome-their-fears-persuasive-new-ads-169949\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Be Fearless campaign<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> showcases the ability to use virtual reality technology to cure phobias. Similarly, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/vhil.stanford.edu\/news\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Stanford\u2019s Virtual Human Interactions Lab<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is exploring virtual reality\u2019s potential for building empathy. A number of similar programs are in use by the likes of the UN and Amnesty International. In other words, there are a lot of feel-good things happening in the world of emo-tech. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What next? <\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What does the future look like for a world where technology is attuned to our emotions? From a customer engagement perspective, emotional analytics enables clearer insight into consumer needs and general receptivity. Giving marketers the ability to make smarter decisions about how and when they engage consumers can have a positive impact on the relationship between brands and consumers, which is timely given the tension around ad blocking and oversaturation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It\u2019s also becoming easy to imagine a world where the information exchanged via, for example, wearables makes it possible to skip that intermediary message and allow brands to instantly respond to a current emotional need. Imagine getting a serotonin boost from your earbuds while riding the hyperloop to a lunch meeting in San Francisco? (This opens up a longer tangent about opting in, which we can save for another conversation.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Despite great strides in emotional analytics, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">marketers are still in the discovery phase\u2014learning what data is available and figuring out how to most effectively interpret and act on that data. So, there\u2019s still a way to go before we reach many of the possibilities. And, along that way, a fair amount of trust needs to be in place for emotional analytics to be effective. That\u2019s trust in brand, of course, but also in technology. Consumers need to see that tech can interpret complex emotions with reasonable accuracy and then, based on that insight, take the most favorable action\u2014whether it be delivering the most relevant brand message or, well, saving us from an atomic bomb. You know, the simple stuff.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There\u2019s a soul-crushing moment in The Iron Giant when [spoiler alert] the alien robot chooses to save humans from an atomic bomb.&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87833663,"featured_media":949868,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[359219508,359216066,359216901,11453,359215995,12374,359223158,359256395,359256396,41100,359217153,359232338,8668,64818,359256398,96976,175,359220492,359216088,359215952,359256358,359256397,359215905,200883099,18949,33644298,359218683],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/949866"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87833663"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=949866"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/949866\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/949868"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=949866"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=949866"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=949866"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":949849,"date":"2016-03-25T07:11:46","date_gmt":"2016-03-25T14:11:46","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=949849"},"modified":"2016-03-28T13:43:46","modified_gmt":"2016-03-28T20:43:46","slug":"problems-with-email-integration-for-work-management-tools","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/03\/25\/problems-with-email-integration-for-work-management-tools\/","title":{"rendered":"Problems with email integration for work management tools"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019ve been evaluating a long list of work management tools as part of the research for the Work Management Narrative report (see recent post, <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/03\/24\/work-management-in-theory-context\/\">Work Management in Theory: Context<\/a>). One issue that comes up a great deal is the integration with email, which is a common trigger for a user to create a task, as well as a means to communicate with other team members who may not be using the same \u2014 or any \u2014 work management tools.<\/p>\n<p>This post doesn\u2019t look into how work management tools use email as a way to communicate with team member not using the work management tool: that\u2019s a separate use case. I\u2019m focusing on email as a parallel sort of communication, and one from which a great deal of tasks arise.<\/p>\n<p>There are a number of approaches to email integration, which I will categorize like this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Low or no integration: despite the ubiquity of email, and the obvious need to communicate to the wide, wide world through it (and email\u2019s insatiable hunger to communicate with us, too) some vendors offer little or no support for the realities of email. Not good.<\/li>\n<li>Loose integration: some vendors have opted for a loose integration, often through bookmarklets or third-party connection services like <a href=\"https:\/\/zapier.com\/\">Zapier<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/ifttt.com\">IFTTT<\/a>. For example, Azendoo supports a Zapier \u2018zap\u2019 where gmails that I star become tasks in a specific project. Subsequently, the user can open Azendoo, and perhaps move the task to another project, add notes, fool with metadata (due dates, assignment, etc.). A bookmarklet \u2014 like Wrike\u2018s \u2014 accomplishes more or less the same thing. In either case, the connection is one-way, and the work management tool does not try to \u2018handle\u2019 email in a general way: the precipitating email is just a starting point for a task. At present, I think loose integration is the best approach.<\/li>\n<li>In-inbox integration: Some solutions \u2014 like Todoist (a team task management tool) and Sortd (ditto) \u2014 provide a Google Chrome extension so that when you are \u2018in\u2019 Gmail you can easily convert an email to a task (and add metadata, etc.) in a window while never leaving the Gmail context. This is a lot smoother than loose integration, especially for people who communicate through email a great deal. Also, clicking on a link back to an email makes it more of a two way solution.<\/li>\n<li>In-app email: Some tools aspire to replace the email client\u2019s functionality altogether, basically pulling in all emails and implementing the services that emulate \u2014 at least in part \u2014 capabilities of email services. It is this last case that I want to zoom into in this post.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I\u2019ve tried at least two solutions in recent weeks that seek to bring email integration in-app: <a href=\"http:\/\/fleep.io\/\">Fleep<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/scribblepost.com\/\">ScribblePost<\/a>. I had an exchange with the CEO of ScribblePost, Alon Novy, about his company\u2019s model of email integration. One outcome was the following post, shared with him through the company\u2019s support system. In that post I suggested a more sophisticated version of in-app email integration:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Alon \u2013<\/p>\n<p>I tried and rejected your competitor Fleep\u2019s attempt to act as a email client.<\/p>\n<p>The hybrid failed for some of the same issues I have with your approach:<\/p>\n<p>1. I might have a number of other plugins or features that operate in the Gmail client that I can\u2019t walk away from, like Google Tabs.\n<\/p>\n<p>2. If I have to undertake email hygiene in both Gmail and in the work management tool, that is an impossible cost.\n<\/p>\n<p>3. The design of an email client is distinct from that of a work management tool, and intended to meet a wide range of use cases, not just those related to work management.\n<\/p>\n<p>My bet is that the best approach will be to have a close coupling, but not a full integration of email in the work management tool, like your SP [ScribblePost]. On the work management side, some emails \u2014 those that are starred, or labeled in a specific way \u2014 would have a handle created, so that the email can be indirectly referenced and annotated: for example, comments can be added to the handle, or a task can be created as a follow-up to the email that would be attached to link to the email handle.<\/p>\n<p>I think that the email handle is a distinct type or object in the work management space, different from tasks, internal messages, and posts. An email handle is a specific example of a general notion: a handle to reference some info object principally or partially managed outside the work management solution. That could also hold for Twitter or Facebook messages, for example, or Salesforce contacts.<\/p>\n<p>At any rate, SP could implement a set of actions for email handles that fall into two groups:<\/p>\n<p>1. those that represent actions on the handle \u2014 like creating or deleting the handle, linking it to a task (as a special sort of attachment), sharing it, adding comments, moving a handle from one project to another, etc. \u2014 as opposed to\n<\/p>\n<p>2. actions on the email linked to the handle \u2014 like reply, forward, archive, and so on.\n<\/p>\n<p>I think such a two-faced approach covers the greatest number of use cases, including unforeseen ones.<\/p>\n<p>You might also benefit from a chrome plugin for Gmail, so that some (or perhaps even all) actions that users might want to perform vis-\u00e0-vis the intersection of email and SP could happen \u2018in\u2019 Gmail. For example, I might read an email and decide to\n<\/p>\n<p>1. start tracking this thread in SP,\n<\/p>\n<p>2. associate one or more tags with the handle, and\n<\/p>\n<p>3.assign a follow-up task to myself referencing the email along with some notes.<\/p>\n<p>I could then get back to other email, some of which never crosses over into SP.<\/p>\n<p>Best,<\/p>\n<p>Stowe<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Note that the info handle concept lines up fairly directly with a platform play, obviously.<\/p>\n<p>I applaud Alon and his team for the innovative ideas they are developing in ScribblePost, and likewise the brilliant design of Fleep, both products which I will be reviewing in the upcoming Narrative. I\u2019m sharing this to stimulate discussion around these ideas, and also (shameless plug) to demonstrate the sort of thinking that animates the report.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019ve been evaluating a long list of work management tools as part of the research for the Work Management Narrative report (see&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2184122,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[359256391,163,359222718,359216162,359225941,359256392,359256393,404489,359235539,797071,359256390,359220983],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/949849"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2184122"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=949849"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/949849\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=949849"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=949849"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=949849"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":949842,"date":"2016-03-24T11:51:38","date_gmt":"2016-03-24T18:51:38","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=949842"},"modified":"2016-03-24T11:56:44","modified_gmt":"2016-03-24T18:56:44","slug":"work-management-in-theory-context","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/03\/24\/work-management-in-theory-context\/","title":{"rendered":"Work Management in Theory: Context"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><em>This is an excerpt of the upcoming report,\u00a0<strong>Work Management Narrative<\/strong>, in which I will be reviewing around a dozen products, including\u00a0<strong>Asana, Azendoo, Basecamp, Clarizen, Fleep, Flow, Liquid Planner, Mavenlink, Smartsheet,\u00a0Trello, Work Front, Wrike, Zoho Projects<\/strong> and others.<\/em><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>Work Management in Theory: Context<\/h3>\n<p><b>Work management<\/b> is a term that has emerged in recent years as <b>task management<\/b> tools were enhanced with various social communication capabilities, principally derived from design motifs from <b>work media<\/b> tools.

So, in many instances, groups or companies evaluating tools for team cooperation may consider offerings that are very different in their underlying design, and require correspondingly different approaches to their use.<\/span>The primary distinction here is the degree of emphasis for task-centric versus message-centric tools. Those that we will focus on in this report are <b>task-centric<\/b>, even though there have to include some fundamental level of social communication to be considered work management tools. So for example, <b>Todoist<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a leading<\/span><b> team task management<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tool, widely used in business. However, the tool lacks social communication aside from comments (\u2018notes\u2019) associated with tasks: Todoist does not support messaging, discussions, <\/span><b>activity streams<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or \u2018<\/span><b>call outs<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2019 (also called \u2018<\/span><b>@mentions<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2019). While tasks can be assigned to others by the task creator, there is no other way that users can reference each other, or \u2018talk\u2019. And at the least social level of task management, personal task management tools don\u2019t allow even the most basic level of business-oriented task assignment. As a result, team task management tools are not covered in this report, although Gigaom may develop a report like this one for that market, at some time in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Work management tools share a lot of similarities with various message-centric work technologies. Note that I have divided the message-centric tools into two sorts:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Follow centric<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8212; like <\/span><b>Yammer<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, where the primary orientation of messaging is around following of message sources, and messages are primarily displayed in activity streams based on the user choosing who and what to follow.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Chat centric<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8212; such as <\/span><b>Slack<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, where the primary orientation of message is around chat rooms, or channels, and messages are principally displayed in those contexts when the user chooses to\u2019 join\u2019 or \u2018enter\u2019 them.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some work media tools provide a degree of \u00a0task management, although it may not be the primary focus of the tool. And, as a general case, products like <\/span><b>Jive<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><b>Yammer<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and <\/span><b>IBM Connections<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have little or no native task management, relying instead on integration with third party solutions. Likewise, many leading work chat offerings, like <\/span><b>Slack<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><b>Hipchat<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, don\u2019t have native task management, also relying instead on integration with task management tools, like <\/span><b>Asana<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><b>Jira<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, the class of tools I refer to as <\/span><b>workforce communications<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (like <\/span><b>Lua<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><b>Avaamo<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><b>Fieldwire<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and <\/span><b>Sitrion One<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) have characteristics that are like those of work media and work chat tools, but are principally oriented toward communications management with an increasingly mobile contingent of the out-of-office \u2018hard\u2019<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> workforce, such as construction, retail and restaurant workers, field sales, security, and others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the bottom tier of the table in figure 1 are tools that are not principally oriented toward business use, like personal task management (<\/span><b>Todoist<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and <\/span><b>Google Tasks<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), social media (<\/span><b>Facebook<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and <\/span><b>Twitter<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), and consumer chat apps (<\/span><b>Facebook M<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and <\/span><b>WhatsApp<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). This are widely used in business contexts, although they aren\u2019t geared for it. Note however that this doesn\u2019t mean that they couldn\u2019t be recast as team or work oriented tools, like the trajectory of <\/span><b>Facebook for Work<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are other less-closely related work technologies that are also not investigated here, like <\/span><b>curation<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tools, <\/span><b>conferencing<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tools, and so called <\/span><b>\u2018productivity\u2019<\/b><b> tools<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (like <\/span><b>Microsoft Office 365<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><b>Dropbox Paper<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and <\/span><b>Google Docs\/Sheets\/Slides<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">).

What was your motivation? Was there an itch you just couldn&#8217;t scratch? Does the world need another tech conference?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Byron Reese:<\/strong> Gigaom Change is something entirely new and different. There isn\u2019t another conference quite like it. It is based on the idea that a series of technologies are all converging on us at the same time, and they promise to a cataclysmic impact on the world. \u00a0The seven technologies we will be looking at are artificial intelligence, virtual reality\/augmented reality, robotics, human-machine interfaces, nanotechnology, cybersecurity, and 3D printing.<\/p>\n<p>I have noticed that business leaders everywhere are having trouble keeping up with these technologies. \u00a0Everyone knows the high-level basic concepts, but this growing complexity is strangling corporate foresight and slowing business productivity.<\/p>\n<p>If you think about it, it is no surprise that these technologies are so overwhelming. Humanity has only faced real change three times in the past: When we got speech 100,000 years ago, when we developed agriculture 10,000 years ago, and when we invented writing 5000 years ago. We are literally going to witness the fourth major change, when our technologies upend our society and its institutions. \u00a0Business leaders need to understand how to use these new technologies.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SB:<\/strong> The event will be covering a broad range of topics, so how will that done? Seven parallel tracks? What\u2019s the experience going to be like?<\/p>\n<p><strong>BR:<\/strong> Gigaom Change is a single track event broken up into seven sections over two days. So all the attendees have the same conference experience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SB:<\/strong> How does Gigaom Change articulate with Gigaom&#8217;s research focus?<\/p>\n<p><strong>BR:<\/strong> Gigaom\u2019s research focus is exactly that: Helping our audience of executives understand the technologies they are confronted with. There are all kinds of research organizations covering the consumer space, there are plenty covering marketing departments and IT departments, but our unique focus \u00a0is serving business leaders confronted with the implications of emerging technologies on their business.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SB:<\/strong> What should attendees anticipate as the takeaways from the event?<\/p>\n<p><strong>BR:<\/strong> Gigaom Change is being built in such a way that we can dive into these seven technologies and understand three things about each one: 1) How we got to where we are, 2) How these technologies can be deployed today, and 3) Where it is all heading.<\/p>\n<p>The intent to give leaders the most practical yet thoughtful insight into why these technologies matter and the very tangible impact they will have, collectively, on their business, their industry and the society of which we are all a part.<\/p>\n<p>While it is a very practical conference in that regard, it is not going to be your typical \u201csit in your chair watching talking heads all day\u201d kind of event. It is being built as an experience not just a conference that connects enterprise leaders with leading edge innovators. \u00a0If any attendees are ever served baked chicken, I have failed.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Those wanting more information can contact Byron by <a href=\"mailto:byr&#111;n&#64;&#103;&#105;ga&#111;m&#46;&#99;o&#109;\">email<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Gigaom&#8217;s CEO Byron Reese is launching a new conference, Gigaom Change, which is &#8216;a hands-on summit designed to help those leading business&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2184122,"featured_media":950319,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[359256382,9204,359219992,359256381],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/949835"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2184122"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=949835"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/949835\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/950319"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=949835"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=949835"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=949835"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":949831,"date":"2016-03-23T04:10:54","date_gmt":"2016-03-23T11:10:54","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=949831"},"modified":"2016-03-23T04:10:54","modified_gmt":"2016-03-23T11:10:54","slug":"10-reasons-why-nobody-is-going-to-be-out-of-a-job-in-the-digital-world","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/03\/23\/10-reasons-why-nobody-is-going-to-be-out-of-a-job-in-the-digital-world\/","title":{"rendered":"10 reasons why nobody is going to be out of a job in the digital world"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>There\u2019s a lot of chat about the dangers to employment being driven by technology \u2014 with both blue and white collar work being threatened, according to a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk\/downloads\/academic\/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf\">report<\/a> from the University of Oxford.<\/p>\n<p>But how much of this is future hype, and how much short-term reality? Here\u2019s 10 reasons why nobody should worry about whether they will have something to do in the years to come:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Because decisions are more than insights.<\/strong> We may be able to get a great deal of information from analytics, but there will often be the extra level of judgement that only a human can bring. This is as true in healthcare and politics, as in customer service and situation response.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Because we have hair, nails and teeth.<\/strong> All of which require cutting, grooming and generally maintaining. The amount of time people spend having themselves looked after is as much in proportion to their wish to be looked after, as any hygiene factor.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Because we ascribe value to human interaction and care.<\/strong> In hospitals or day care centres, schools or gyms, or indeed, in taxis and public services, nobody, young or old, wants to be cared for by a robot. Nor will they ever.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Because we love craft.<\/strong> Robots have been part of assembly plants for many years now, and will continue to be. But we still love hand-crafted stuff. It may be possible to 3D-print a statue, but the merit of having something hand-made will sustain.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Because we value each other and the services we offer.<\/strong> Our capabilities are open to exploitation, it was ever thus. But the fundamental nature of a value exchange \u2014 \u201cI will do something for you, and you will recompense me\u201d \u2014 remains a constant.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Because we are smart enough to think of new things to do.<\/strong> Innovation, design, new thinking comes from people, not machines. And even if computers suggest new ways of doing things, it will be people that pick the ideas up and run with them.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong>Because complexity continues to beat computing.<\/strong> Even as we harvest ever larger quantities of data via sensors and cameras, through algorithms and actions, the ability of computers to make sense of it all remains behind the curve. To get ahead requires brains.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li><strong>Because experience and expertise counts.<\/strong> A plumber told me that when push-joints were invented, his father was concerned there would be no more need for plumbers \u2014 he needn\u2019t have worried. In this complex world, domain knowledge, earned over years, will retain its value.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li><strong>Because we see value in the value-add.<\/strong> If it is possible to produce a motorbike without manual intervention, it becomes a commodity \u2014 but then, the motorbike with customised artwork becomes the must-have item.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li><strong>Because the new\u00a0world needs new skills.<\/strong> A wealth of potential opportunity exists for future employment, if only we knew what it was \u2014 from drone pilots to 3D print shops, from data brokerage managers to IoT farm designers. And beyond.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The bottom line is that even as computer power increases, as we automate manual activities, we lose neither the desire, nor the propensity for work. We have evolved such that we see work as necessary: we derive satisfaction from doing it ourselves, and sharing the fruits of our labours.<\/p>\n<p>Production line jobs may come to be seen as a\u00a0historical aberration, the temporary consequence of industrialisation with primitive technology. And some people, who have spent their lives working in one area, may find themselves needing to work in others.<\/p>\n<p>But while jobs may change, we face neither a future life of leisure, nor a world of depression and worthlessness. The final sentence of the Oxford University report states, &#8220;For workers to win the race, however, they will have to acquire creative and social skills.\u201d Well, it just may be we already have such skills, and if only we weren\u2019t slaves to the machine we might be able to make better use of them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There\u2019s a lot of chat about the dangers to employment being driven by technology \u2014 with both blue and white collar work&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87746169,"featured_media":949655,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/949831"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87746169"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=949831"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/949831\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/949655"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=949831"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=949831"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=949831"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":949825,"date":"2016-03-22T10:01:02","date_gmt":"2016-03-22T17:01:02","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=949825"},"modified":"2016-03-22T11:24:10","modified_gmt":"2016-03-22T18:24:10","slug":"reverse-engineering-retail-for-the-post-channel-world","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/03\/22\/reverse-engineering-retail-for-the-post-channel-world\/","title":{"rendered":"Reverse engineering retail for the post-channel world"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>The Retail Business Technology Expo <a href=\"http:\/\/www.retailbusinesstechnologyexpo.com\">held<\/a> earlier this month at London\u2019s Olympia exhibition centre was as remarkable for what people didn\u2019t talk about, as what they did.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/zebra.com\">Zebra Technologies<\/a>\u2019 Mark Thomson hit the nail on the head. \u201cLook around, at the stands \u2014 nobody is talking about omnichannel anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cApart from a couple \u2014 and that\u2019s just because they haven\u2019t caught up yet.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Indeed. The \u2018omni&#8217; term did get a mention at the panel session on future-proofing the supply chain I hosted, but just the one. It\u2019s not that omnichannel is less relevant; more that the\u00a0discussion about channels is evolving, adapting to the perspective of an industry already re-orienting itself.<\/p>\n<p>Online and mobile are no longer new; they just \u2018are\u2019. And thinking about them as separate makes as much sense as making coleslaw without mayonnaise. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a shift towards customer centricity and a unified commerce approach, rather than a view that omnichannel is achieved,\u201d explains Mark.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s the principle: of course, the reality is a work in progress. It\u2019s still a major issue for a retailer to oversee the customer journey as an individual flits from online investigation, to in-store evaluation, then to mobile purchase (and potentially, physical return), which benefits neither retailer nor customer.<\/p>\n<p>Technologies are far from seamless;\u00a0it\u2019s challenging to get it all working together, with the result that customers can bear the brunt, for example being asked for the same information over and again.\u00a0 \u201cThe technology needs to get out of the way when the customer wants to buy,\u201d\u00a0says Ian Benn, Head of Northern Europe\u00a0at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ingenico.co.uk\/en\/\">Ingenico<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Part of the response could be tokenisation, originally conceived for customer privacy protection but with a spin-off benefit of acting like a non-intrusive customer \u2018cookie\u2019 within the sales process. \u201cTokenisation lets customers roam from point of sale to m-commerce to e-commerce and back again; often in the same purchase,\u201d Ian continues.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever the technological answer, according to my panellists, the trick is seeing what the whole of retail is about.\u00a0In this complex, digitally augmented world, retailers can lose touch with the fact they are ultimately curators, managing the relationship between customers and their suppliers, and getting the right products to the right people.<\/p>\n<p>This may sound obvious but it needs to remain front and centre of the retail and logistics strategy, whatever tools are available to achieve it and whatever their ramifications.<\/p>\n<p>The other two key parts of any strategy are to deliver on foundation standards for data format and exchange, and to get the different parts of the business engaged with what such capabilities enable. Essentially, these two pillars provide a technology-up and a business-down response to meet retail\u2019s fundamental goal.<\/p>\n<p>Consumers may have changed how they buy but the market remains wide open for those who can meet their needs, working across whatever \u2018channels\u2019 they choose to express them and along the entire route from supplier to warehouse, to home and beyond.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Retail Business Technology Expo held earlier this month at London\u2019s Olympia exhibition centre was as remarkable for what people didn\u2019t talk&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87746169,"featured_media":949827,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/949825"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87746169"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=949825"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/949825\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/949827"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=949825"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=949825"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=949825"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":949818,"date":"2016-03-16T05:16:00","date_gmt":"2016-03-16T12:16:00","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=949818"},"modified":"2016-04-11T03:51:12","modified_gmt":"2016-04-11T10:51:12","slug":"enterprise-security-in-a-mobile-first-world-does-not-stop-at-the-device","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/03\/16\/enterprise-security-in-a-mobile-first-world-does-not-stop-at-the-device\/","title":{"rendered":"Enterprise Security in a mobile-first world does not stop at the device"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Mobile technology has come incredibly far over the past few years, from smartphones and tablet computers being a luxury to becoming an essential tool for the enterprise, fundamentally changing how we do business.\u00a0This transformation provided the backdrop for Gigaom\u2019s recent Webinar\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LM8vPca1AZk\">Evolving Enterprise Security for the Mobile-First World<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As we discussed, mobile security has lagged behind the way <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/03\/04\/mobile-security-putting-the-consumerisation-genie-back-in-the-bottle\/\">we now use<\/a> such devices, which have moved significantly beyond email to offering a wide range of complex functions. At least until now, as considerable strides have been made to secure the data and services that can now be delivered.<\/p>\n<p>But security does not stop at the device. Speaking to Sam Phillips, Samsung USA&#8217;s Chief Information Security Officer and VP of Samsung Business Services for Enterprise Security, it became clear that while the features now available provide a robust foundation for mobile security, they should not be treated in isolation.<\/p>\n<p>We are working in a mobile-first world. Many organisations see mobile technologies as a source of innovation, of new business models and growth. Quite rightly so, as they hold a great deal of promise for both externally facing and operational tasks, for suppliers and customers, for support engineers and warehouse managers.<\/p>\n<p>The theme &#8216;security as a business enabler&#8217; has evolved from its past, internally-facing beginnings. Where good security once reduced risk, enabling better business by freeing sales representatives or supporting home workers, today security has become an essential part of the trust all stakeholders place in an organisation.<\/p>\n<p>In the platform economy, where a company is perceived through the services it offers online and via mobile, trust becomes a most important asset. \u00a0Lose this trust and you lose business, as many organisations have found out to their cost.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, we discussed, mobile security becomes both a strategic business imperative and tangible opportunity. This is recognised across the business, but adoption can sometimes happen without the basics being in place. \u201cBusiness adoption of Mobile has gotten ahead of CISOs and the CIOs they work with,\u201d says Sam.<\/p>\n<p>The mobile security mechanisms now <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2016\/02\/22\/how-the-latest-mobile-technology-will-give-your-business-the-edge\/\">available on devices<\/a>, coupled with the services available from a variety of partners, enable mobile services to be locked down or opened up, depending on data to be transferred and apps to be installed.<\/p>\n<p>While this gives organisations the flexibility to create secure mobile solutions to fit their own needs, it emphasises a key element of any mobile strategy.\u00a0\u201cBusinesses need to decide what they really want to do with mobile,\u201d explains Sam. With no one-size-fits-all, so organisations first need to understand what the data and apps are to achieve.<\/p>\n<p>This means more than aligning mobile strategy with business strategy. In reality, mobile becomes a fundamental element of the business models required in today\u2019s increasingly digital world, and therefore needs to be treated as such.<\/p>\n<p>Understanding this, and getting the basics right in terms of securing the mobile assets of the business, implementing a secure development life cycle for apps and so on, ensures mobile can become a powerful platform for business model innovation and enterprise transformation. The alternative means building a castle on sand.<\/p>\n<p>It remains to be seen how far mobile will go in the next five years, but it will only become a more embedded element of our business and personal lives. As it moves from an extension of the enterprise to an intrinsic part, getting the right pieces in place now will stand a firm in good stead for the future.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"680\" height=\"383\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/LM8vPca1AZk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mobile technology has come incredibly far over the past few years, from smartphones and tablet computers being a luxury to becoming an&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87746169,"featured_media":949721,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[359217384],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/949818"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87746169"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=949818"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/949818\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/949721"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=949818"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=949818"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=949818"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":949813,"date":"2016-03-15T03:03:08","date_gmt":"2016-03-15T10:03:08","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=949813"},"modified":"2016-04-11T03:52:41","modified_gmt":"2016-04-11T10:52:41","slug":"is-logistics-heading-towards-its-final-destination","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/03\/15\/is-logistics-heading-towards-its-final-destination\/","title":{"rendered":"Is logistics heading towards its final destination?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>In this digitally enabled world, it\u2019s easy to be distracted by the wealth of technology now available. Mobile apps and devices are <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2016\/02\/05\/mobile-devices-unleash-the-power-of-big-data-in-logistics\/\">transforming<\/a> the nature of logistics, for example, with devices now being used to track consignments, plan and monitor routes. Features from identifying gas station locations to directly updating customers are becoming part and parcel of the logistical journey.<\/p>\n<p>It would be trite to suggest that such capabilities are inadequate, as they quite clearly bring a great deal of value. For example, a local business with which I am familiar has improved visibility on its delivery team, to the extent that it can respond better to customer complaints. On one occasion, mobile technology proved that a driver was driving under the speed limit through a village, when a complainant said he was not.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time however, the features mobile apps currently provide are largely aimed at the logistical process itself \u2013 as if it existed in isolation from what was being delivered, and more importantly, why. The transportation of goods has traditionally been considered independently, largely because it is so manually intensive and, in itself, complicated.<\/p>\n<p>As technology advances however, this, more isolated nature of logistics is changing. A simple, yet profound example is the click-and-collect service, in which a retailer offers delivery of an online purchase to a location of choice \u2013 a shop or an affiliated delivery point. It\u2019s a great idea, making for a significantly improved customer experience \u2014 if it works. If it does not, the dream can quickly turn to nightmare.<\/p>\n<p>The key to success (or indeed, failure) is the ability to transmit clear information between the two most important components in the chain: the consignment, and its planned recipient \u2014 this could be a retail customer or, in the B2B case of spares management chain, a field engineer.<\/p>\n<p>Mobile devices remain a very important element, as they offer a window onto the logistical world. For this window to operate effectively however, back-end systems and tools (such as inventory systems, maintenance schedules and sales databases) need to exchange information in a fashion that appears seamless. No room exists for doubt, when it comes to whether a delivery has taken place.<\/p>\n<p>This may sound obvious, but it is not yet always the case. In one, anecdotal click-and-collect example, a customer went to a store to pick up a package, only to find it had already been returned due to a mismatch of delivery records. On another occasion, an order was cancelled as the product was no longer available, without updating the customer \u2013 who only found out when they arrived to collect it.<\/p>\n<p>Logistics simply cannot afford to make errors such as these, as they jeopardise its very rationale. On the upside, get things right and a number of new opportunities emerge \u2014 not least to differentiate the business in both B2C and B2B markets, but also to extend product ranges and squeeze that all-important operational efficiency.<\/p>\n<p>The threat is that incumbent logistics organisations\u00a0may not have forever to get things right. Consider Uber: while it, and its competitors, have significantly disrupted taxi and private hire services, the company\u2019s valuation\u00a0is based on its potential as a delivery mechanism for all forms of physical delivery.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Uber isn\u2019t valued at more than $50 billion because it&#8217;s a &#8216;taxi app&#8217;\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/fleetowner.com\/technology\/be-prepared-or-be-disrupted-supply-chain-expert-warns\">explains<\/a> Adrian Gonzalez, president of supply chain consulting firm Adelante SCM, but because, \u201cInvestors see Uber as a logistics company.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Despite such topics as\u00a03D printing, self-driving <a href=\"http:\/\/isearch.nhtsa.gov\/files\/Google%2520--%2520compiled%2520response%2520to%252012%2520Nov%2520%252015%2520interp%2520request%2520--%25204%2520Feb%252016%2520final.htm%0A\">vehicles<\/a> and flying drones threatening to impact the delivery and receipt of products, these remain early days for logistics \u2013 and furthermore,\u00a0the data integration points with other systems will remain the same, however a delivery takes place.<\/p>\n<p>So, this is certainly not the time to paint any disaster scenario. Rather, it is the right moment to get the basics of offering an integrated service right, in the knowledge that whatever comes in the future, it will only grow in importance.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In this digitally enabled world, it\u2019s easy to be distracted by the wealth of technology now available.

It is excerpted from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1119190754\/\">Not Everyone Gets a Trophy: How to Manage the Millennials<\/a><\/em> by <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/contributor\/bruce-tulgan\/\">Bruce Tulgan<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It seems that the vast majority of leaders and managers think Millennials have an attitude problem. But isn\u2019t this always the case when a new generation joins the workforce? Doesn\u2019t every new generation of young workers irritate the older, more experienced ones?<\/p>\n<p>At the early career stage of life, young people are just learning to break away from the care of others (parents, teachers, institutions) and taking steps toward self-sufficiency and responsibility. As they move into the adult world with the energy and enthusiasm\u2014and lack of experience\u2014that is natural at that stage, they are bound to clash with more mature generations.<\/p>\n<p>And yet as much as human experience\u2014such as the rite of passage into the workforce\u2014stays the same over time, the world doesn\u2019t. What makes each generation different are these accidents of history that shape the larger world in which human beings move through their developmental life stages. So while every generation rocks the boat when they join the adult world, they also bring with them defining characteristics that alter the rules of the game for everyone going forward.<\/p>\n<p>Millennials\u2019 \u201cattitude\u201d probably is not likely to go away as they mature; their high-maintenance reputation is all too real. Still, the whole picture is more complicated. Yes, Millennials will be more difficult to recruit, retain, motivate, and manage than any other new generation to enter the workforce. But this will also be the most high-performing workforce in history for those who know how to manage them properly.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Meet the Millennial Generation<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Although demographers often differ on the exact parameters of each generation, there is a general consensus that Generation X ends with the birth year 1977.  Most agree that those born between 1978 and 2000 belong in the Millennial Generation. But by our definition at RainmakerThinking, Inc., the Millennials come in two waves: Generation Y (those born between 1978 and 1989) and Generation Z (those born between 1990 and 2000). Gen Yers are today\u2019s thirty-somethings, no longer the youngest people in the workplace, while Gen Zers are the newest new young workforce, those who are filling up the rising global youth tide in today\u2019s workforce.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the short story with the Millennial Generation: If you liked Generation Y, you are going to love Generation Z. If Generation Y was like Generation X on-fast-forward-with-self-esteem-on-steroids, Generation Z is more like the children of the 1930s\u2026 That is, if the children of the 1930s were permanently attached to hand-held super-computers and reared on \u201chelicopter parenting\u201d on steroids. Overall, the Millennials embody a continuation of the larger historical forces driving the transformation in the workplace and the workforce in recent decades. <\/p>\n<p>Globalization and technology have been shaping change since the dawn of time. But during the life span of the Millennials, globalization and technology have undergone a qualitative change. After all, there is only one globe, and it is now totally interconnected. Millennials connect with their farthest-flung neighbors in real time regardless of geography through online communities of interest. But as our world shrinks (or flattens), events great and small taking place on the other side of the world (or right next door) can affect our material well-being almost overnight. Nothing remains cutting edge for very long. What we know today may be obsolete by tomorrow. In a world defined by constant change, instantaneous response is the only meaningful time frame.<\/p>\n<p>Why are Millennials so confident and self-possessed, even in the face of all this uncertainty? One reason is surely that they grew up in and after the Decade of the Child. Gen Xers were the great unsupervised generation (they made the latchkey into a metaphor). But Millennials are the great over-supervised generation. In the short time between the childhood of Generation X and that of Millennials (especially Generation Z), making children feel great about themselves and building up their self-esteem became the dominant theme in parenting, teaching, and counseling. Throughout their childhood, Millennials were told over and over, \u201cWhatever you think, say or do, that\u2019s okay. Your feelings are true. Don\u2019t worry about how the other kids play. That\u2019s their style. You have your style. Their style is valid and your style is valid.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For Millennials, difference is cool. Uniqueness is the centerpiece of identity. Customization of the self is sought after with great zest and originality, through constant experimentation. In the world of the Millennials, the menu of selfhood options is extraordinary and the range of possible combinations infinite. For the Millennials, customization is the Holy Grail, and it has always been right there within their grasp. From the first day they arrive in the workplace, they are scrambling to keep their options open, leverage their uniqueness for all its potential value, and wrap a customized career around the customized life they are trying to build.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3><strong>About the Author<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Bruce Tulgan is an adviser to business leaders all over the world and a sought-after keynote speaker and seminar leader.

The financial challenges are not only for the healthcare system, but also for families and caregivers who spend a significant amount of time and money caring for elderly. \u00a0Carers UK, a non-profit organization, has estimated that over 2 million people have given up jobs and over 3 million have cut back hours of work in order to care for sick or disabled elderly relatives. Gallup estimates that lost productivity due to caregiving amounts to over $25 billion annually in the US alone.<\/p>\n<p>These figures do not count the economic impact of chronic diseases and other issues that affect the elderly. Falls alone are estimated to cost nearly $15 billion\/year and are a major cause of death due to sequelae (additional complications) after the fall.<\/p>\n<p>While the headlines on wearables tend to focus on athletes and those who are already in good health, the business case for wearables for managing issues that afflict the elderly, coupled with the time and financial constraints on their caregivers, may be even more robust, if the right solutions could be made available.<\/p>\n<p>A brief look at the current market for wearables reveals that <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2016\/01\/12\/turning-smartphones-into-remote-monitoring-devices-for-older-adults\/\">solutions for the elderly<\/a> are beginning to enter the market. Personal emergency response systems (PERS), which can be worn by the elderly in the event of a fall, have been available for many years. These devices allow the user to summon emergency assistance by activating a button on the device that is worn on the wrist or around the neck. The next generation of PERS, such as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.artemisfashion.com\">Artemis<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amulyte.com\">Amulyte<\/a>, has broader applications for safety while also considering fashion and the use of smartphones.<\/p>\n<p>Even more importantly, we need to harness sensors to predict the onset of conditions that may lead to falls and other health issues before they happen.\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.agewellbiometrics.com\">AgeWell Biometrics<\/a> is a cloud-based platform that can connect to a broad range of wearable devices and enable healthcare professionals to evaluate stability of an individual and the risk of falls and other neurological issues.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the market for <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2016\/02\/05\/healthy-at-home-the-economic-benefits-of-remote-patient-monitoring\/\">remote monitoring<\/a> technologies that utilize sensors to measure cardiac function, track illness symptoms (e.g. <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2016\/02\/24\/do-patients-rely-on-mobile-healthcare-apps-more-than-their-doctors\/\">Samsung Gear Smartwatches<\/a>) or track location while safeguarding privacy (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.carepredict.com\">CarePredict<\/a>) looks set to grow. In the next several years we expect to see many of the expensive medical devices found in intensive care units become wearable sensors worn on the wrist or in clothing.<\/p>\n<p>This development will help health systems transition patients out of the hospitals (where they can be at risk of infection) and into the home sooner, hopefully for a speedier recovery. Other applications include focusing on conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s Disease and treating hand tremors, or applications for those suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.gpssmartsole.com\">Smart Sole<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>In order to realize the benefits of wearables for the elderly we will need to improve capturing and sharing this data with the right healthcare provider and\/or caregiver, at the right time. However, advances made in recent years are on the right track to deliver solutions which will make a real difference, in terms of both cost and quality of life.<\/p>\n<p>Photo credit: Neill Kumar<\/p>\n<p><!-- bitly link for promotions: http:\/\/bit.ly\/1RC8x3R --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Aging societies worldwide pose serious challenges to both healthcare delivery and how it is financed.

If we were going to really #ReinventTheOffice with HP\u2019s help, we needed to go full Thunder Dome on that machine. In the corporate world, that pretty much means we printed a lot of stuff on a tight deadline. The task at hand: financial reporting packets. That translates to 8 full color pages times eight packets plus spiral binding, stuffing, and labeling all before the UPS driver arrived at 3 p.m. We started at 2.<\/p>\n<p>HP states their <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/HPLaserJet123\">JetIntelligence<\/a> toner cartridge technology is \u201cengineered to make the printer print faster and enable higher page yields.\u201d This is highly important when two-day versus overnight shipping is on the line (see need for cost effectiveness in paragraph one). As previously stated, we were pushing the limit by starting at 2 p.m., but we like living on the edge. As it turned out, we had a bit of time to spare: it took just under four minutes to print 64 pages. Printing the mailing labels went even faster. The packets were done so far in advance we vowed to procrastinate even longer next month. You might be thinking the quality had to go down for the pages to come out that fast, but you\u2019d be wrong. The graphics looked great, even in full color, and the black and white was crisp. We were pretty pleased with round one.<\/p>\n<p>Over the next few weeks, it was business as usual at GigaOm, except it wasn\u2019t. It was better. The <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/HPLaserJet123\">MFP M477<\/a> kept right on printing at top speed, producing quality pages at an impressive clip. The first page out was particularly fast at under 10 seconds, under nine when printing black and white. Most jobs printed right around the top posted speed of 28ppm, which we loved. And changing the dreaded toner cartridge wasn\u2019t very dreadful at all, as it turned out. The built-in toner indicators were accurate and prevented premature replacement, and when it was truly time for a new cartridge, the auto seal remover feature made it easy and efficient. No more fighting, cramming, and messy hands.<\/p>\n<p>One feature we were particularly interested in is the anti-fraud technology touted in the product materials. Printers are part of our network, as they are in most businesses, and if not protected, they can provide unsecured access for hackers. This is not good. To prevent unauthorized access, HP employs three security tactics to protect our data: HP Sure Start, which validates the BIOS code; whitelisting, which authenticates the firmware; and runtime intrusion detection, which monitors and detects anomalies in firmware and memory operations. Those are abbreviated descriptions of some rather complex processes, but you get the idea.  <\/p>\n<p>Adding a faster printer to the fray might seem like an obvious way to improve productivity in business, but it\u2019s not that easy. Speed is great, but not when it means sacrificing graphic integrity, increasing cost, or complicating procedures. The MFP M477 goes beyond faster printing and really does simplify many aspects of office life. Removing the headaches of paper jams, toner explosions, frequent cartridge replacement, watching pages trickle out at a snail\u2019s pace, and fearing a security breech are all big steps forward. You might even say they\u2019re ways to #ReinventTheOffice. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last month we touched on the dual role of IT managers as both internal support and tech influencers at GigaOm.

I will synthesize his points down to these: work chat is good for quick-and-dirty, once-in-awhile discussions, and for team building, but the costs are considerable, since work chat is tiring, obsessive, interruptive, and leads to focusing people\u2019s attention on the near-term, while fracturing our concentration on what\u2019s really important.<\/p>\n<p id=\"9f58\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">Fried\u2019s mantra is \u2018real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time\u2019, which I completely buy.

Many of the problems that beset work chat in business contexts arise from <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">social crowding<\/strong>, when the dynamics of small groups are constrained or sidetracked because too many people move into groups to participate, when they aren\u2019t actually members of the set of people doing the work.<\/p>\n<p id=\"b3a2\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p graf--last\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Sets are characterized by small group social dynamics.<\/strong> There is frequent and reciprocal communication, so a member can post a request for help and get a response quickly, for example.

There is greater noise in the channel as the interlopers raise questions, throw their opinions around, and take sides in discussions. This crowding is worse that the noise, since the \u2018tourists\u2019 can lead to a decrease in the benefits of tight, in-group dynamics, and a hollowing out of purpose and shared goals.<\/p>\n<p id=\"14fd\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">So there are several threads that follow from social crowding:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"593f\" class=\"graf--li graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Social norms have to be expressly promoted to keep chat channel populations low, if they are going to be the site of effective team work<\/strong>. (Note: I mean the work done by teams, not the somewhat nebulous, rah-rah term on the posters in the lunchroom.)<\/li>\n<li id=\"300a\" class=\"graf--li graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Chat is not the only sort of social mechanism that we should apply to work communications<\/strong>, and specifically, <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">when we look at larger-then-set social groups there are better ways to communicate<\/strong>. We do much of our work as soloists and set members, but we are also members of larger <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">scenes<\/strong>\u200a\u2014\u200agroups of up to 150 more or less, made up of networks of sets. Effective communications at that level require more than\u200a\u2014\u200aor other than\u200a\u2014\u200achat. Consider Fried\u2019s suggestion toward a synchronous long-form \u2018writing it down\u2019 as just one example.<\/li>\n<li id=\"e1a6\" class=\"graf--li graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">This is a specific instance of the general issue of \u2018work as a commons\u2019.<\/strong> The folks that naturally most closely tied to some definable work activities\u200a\u2014\u200alike our marketing team, above\u200a\u2014\u200ashould have the largest say in how their work is performed, and the decision-making about their work practices.

It took me a while to realise that I didn&#8217;t actually have to watch them &#8211; some point after The Silence of the Lambs, I thought, nah. If I never see another horror film\u00a0again, I will not feel in the slightest bit bereft.<\/p>\n<p>But here&#8217;s the other thing. It took me even longer to work out that horror movies are deliberately looking to make people scared. I thought it was just how I reacted &#8211; badly &#8211; but no, that&#8217;s the whole point. If a horror film isn&#8217;t turning you into a blubbering wreck who checks the fridge when you get home, in case someone is hiding inside&#8230; then it isn&#8217;t doing its job.<\/p>\n<p>Which begs the question &#8211; what do stories become when we start to become participants in their creation? That&#8217;s exactly the question which the guys at the strangely named\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mashupmachine.io\">Mashup Machine<\/a>\u00a0have set out to answer. Their first story is Scary Cabin, yeah, you already get the plot. Or do you? What happens when you, or\u00a0anybody else, can change it?<\/p>\n<p>Clearly, Scary Cabin isn&#8217;t\u00a0really my kind of story.\u00a0I have a nasty feeling that my involvement would start with moving all sharp objects a good distance away, or simply getting the heck out of there (which is what the last person standing always seems to do &#8211; I want to be <em>that<\/em> person).<\/p>\n<p>But there is something in this. Stories evolve in their telling; they are embellished, refined. Teams can collaborate on plots, or simply nudge lead writers in a direction. Brainstorms can generate scenarios that have to be\u00a0integrated, sometimes with great effect. And we can now do all of these things with the power of a globally motivated crowd.<\/p>\n<p>Whether or not Mashup Machine is the answer, remains to be seen. This isn&#8217;t the first attempt at user-defined stories,\u00a0but it is coming at a time when a whole bunch of technologies are more readily accessible &#8211; the immersive nature of VR, for example, coupled with the\u00a0machine learning power of the cloud.<\/p>\n<p>Behind it all is storytelling itself, which is evolving in parallel with the digitally enabled society we are creating. Since ancient times we have told stories in order to learn, to cope and survive. For better or worse, the\u00a0stories we create digitally could\u00a0tell us more about ourselves, or the people we are becoming, than we could ever read in a book.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Here&#8217;s a confession: I hate horror movies.

That all-important chain of defense against security risks has been undermined by its weakest\u00a0link, people, in this case by using non-standard devices to conduct business and therefore making corporate data vulnerable to attack.<\/p>\n<p>The alternative, to roll out company-issued mobile devices, has not been an easy path to follow. When historical market leader Blackberry lost its leading position in the market to Apple and\u00a0Google\u2019s Android, companies also lost a significant part of the ability to control corporate messaging and applications from a central point.<\/p>\n<p>From the perspective of the IT shop, the consequence has been fragmentation, which has undermined the ability to deliver a coherent response in security terms. While solutions such as Mobile\u00a0Device Management have existed, they have been seen as onerous; also, some devices (in particular those based on <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2015\/07\/14\/mobile-security-drives-demand-for-android-in-the-enterprise\/\">Android<\/a>) have been seen as less secure.<\/p>\n<p>Looking more broadly, many organisations have ended up adopting an approach in which corporate devices are used alongside personal equipment for business use. The genie of consumerisation\u00a0is out of the bottle, say the pundits. But now devices exist that can deliver on an organisation\u2019s mobile security needs, the question is, can it be put back?<\/p>\n<p>The answer lies in addressing the source of the challenge, which is not the device but the person using it. Human beings assess risk all the time, and indeed, we are very good at it. In the case\u00a0of a mobile device for example, we are prepared to put up with a small amount of discomfort if it will get us the result we want: sending a message, say.<\/p>\n<p>If the discomfort is too great, we will assess other risks, such as, \u201cWhat happens if I get caught using my personal phone?\u201d If the answer is nothing, then the chances are that the behavior will\u00a0continue. With this in mind, anyone deploying a mobile solution needs to consider two variables: the discomfort it causes, and the cost of avoiding the discomfort.<\/p>\n<p>Considering the discomfort first, the point of any mobile solution is to enable productivity. Different security features \u2014 such as encrypted data storage, separation of apps and so on \u2014 may be\u00a0applicable to different business scenarios.<\/p>\n<p>Defining a solution appropriate for an organisation or group requires familiarity with the security features available on a device and the risks they mitigate. Better knowledge makes for more\u00a0flexibility, reduced operational overhead and therefore increased probability of a successful deployment.<\/p>\n<p>An equal partner to product knowledge should be an <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2015\/10\/07\/are-your-cios-rising-to-the-mobile-security-challenge\/\">understanding<\/a> of the organisation concerned, the data assets to be protected and what constitutes their acceptable use. If a policy is in place,\u00a0this may need to be reviewed: note that it needs to be signed off at the top of the organisation to be effective.<\/p>\n<p>Once a standard configuration has been defined, it will require testing. Too often, enterprise mobile security can fail \u201cfor want of a nail\u201d \u2014 insufficient licenses on the RADIUS server for example, or\u00a0lack of WiFi cover in areas where authentication takes place. Users need a solution that works from day one, or they will immediately lose confidence in it.<\/p>\n<p>Putting all these measures in place can help minimize discomfort, but the need to go hand in hand with measures to ensure that the capabilities cannot be circumvented. Note that we are talking\u00a0about the organisation\u2019s most important asset \u2014 it\u2019s people \u2014 who will respond far better to inclusionary tactics than draconian tactics.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time as understanding why secure mobile working technologies are being deployed however, employees need to know that they need to act as a strong link in the chain, not a weak\u00a0one. An Acceptable Use Policy should be enforceable, in that a staffer at any level\u2019s card will be marked if they attempt to circumvent it.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the genie should be given a clear timescale for getting back in the bottle. For example, in an \u2018anything goes\u2019 environment which mixes personal and corporate mobile equipment,\u00a0individuals should be given a cut-off date following which corporate data access will only be possible via a secure device.<\/p>\n<p>A final question is about sustainability, that is, how to keep it all going? Reporting is important, with deprovisioning perhaps the most critical \u2014 it is one thing to know that resources have been\u00a0allocated to the right people, but even more so is to know that any rights \u2014 and indeed devices \u2014 have been returned on change of role or exit from the company.<\/p>\n<p>The bottom line, and the most fundamental challenge, is that any shiny new corporate devices deliver on what they are supposed to do \u2014 in this case enabling mobile users to stay productive\u00a0without compromising on corporate risk.

This is the post-Baby Boomer shift that demographers and workforce planners have been anticipating for decades. It is not only a generational shift in the numbers in the workforce, but an epic turning point. This is the final stage of a historic period of profound change globally and a corresponding transformation in the very fundamentals of the employer-employee relationship.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Numbers Problem: Workforce 2020<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While there are always different people of different generations working side by side in the workplace, today there are as many as six different generations, depending on which demographic definitions one uses. The workforce is aging on one end of the spectrum and getting younger on the other. In the middle there is a gap, with the prime age workforce shrinking as an overall percentage of the workforce.<\/p>\n<p>Generations in the workplace in 2016. The oldest, most experienced people in the workplace, \u201cpre-Boomers,\u201d those born before the post-WWII \u201cBaby Boom\u201d began in 1946, are still greater than 1% of the workforce. The Baby Boomers (born 1946-64) are 30%, Generation Xers (born 1965-77) are 27%, and The Millennial Generation is 42%.<\/p>\n<p>Because both the Baby Boomers and the Millennials are such large generations with such long birth-year time spans by the broadest definitions, we have found it useful to split them each into first-wave and second-wave cohorts. Based on our model, here is a chart of the generations in the workplace today:<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/03\/Bruce-Tulgan-article-GENERATIONS-CHART-1.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-949710\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-949710\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/03\/Bruce-Tulgan-article-GENERATIONS-CHART-1.jpg\" alt=\"Bruce Tulgan article - GENERATIONS CHART 1\" width=\"709\" height=\"218\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/03\/Bruce-Tulgan-article-GENERATIONS-CHART-1.jpg 709w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/03\/Bruce-Tulgan-article-GENERATIONS-CHART-1-300x92.jpg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/03\/Bruce-Tulgan-article-GENERATIONS-CHART-1-680x209.jpg 680w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/03\/Bruce-Tulgan-article-GENERATIONS-CHART-1-210x65.jpg 210w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/03\/Bruce-Tulgan-article-GENERATIONS-CHART-1-81x25.jpg 81w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/03\/Bruce-Tulgan-article-GENERATIONS-CHART-1-320x98.jpg 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/03\/Bruce-Tulgan-article-GENERATIONS-CHART-1-640x197.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 709px) 100vw, 709px\" \/><\/a>\n<p><strong>The age bubble.<\/strong> On the older end of the generational spectrum, the workforce is aging, just as the overall population is aging. This is particularly notable in Japan, most of Europe, and North America. In North America alone, ten thousand Baby Boomers have been turning 65 every single day since 2011. The Boomers are filling up an \u201cage bubble\u201d in the workforce such that there are many more people at or near the ordinary age range for retirement. The exodus of the first-wave Boomers from the workplace \u2013 postponed for several years by the economic crisis that began in 2008 \u2013 is now swift and steady. By 2020 Boomers will be less than 20% of the Western workforce; older Boomers (born before 1955) will be less than 6%. What is more, Boomers who do remain in the workforce will continue trending heavily toward \u201creinventing\u201d retirement and late-career-pre-retirement: Working less than full-time, often partially telecommuting, and often working nonexclusively for more than one employer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The youth bubble.<\/strong> At the same time, the fastest growing segment of the workforce is made up of those born 1990 and later, so there is a growing youth bubble on the younger end of the spectrum. The youth bubble is growing even faster in \u201cyounger population\u201d regions of the world. But even in \u201colder\u201d North America, Europe, and Japan, the youth bubble in the workforce is rising much faster than in recent years because employers are once again hiring new young workers after several years of formal and informal hiring freezes resulting from the economic crisis. By 2020, second-wave Millennials (those born 1990-2000) will be greater than 20% of the Western workforce and another 4 \u2013 5% will be made up of post-Millennials born after the year 2000. And in most of the world, the youth bubble will be much, much larger. The rising global youth tide will bring to the workplace radically different norms, values, attitudes, expectations, and behavior.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Workforce 2020 \u2013 Remember \u201c2020, 20, 20.\u201d<\/strong> By the year 2020, the Western workforce will be made up of less than 20% Baby Boomers and more than 20% second-wave Millennials, (plus another 4 \u2013 5% of post-Millennials).<\/p>\n<p><strong>The rising global youth tide.<\/strong> The youth bubble is much, much larger in Africa, Latin America, and much of Asia. Second-wave Millennials are already, in 2016, greater than 45% in India, Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, and Vietnam; in Nigeria greater than 60%. By 2020, in these younger parts of the world, those born 1990 and later will be more than 60% of the workforce. Considering the increasing globalization of the workforce, one important feature of the growing youth bubble is that it will be increasingly global, with a much greater percentage of the new young global workforce coming from outside of North America, Europe, and Japan.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Excerpted from RainmakerThinking, Inc.\u2019s white paper, The Great Generational Shift What is the Great Generational Shift?

Siftery helps companies discover enterprise software they should be using. Disclosure: I am an investor and board chairman at Siftery).<\/p>\n<p>The high-level macro is that the world of software is getting way more crowded and way more complex.<\/p>\n<p>Buying software is daunting &#8230; but it is also REALLY impactful. The right software gives you a competitive edge. Software isn\u2019t just <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460\">eating the world<\/a> &#8230; it can help you eat your competitors for brunch. Choosing the right vendors is really important for businesses to succeed &#8230; so we would expect companies to be spending much more time selecting vendors &#8230; and they have.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Four Numbers: 20, 10, 12, and 4<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In the last dozen years, we have seen a software explosion. This is mainly due to software being easier to buy, integrate, deploy, and use because it no longer needs to be hosted on premises. This software is usually lumped together as SaaS (or DaaS or even some other name) &#8230; but the main take-away is that one does not need a really expensive on-premises integration and therefore it can be tried and used quickly and with less risk.  <\/p>\n<p>When we talk about \u201csoftware\u201d, we\u2019re not just talking about code you run inside your corporate firewall. And we\u2019re not just talking about traditional SaaS products (like Salesforce, Workday, etc.) either. We\u2019re also talking about data services your company consumes (like Bloomberg and Acxiom). And services that help market your business (like ad networks and Google search spend). And subscriptions you use to help your business (like LinkedIn and Glassdoor).  <\/p>\n<p><strong>20: The number of software vendors has increased 20x in just ten years<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s right. There are twenty times the number of software vendors that there were just ten years ago. There are a lot of causes of this rapid increase:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> As stated earlier, it is much easier to buy software, so there is more software to buy.<\/li>\n<li> The really large software companies have embarked on a strategy of growing their product and feature set by acquiring companies (or sometimes partnering) rather than developing these features and products in-house.<\/li>\n<li> Seeing this opportunity, venture capital firms have poured tens of billions of dollars funding software companies.  <\/li>\n<li> It is now much cheaper to start a software company because of things like distributed computing and the rise of software companies that help other software companies.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>10: The number of software products (unique vendors) a company buys has increased 10x in the last ten years<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is an even crazier statistic than the first macro trend. Take the average large retailer &#8212; ten years ago they had maybe 40 software vendors across their organization &#8230; and today they will have 400. One large retailer polled by Siftery has over 2,000 software vendors!<\/p>\n<p>The right software stack gives your company a competitive advantage. And because it is so much easier to buy today (and there are more people making buying decisions), companies are becoming increasingly open to buying from a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.growthverse.com\/static\/view\">large number of vendors<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The major beneficiary of this trend has been start-ups &#8230; they can get a beachhead in large companies much faster than they could in the past.  <\/p>\n<p>Of course, this trend is happening in some industries faster than others. Retailers are super fast adopters &#8212; probably because their business is so competitive and the market leaders there (Amazon, Walmart, etc.) are filled with incredibly smart technologists.  <\/p>\n<p>Companies that have many regulatory requirements to keep their data on premises (like financial institutions and healthcare) have fewer software vendors &#8230; but even there we have seen a massive increase in the diversity of vendors.<\/p>\n<p><strong>12: The number of internal buyers has increased 12x in the last ten years<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The number of people buying software (or influencing the buying) of software in a company has grown dramatically. Almost every professional in a company is now a buyer. Software engineer? Buyer. Salesperson? Buyer. HR Manager? Buyer. Finance person? Buyer. Lawyer? Buyer. Marketing? Definitely a buyer. In 2012, <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2012\/07\/the-end-of-solution-sales\">CEB did a study<\/a> that found buyers did \u201c60% of a typical purchasing decision\u2014researching solutions, ranking options, setting requirements, benchmarking pricing, and so on\u2014before even having a conversation with a supplier.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>In fact, only 12% of the users of Siftery are in traditional IT. The other 88% care just as deeply about the software for their organization.<\/p>\n<p>And it is easier than ever to buy. Companies like New Relic and Sendbloom have built their company selling one seat at a time to an organization and then using their internal advocates to get larger deals. Freemium software like Slack, Glassdoor, and Cloudflare make it easy to try. Freemium or low cost products mean less red tape and less need for budget approvals in the initial stages of adoption. <\/p>\n<p>Engineers, lawyers, salespeople, finance, HR, marketers, etc. that can pick and implement software are the ones rewarded with promotions and bonuses. Professionals that do not develop the core skill of picking the right software vendors will find much more limited career paths.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4: The spend on software has increased 4x in ten years<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A 4x spend is an astonishingly large increase &#8212; and it is because software is easier to buy and it is becoming more and more powerful. Of course, since the number of vendors a company has increased 10x, the dollars per vendor has decreased dramatically in the last ten years. This trend might be worrisome for the giant enterprise software companies but it is really good news for software companies that are innovating and are on offense.  <\/p>\n<p>One thing to note is that during the last ten years, these same companies that are spending so much more on software have not significantly increased the number of people they employ. In fact, many companies have FEWER employers today than they did ten years ago (even though revenue has increased). The take-away is that companies are choosing to spend on software INSTEAD of people. This may or may not be a good thing for the world &#8230; but it is happening and will likely continue to happen.  <\/p>\n<p><strong>The fragmented world of software will continue<br \/>\n<\/strong><br \/>\nMost every macro data point on Siftery shows the trend of the last ten years will continue in the next ten. It\u2019s easy to dismiss that this abundance and fragmentation is just part of a cycle that\u2019ll eventually move towards consolidation. But if one digs a level deeper to look at the forces that created such a vast, fragmented and active product ecosystem, it becomes apparent that this isn\u2019t a trend but a transformation. More business processes are automated now than ever before \u2013 run by software or reliant on it. In many cases, we see software talking to software, APIs talking to other APIs. As long as this data can be integrated well, there will be more software.  <\/p>\n<p>This means there will be even more software companies in the future than there are today. And buyers will be even more overwhelmed and will need help deciding what to buy, how to buy, how to integrate, and how to best use the software.<\/p>\n<p>I invested in Siftery (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.siftery.com\/\">www.Siftery.com<\/a>) because I love their unique way to help discover software.

While we spend most of our time in a few neighborhoods, it doesn\u2019t really come as a surprise to encounter an old friend or colleague that you haven\u2019t talked to in years, hanging out in your corner caf\u00e9. So I was not surprised to hear that my old friend Antony Brydon had started a new company with a compelling value proposition, called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.directly.com\">Directly<\/a>, and that he and his head of marketing, Lynda Radosevich, thought I\u2019d like to learn about it.\n<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/41.media.tumblr.com\/819fff0ffd81ea897ee51ca89174162f\/tumblr_inline_o30feyJx7h1qc7p1s_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\"\/><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;\">Antony Brydon<\/p>\n<p>I met Antony when he was CEO of Visible Path, an innovative social startup, one that was working to build the work graph &#8212; through email analysis &#8212; in the \u201800s. Visible Path was acquired by Hoovers in 2008. Perhaps they were a bit ahead of the market, but that\u2019s a sign that Brydon &amp; Co are generally ahead of the power curve.<\/p>\n<p>I was also not surprised that Directly\u2019s value proposition is very, very smart: helping other companies scale their customer support capabilities by breaking out of what I think of as the skills versus wages snare (see figure 1).<\/p>\n<p>The snare is this: as the necessary skill level for customer support increases, the wages that must be paid increase. This is a fundamental aspect of supply and demand.<\/p>\n<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/56.media.tumblr.com\/5b55d6ac04d33db06f22e7cee294c278\/tumblr_inline_o30fidwsCK1qc7p1s_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\"\/><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;\">figure 1 &#8212; The Skills v Wages Snare<\/p>\n<p>But Antony and his partners have come up with a way to break the snare, and Directly is the platform on which that magic happens.<\/p>\n<p>I recently interviewed Antony about Directly, and why the company is growing so quickly.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2>The Interview<\/h2>\n<p><b>Stowe Boyd<\/b>: One thing I&#8217;d like you to do is tell the origin story. In every superhero comic strip, there&#8217;s the story that they tell about how Peter Parker got bitten by a radioactive spider, or Steve Jobs visiting PARC. So, what led to the founding of Directly?<\/p>\n<p><b>Antony Brydon<\/b>: It was not as dramatic as Peter Parker and the radioactive spider, but it was interesting. And it was interesting because the company founding \u00a0and the initial \u00a0inspiration were probably 15 years apart. Back before Visible Path, I worked in a call center for a few years: back in &#8217;98. I worked for a venture firm which invested in Genesis, Aspect, and Aurum: a lot of the early call center players.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>Call centers was an interesting beat, but it was a little depressing because the customers were very rarely happy with the service they were receiving. &#8211; Antony Brydon<\/h3>\n<hr \/>\n<p>For the better part of three years, that was my beat. And I was looking at a lot of Fortune 100 call center buyers to figure out what products they needed. Call centers was an interesting beat, but it was a little depressing because the customers were very rarely happy with the service they were receiving.<\/p>\n<p>The agents in the call center were a downtrodden labor force: modern-day galley ships. The call center managers were doing the best they could, but often saw themselves as sort going to war with the tools they had. Under equipped and underserved. Very tactical.<\/p>\n<p>Genesis had some incredible skill-based routing that I used in a project. It could actually connect a customer to an absolute perfect agent. But that capability wasn&#8217;t being used very broadly. There were a lot of reasons it wasn&#8217;t. Some of the call centers didn&#8217;t want to hire the truly skilled agents because it could cost more money.<\/p>\n<p><b>SB<\/b>: Right, and I bet they didn&#8217;t want to test people to gather all that data, either. That was expensive, too.<\/p>\n<p><b>AB<\/b>: Yes. They didn&#8217;t want to break their agents down into different pools based on skills levels because utilization would drop. If you had one homogeneous pool, you could give a call to anybody. If you had 10 skills-based pools, utilization fell through the floor, so the economics fell down. A great example of really great technology that didn&#8217;t get applied anywhere near the degree that it should because of the constraints in the business model. And that, entrepreneurially, was pretty depressing to watch.<\/p>\n<p>My diagnosis was that the problem wasn&#8217;t the technology. The problem was the talent side of the equation, and how that talent was being managed. There was no amount of technology to fix it. When you&#8217;ve had very low skill folks being hired at very low wages, who are being pushed to handle 60, 80, 100 customers a day and sort of being churned out 12, 13 months later once they met the learning curve, well that invariably put a low ceiling on customer experience. A depressing trend, and that was the reason I made a conscientious move to stop working on it<\/p>\n<p>That wasn&#8217;t the inspiration for Directly, per se, but that was my diagnosis at the time. That was the real problem. It made me very unexcited.<\/p>\n<p>For the last kind of 15 years, whenever Jeff [Paterson, the co-founder and head of product at Directly] and I sold a company, we would come back to this problem that had bothered me a long time ago and just started hacking to see if we had any new approach or insight that we had that we could bring to bear on it.<\/p>\n<p><b>SB<\/b>: You&#8217;re saying the obvious thing was being blocked by the business model, which led low-skilled people to become more skilled, and then their higher wages would become unaffordable.<\/p>\n<p><b>AB<\/b>: Yes, absolutely. Skilled workers could have been created very quickly. So, if you had a Samsung Galaxy question that was routed to a Samsung Galaxy expert, and that person was doing a normal number of inquiries for the day and wouldn\u2019t have the boot on the back of their neck to get off the phone in 6 minutes. But that was blocked by the economics of the business model, and that blocked the talent model.<\/p>\n<p>We looked at this in 2001 after eMusic had just got acquired. We looked at it in 2008 after we sold Visible Path. When we came back to it in 2011, we had the benefit of seeing a lot of these on-demand companies coming up. We saw Lyft coming up. And Uber coming up. And Airbnb. And all of these companies taking advantage of a kind of fractional availability.<\/p>\n<p>When we applied that to the old problem, we saw for the first time we saw the potential of pulling together people with much higher skill sets than would ever sit in a call center. And then making them available for small fractions of time. When their skill set really matched a customer&#8217;s problem, and at levels where they could really opt in and delight a customer. With that combination of the ability to get more talent than had existed before, and then also to render that talent. Making the business model, the economics of it, work.<\/p>\n<p>So that was the initial insight. That&#8217;s what started down that pathway quickly, building some quick primitive apps and starting testing that idea. It bore out very quickly.<\/p>\n<p>We did some initial tests in kind of 6, 12 weeks of initial building. We got some very good signals back that we could attract very skilled folks and pair them with customers very efficiently and very quickly. It took a lot of work to actually develop the engines and all of the enterprise innovations. But those are the book ends. There was that insight in &#8217;98 that no amount technology could fix broken talent model and a broken business model. Then there was that &#8216;aha&#8217; in 2011 and 2012 that the on-demand piece would be a very elegant solution to this problem.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>At that point in the interview, I started to sketch a 3D model in my journal, based on Antony\u2019s use of the term \u2018Fractional Availability\u2019. In figure 1, the 2D model above, we saw the snare, the dead-end that Antony has described as an economic problem that technology couldn\u2019t fix in 1998. But with the surge of interest in on demand platforms &#8212; like Uber, Lyft, and Airbnb &#8212; a new alternative appears.<\/p>\n<p>An additional dimension appears, so that people with high skills can still be affordable, because they don\u2019t have to be hired as full-time workers sitting in a call center. They can be paid only for the time that they are handling customer support requests, and they have gained their expertise at no expense to the company using their services on a part-time, on-demand basis. They\u2019ve gained that skill as a power user, on their own time, for their own reasons.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/40.media.tumblr.com\/01d20179790801184fff9c45e84cd062\/tumblr_o30gwgayNd1qjn6dko1_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\"\/><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;\">Figure 2 &#8212; Fractional Availability<\/p>\n<p>Here we see the 3D reality: it is possible to pay low \u2018wages\u2019 (perhaps \u2018costs\u2019 would be better) for highly-skilled customer support because of the wormhole that is fractional availability. (I think of it as something like the Guild Navigators in the Dune series, who can \u2018fold space\u2019 and travel \u2018without moving\u2019 from one star system to another light years away.)<\/p>\n<p>So, if you take the 3D chart above and look at it end on &#8212; concealing the dimension of fractional availability, it would look like figure 3, below. Directly allows companies to shift the needle from high costs for high skills, by tapping into the game-changing economics of fractional availability.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/41.media.tumblr.com\/19f7c384df071ef60dce7213e8f8f275\/tumblr_o30gwgayNd1qjn6dko2_400.jpg\" alt=\"image\"\/><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;\">Figure 3 &#8212; Back in Two Dimensions<\/p>\n<h2>Theories into Practice<\/h2>\n<p>In the next post in this series, I will dig into the specifics of how Directly has moved the needle at a specific customer\u2019s call center operations, a case study based on the adoption of Directly at MobileIron. But behind that practical and tactical step-by-step adoption is the origin story of Antony\u2019s frustration with call center economics in 1998, and the role that fractional availability is having on the world. Directly\u2019s success has come from harnessing that theory, and making it do the heavy lifting.<\/p>\n<p>Also, you might like to hear Antony and Jonathan Keane,<br \/>\nDirector of Customer Service at Republic Wireless <a href=\"http:\/\/go.directly.com\/republic-wireless\">in a livecast<\/a> on the topic: How To Deliver 2.9 Minute Response Times During A New Product Launch, Thursday, February 25 @ 11:00am PST\/ 2:00pm EST.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The tech world is in many ways like a large city.

Right now, for example, Virtual Reality is rocking my boat \u2014 but why? I can\u2019t help asking the so-what questions: what does it do for us, where does it go that we can\u2019t otherwise, and so on. Frequently the answer lies not in any one technology, but in the way they inter-operate: the Internet of Things is in reality a vast, distributed data generator, very little of the latter we have yet learned to exploit.<\/p>\n<p>All of which means that, while the various cool (a.k.a. hyped) things going on in technology are interesting, my own view is that they will have more of an impact as they start converging. We could be&#8230; no, let me rephrase, we are just scratching the surface of what technology enables us to do. In the book I am drafting, to be called Smart Shift, I call this the Law of Diminishing Thresholds \u2014 as costs fall, so the solution space expands. Exponentially.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that the last few years, as interesting as they have been, will be seen as a pause in the overall cycle of innovation, as the tide withdraws only to come crashing back upon the shore. Even the current darlings of the industry are reaping what has already been sown; but new seeds are already growing, and it is on the basis of these that the next wave of corporate and societal change will be felt.<\/p>\n<p>In the knowledge that we are on the brink of a breakthrough, I present a technological map of the future. I drew this largely to get this off my chest (and boy, is that a relief) but also to set the scene. Anybody focusing on one area or another is missing the emerging bigger picture, and as the future will be build upon this foundation, so it is important to see as much of it as possible.<\/p>\n<p>At the moment I have more questions than answers \u2014 another confession. I wish it were different because, if I knew what the future held, I could start placing a few bets. Sure, robots; sure, semantics; sure, self-programming and orchestration, all of which will have a profound impact. I&#8217;ll be expanding on these topics here at GigaOm.<\/p>\n<p>As things stand however, I will make only one hard prediction: hold on to your hats, it\u2019s going to be quite a ride.<\/p>\n<p>P.S.

Of all the things kids hope to be when they grow up, \u201cIT Guy\u201d almost never tops the list. Yet here we are, many of us parlaying a love for computer games or coding into a 40-hour\/week job where our passion for all things digital takes a sharp turn for the mundane. It\u2019s a simple fact: there\u2019s just too much minutiae to really enjoy being an IT professional most days. Our natural born problem-solving skills \u2013 talents, really \u2013 go underutilized thanks to clunky, antiquated laptops, copiers, and printers that demand way more time than they\u2019re worth. Where\u2019s the fun in that?<\/p>\n<p>The common thread among IT professionals is that we love technology. It\u2019s in our titles, after all. Let\u2019s pause for just a moment for full disclosure: HP sponsored this post, challenging us to #ReinventTheOffice here at Gigaom. And oh, do we love a challenge. But aside from a deep-seated appreciation for shiny new tech toys, how can office machines really improve corporate life? It\u2019s in the details. Give your employees free coffee, welcome to the status quo. Give your employees a free-roaming barista with coffee, lattes, and macchiatos\u2026welcome to utopia! Everyone appreciates better, especially when it makes life easier. It\u2019s what sets a good printer apart from a great one, and HP is positive they\u2019ve got the <a href=\"http:\/\/hp.com\/go\/newlaserjets\">special sauce<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-949652\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/02\/L1120861-294x300.jpg\" alt=\"L1120861\" width=\"294\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/02\/L1120861.jpg 294w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/02\/L1120861-50x50.jpg 50w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/02\/L1120861-137x140.jpg 137w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/02\/L1120861-48x48.jpg 48w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/02\/L1120861-25x25.jpg 25w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px\" \/> Until A.I. officially takes over, business machines have one critical thing going for them: they\u2019re free from the emotions, physical limitations, and time constraints the rest of us humans have to contend with every day. They can work harder, faster, longer, and better than us mere mortals at many tasks, upping the ante on productivity and efficiency and making us look really good at our jobs. Investing in industry-leading technology, therefore, makes perfect sense. We get away from the basic, day-to-day management of a multitude of office machines and instead focus on development that really moves the needle for business. We feel valued, accomplished, and part of the team. Finally, our futuristic thinking comes into play! Problems are solved! World peace is restored!<\/p>\n<p>Well.<\/p>\n<p>To put it simply, increasing a company\u2019s efficiency and the quality of work makes everyone happy. When we\u2019re allowed to work smarter, not harder, we thrive. And if you\u2019re the IT Guy, the addition of innovative technology is just icing on the cake. It\u2019s not a new concept, but trusting office machines to tackle multiple tasks, and do them exceptionally well, is no easy feat. There\u2019s not an IT manager in the world who isn\u2019t on the hunt for the most streamlined, high-performing devices on the market that meet these requirements and then some. We want it all: speed, high output, low cost, low maintenance. And, to be honest, gadgets are cool. It\u2019s even cooler when the latest, greatest devices really do improve our business. If wanting the biggest, baddest, and best for our team is wrong, we don\u2019t want to be right.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s get back to that coffee idea. If we\u2019re truly going to #ReinventTheOffice, we have to combine the finer details that set a business apart \u2013 expert barista! \u2013 with the technologic innovations that drive it forward \u2013 streamlined machines! The result is kind of a big deal. HP promises to take the workhorses of the office, the printers we use every day, and make them faster, leaner, and smarter so we can focus on doing business and not on managing our equipment. Add the industry\u2019s most advanced security and you\u2019re practically in unicorn territory. It\u2019s an aggressive agenda, but in the interest of future-thinking and world peace, we\u2019re willing to try it out.<\/p>\n<p>IT professionals serve double duty as both internal support and tech influencers at Gigaom. As a company, we bring the highest caliber news, editorial, and product information to our audience, and we implement our own best advice to keep our office running at its best. We\u2019re taking a hard look at HP\u2019s #ReinventTheOffice challenge, which aligns perfectly with our goal to stay on the leading edge of business technology. As usual, our readers will directly benefit from these efforts, but our IT managers will undoubtedly enjoy testing out that new, shiny toy. Stay tuned.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Doctor. Lawyer. Architect. Professional baseball player. Dragon slayer!

According to a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.pagefair.com\/2015\/ad-blocking-report\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">PageFair and Adobe report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, U.S. ad blocking grew 48% in the twelve months leading up to June 2015. That\u2019s 45 million users\u201416% of the population\u2014who just said no to digital and, in particular, mobile web advertising by downloading ad blocking applications. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With eyeballs and revenue on the line, thought leaders debated whether the ad blocking trend would destroy or save advertising. The Association of National Advertisers (ANA) <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/ana-blames-unwieldy-digital-ecosystem-for-ad-blocking-crisis-1444925373\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">blamed<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> the digital ecosystem. The Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB) <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/adage.com\/article\/digital\/iab-advertisers-content-providers-messed\/300919\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">blamed<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> themselves for having \u201clost track of the user experience.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(They also notably took <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/iab-ceo-continues-to-hammer-ad-blockers-1453849338\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">ad blockers to task<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> for disingenuous practices, most specifically paid \u201cwhitelists\u201d for publishers.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The cost of ad blocking is significant, with an <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.adweek.com\/news\/advertising-branding\/how-online-industry-losing-8-billion-every-year-168389\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">estimated<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> $781 million dollar loss for the industry. But another resonating impact of the Great Ad Rebellion of 2015 will be found in its influence on marketing investments. What will marketers do differently to navigate the digital\/mobile landscape in 2016? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Revisiting advertising<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lest there is\u00a0any question, ad blocking will not <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">prompt an all-out surrender by the ad ecosystem. Some publishers, like GQ, Forbes and more recently <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.adweek.com\/news\/press\/want-block-ads-wired-will-start-charging-you-it-169528\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Wired<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, are fighting fire with fire, by blocking users with ad blockers. But the longer term strategy is to address the issues with ad experience. Some<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> of this responsibility falls on publishers, who determine the degree of disruption that must be tolerated to access content, as well as the ad tech landscape, where fierce competition can inspire\u00a0extreme approaches\u00a0to ad engagement. (To steer\u00a0publishers and platforms to a more user-friendly approach, and as part of its mea culpa, the IAB introduced <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.iab.com\/news\/lean\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">new guidelines<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> that emphasize \u2018light, encrypted, ad choice supported, non-invasive ads\u2019.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But no change can succeed unless marketers direct ad dollars to those that are innovating in favor of an improved experience. This isn\u2019t a simple task, given that site-by-site scrutiny can work against the efficiency gains of programmatic buying, a practice that has itself been <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mediapost.com\/publications\/article\/258660\/agencies-point-finger-at-programmatic-say-it-cont.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">blamed for the surge in ad blocking<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. As such, there will also be other moves to optimize ad impact, including increased investment in emotionally-aware ads, where data is used to extrapolate insights about a user\u2019s psychological state in a given moment. Incorporating a measure of receptivity into ad delivery could prove to be the much-needed difference between engaging a consumer and ticking them off. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Thinking beyond advertising<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ongoing concerns about ad ROI will prompt more marketers to deepen investments in\u00a0other approaches. Native advertising, the modern day equivalent of the advertorial, offers a worthy complement to traditional ads. Content marketing and branded content will help brands meet the need to feed social channels. Influencer marketing will gain practitioners as marketers struggle to connect with elusive millennial audiences. We\u2019ll also see more brands practicing corporate social responsibility and, of course, promoting those good deeds via social channels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Each of these tactics offer a subtler alternative to the traditional advertising message. And while this can be a strength in an oversaturated landscape, there is a fine line between subtle marketing and the calculated manipulation of audiences. The FTC tuned into this, releasing <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/tips-advice\/business-center\/guidance\/native-advertising-guide-businesses\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">guidelines<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to ensure consumers can distinguish\u00a0native advertising from content. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But marketing&#8217;s\u00a0most powerful critics are the consumers themselves, which leads to the next point&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Embracing feedback\u2014in all forms<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In a world of 24\/7 marketing, brands\u00a0are constantly challenged to creatively and authentically\u00a0engage consumers in \u201cconversation\u201d. \u00a0The always-on dialogue represents\u00a0tremendous opportunity, but it doesn\u2019t come without risk. Today consumers are quick to call brands out when they\u2019ve missed the mark, even when it\u2019s as seemingly innocuous as Red Lobster\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/digiday.com\/brands\/beyonce-new-song-formation-red-lobster-response\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">slow response<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to a shout out from Beyonc\u00e9. Success doesn&#8217;t grant immunity\u00a0either, as is evidenced by the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/11\/13\/business\/expecting-warm-embrace-rei-chief-is-harangued-in-reddit-forum.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">less than warm welcome<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> REI received on Reddit\u00a0following its widely-celebrated <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/adage.com\/article\/digitalnext\/rei-s-optoutside-a-model-future-marketing\/301177\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">#optoutside<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> campaign.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This vulnerability could make one want to crawl back into the safe confines of traditional marketing, but of course that\u2019s not an option. In 2016, more marketers will have strategies in place that allow them to creatively participate in the two-way dialogue while also managing the inherent risk. This means more than having an ear to the ground; brands need a plan that allows them to\u00a0quickly gauge when and how\u2014or <em>if<\/em>\u2014it makes sense to engage or respond.\u00a0(Arby\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3987302\/arbys-jon-stewart-the-daily-show\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">farewell<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to their consistent critic Jon Stewart is a stellar example of a brand creatively and effectively steering into negative feedback.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It may be that consumer ad blocking is really only part of this feedback cycle\u2014 less a mass exodus from advertising than it is an aggressive critique of its current form. Either way, it is a milestone in the ongoing transition from one-way marketing, perhaps one of the last nails in the coffin. Today, consumers have more than just a voice\u2014they control the levers on which messages they receive and when.

And to get there, the company will have to retrain\u200a\u2014\u200aor replace\u200a\u2014\u200amany of its 280,000 workers.<\/p>\n<p>But today\u2019s businesses are not going to take on the burdens of such a massive training effort: they will instead expect workers to <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2013\/10\/03\/deep-culture-series-dig-your-own-hole-sharpen-your-own-shovel\/\">dig their own hole and sharpen their own shovel<\/a>, as I put it. Before anyone can get reengaged with their job, they have to get reengaged with their work, on a personal level. As I wrote,<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>This is where a truce has to be called and each individual commits to personal program of engagement in what they consider their calling, which may only obliquely line up with the job that the company has that person doing. This involves reading, reflection, discussions with other like-minded people, and sharing and growing those thoughts in groups, offline and online. My expression for this investment, where the individual reengages with their own work, in a sense independently of the company (or companies) they may be working for, is this: Dig your own hole, sharpen your own shovel.<\/p>\n<p>And this will involve time. Each person will have to carve out time for this engagement: it won\u2019t just happen.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>AT&amp;T seems to be making this corporate policy.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<p>Quentin Hardy, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/02\/14\/technology\/gearing-up-for-the-cloud-att-tells-its-workers-adapt-or-else.html?ref=todayspaper\">Gearing Up for the Cloud, AT&amp;T Tells Its Workers: Adapt, or Else<\/a><\/p>\n<p>In an ambitious corporate education program that started about two years ago, he is offering to pay for classes (at least some of them) to help employees modernize their skills. But there\u2019s a catch: They have to take these classes on their own time and sometimes pay for them with their own money.<\/p>\n<p>To Mr. Stephenson, it should be an easy choice for most workers: Learn new skills or find your career choices are very limited.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere is a need to retool yourself, and you should not expect to stop,\u201d he said in a recent interview at AT&amp;T\u2019s Dallas headquarters. People who do not spend five to 10 hours a week in online learning, he added, \u201cwill obsolete themselves with the technology.\u201d<\/p>\n[\u2026]\n<p>Companies\u2019 reinventing themselves to compete with more nimble competitors is hardly a new story. Many have tried, and a handful have even succeeded. Mr. Stephenson wants AT&amp;T to be among those few.<\/p>\n<p>In the last three years, he has spent more than $20 billion annually, primarily on building the digital business. DirecTV was acquired in a $63 billion deal last year, and several billion more was spent to buy wireless businesses <a title=\"DealBook article.\" href=\"http:\/\/dealbook.nytimes.com\/2015\/01\/26\/att-to-buy-nextel-mexico-for-1-9-billion\/\">in Mexico<\/a> and the United States. Even for a company with $147 billion in 2015 revenue and over $400 billion in assets built up over more than a century, it\u2019s a lot.<\/p>\n<p>That can\u2019t happen unless at least some of his work force is retrained to deal with the technology. It\u2019s not a young group: The average tenure at AT&amp;T is 12 years, or 22 years if you don\u2019t count the people working in call centers. And many employees don\u2019t have experience writing open-source software or casually analyzing terabytes of customer data.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t develop the new skills, you won\u2019t be fired\u200a\u2014\u200aat least AT&amp;T won\u2019t say as much\u200a\u2014\u200abut you won\u2019t have much of a future. The company isn\u2019t too worried about people leaving, since executives estimate that eventually AT&amp;T could get by with one-third fewer workers.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Stephenson declined to project how many workers he might have by 2020, when the cloud-based system is supposed to be fully in place. One thing about cutting people in an aging work force, he noted, is that \u201cdemography is on our side.\u201d Other senior executives say shrinking the work force by 30 percent is not out of the question.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>AT&amp;T\u2019s Vision2020 program for employee education is based on workers giving up time on nights and weekends\u200a\u2014\u200auncompensated\u200a\u2014\u200abut with the company reimbursing the cost of courses up to $8000\/year.<\/p>\n<p>My bet is that this is the new basis for strategic commitment to an educated workforce: the company will pay the out-of-pocket costs, but the worker still has to hold down a full-time (or more than full-time) job, and to dedicate serious amounts of \u2018leisure\u2019 time to coursework, time that normally would be spent on outside interests, family, or moonlighting. Depending on your perspective, this looks like a fair deal, an additional encroachment of work into the personal time of workers, or just the way things are, now.<\/p>\n<p>And this might be the best deal workers can get, in an economic climate of endemic recessionary philosophy mixed with the threat of becoming obsolete in a marketplace driven by high technology, and being hollowed out by automation, AI and algorithms, and free-trade outsourcing of work abroad.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Originally published on <a href=\"https:\/\/workfutures.io\/as-good-as-it-gets-3d6e54132950#.ljkkif572\">medium<\/a> on 13 February 2016.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Putting the burden of retraining in a digital world on the backs of the workers may be as \u2018enlightened\u2019 a policy as&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2184122,"featured_media":830217,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[359228424,359223345,943],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/949633"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2184122"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=949633"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/949633\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/830217"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=949633"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=949633"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=949633"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":949605,"date":"2016-02-10T07:02:52","date_gmt":"2016-02-10T15:02:52","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=949605"},"modified":"2016-02-11T22:56:28","modified_gmt":"2016-02-12T06:56:28","slug":"corporations-can-be-people-and-now-cars-can-be-their-own-drivers","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/02\/10\/corporations-can-be-people-and-now-cars-can-be-their-own-drivers\/","title":{"rendered":"Corporations can be people, and now, cars can be their own drivers"},"content":{"rendered":"<h3>The US National Highway Traffic Safety Agency may have adroitly resolved the notion of driver accountability for the coming smart car future.<\/h3>\n<hr \/>\n<p id=\"bd9f\" class=\"graf--p graf--first\">It may sound like a \u2018through the looking glass\u2019 paradox, but the US National Highway Traffic Safety Agency (NHTSA) has decided\u200a\u2014\u200ain the face of relentless innovation in driverless vehicles\u200a\u2014\u200athat cars can be their own drivers.

The idea of a \u2018successful social enterprise\u2019 is simple if you approach it superficially. In that case you simply define \u2018success\u2019 as some degree of adoption of social tools, and the harvesting of their purported benefits based on the network effects of social integration. A richer, and more nuanced definition requires a deep dive into significant changes in people\u2019s aspirations, corporate values, and dispersal of tech platforms that underwrite new ways of work, not just new ways to communicate. (But this is not the place for that book to be written.)<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<section class=\" section--body\">\n<div class=\"section-divider layoutSingleColumn\">\n<hr class=\"section-divider\" \/>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner layoutSingleColumn\">\n<blockquote id=\"8339\" class=\"graf--pullquote pullquote graf--first graf--last\"><p><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pullquote-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pullquote-em\">A sense that the promise of social collaboration has failed is the backdrop for many companies and teams moving to try work chat-based solutions, and the resurgence in the use of email.\u200a\u2014\u200aStowe Boyd<\/em><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<section class=\" section--body\">\n<div class=\"section-divider layoutSingleColumn\">\n<hr class=\"section-divider\" \/>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner layoutSingleColumn\">\n<p id=\"3b02\" class=\"graf--p graf--first\">Q2: Why do companies consider forming an enterprise-wide social network and what are the biggest benefits?<\/p>\n<p id=\"73c3\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">A2. There is actually a large-scale migration away from the now-mainstream model of \u2018social business = a company using enterprise social network as platform for communication, collaboration, and coordination\u2019. A sense that the promise of social collaboration has failed is the backdrop for many companies and teams moving to try work chat-based solutions, and the resurgence in the use of email, now somewhat socialized (like IBM Verse and Microsoft Office 365).<\/p>\n<p id=\"34d8\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">Q3: How are enterprise social networks used to share knowledge and increase innovation?<\/p>\n<p id=\"4d77\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p graf--last\">A3. Information sharing (mistakenly called \u2018knowledge sharing\u2019) is one of the most direct benefits of social platforms, of whatever kind. They decrease the costs involved, and the social motifs\u200a\u2014\u200alike following, @mentions, and topical activity streams\u200a\u2014\u200ahave revolutionized how we think about working together. I think increasing innovation is a separate, but immensely important issue. Tools need to stand out of the way, drop into the near background, so that innovation can happen: they don\u2019t engender creativity, per se.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<section class=\" section--body\">\n<div class=\"section-divider layoutSingleColumn\">\n<hr class=\"section-divider\" \/>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner layoutSingleColumn\">\n<blockquote id=\"58de\" class=\"graf--pullquote pullquote graf--first graf--last\"><p><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pullquote-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pullquote-em\">In a few years the inroads made by touch, voice, gesture, and surreality will have profound impacts on how people at work choose to communicate.\u200a\u2014\u200aStowe Boyd<\/em><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<section class=\" section--body\">\n<div class=\"section-divider layoutSingleColumn\">\n<hr class=\"section-divider\" \/>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner layoutSingleColumn\">\n<p id=\"8fe6\" class=\"graf--p graf--first\">Q4: What hurdles do organizations face when implementing an enterprise social network? How can you overcome these hurdles?<\/p>\n<p id=\"bfab\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">A4. The hurdles of adopting any innovation\u200a\u2014\u200alike a new communications or information platform for business\u200a\u2014\u200aare consistently the same. First, people differ to the degree they are psychologically disposed toward adoption of new technologies and techniques (and the values that come along with them). So-called <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">innovators<\/em><\/strong>\u200a\u2014\u200aEd Rogers\u2019 term\u200a\u2014\u200aare quick to adopt, and the\u00a0<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">laggards<\/em><\/strong> are most averse, and the rest of us are distributed in between in other groups: <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">early adopters<\/em><\/strong>, <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">early majority<\/em><\/strong>, and <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">late majority<\/em><\/strong>. That\u2019s the nature of people. Each group has its own set of concerns and considerations that slow adoption to a greater or lesser extent. This is independent of the specifics of any technology or the dynamics of any company, and dominates\u00a0<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">The Diffusion of Innovations<\/em><\/strong>, which is why Everett Rogers named his magisterial book that.<\/p>\n<p id=\"9c42\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">In the case of ESNs, adoption has been problematic because the benefits are difficult to quantify, are slow to be realized (if at all), and the established alternatives (like email) are deeply embedded in business practices and processes. This has been so slow a process that innovators and early adopters are jumping the curve and moving onto new approaches before the majority has adopted the old ones. So ESNs are already a lap behind in the communications platform foot race.<\/p>\n<p id=\"96b2\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">Q5. How do you see enterprise social networks evolving over the next 5 years?<\/p>\n<p id=\"c046\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p graf--last\">A5. The continued acceleration toward mobile, wearables, and augmented and virtual reality (or <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">surreality<\/em><\/strong>, as I call it) will mean even more of a migration away from desktop\/laptop use and the decline of \u2018desktop\u2019 motifs. In a few years the inroads made by touch, voice, gesture, and surreality will have profound impacts on how people at work choose to communicate. Added to the rapid rise of AI assistants (or assistance, depending on your view), the premises of \u2018working together\u2019 will change as much as the Web has done, already. So, while we will still be working in social networks in five years\u200a\u2014\u200awe are human beings after all\u200a\u2014\u200awe will be unlikely to be using platforms based on the design and organizing principles of what we call ESNs, today.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<section class=\" section--body section--last\">\n<div class=\"section-divider layoutSingleColumn\">\n<hr class=\"section-divider\" \/>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"section-content\">\u00a0<em>Cross-posted from <a href=\"https:\/\/socialogy.io\/q-a-about-enterprise-social-networks-with-ibm-8f32e3a6a69e#.rib1j3uip\">medium<\/a> and<\/em><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">\u00a0<\/em><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http:\/\/stoweboyd.com\/post\/138931973382\/qa-about-enterprise-social-networks-with-ibm\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http:\/\/stoweboyd.com\/post\/138931973382\/qa-about-enterprise-social-networks-with-ibm\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">stoweboyd.com<\/em><\/a><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\"> on 8 February 2016.<\/em><\/p>\n<footer class=\"postArticle-footer\">\n<div class=\"postActionsFooter container u-size740\"><\/div>\n<\/footer>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>IBM sent some questions following the recent IBM Connect conference.

I read a great analysis by Jessica Lessin at The Information, suggesting that there may be. In <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/the-end-of-tech-startups?unlock=677a9e&amp;token=eed2b15628f0d9fe619eaff16ce07ea767a27559\">The End of Tech Startups<\/a><\/em> she writes,<\/p>\n<blockquote>[&#8230;] the period where tech startups can readily disrupt larger tech companies is ending for a simple reason: Today\u2019s tech behemoths aren\u2019t the lumbering giants of yesteryear. They are leaner and meaner and more competitive precisely because they have co-opted the same technologies startups used to attack them.<\/p>\n<p>Take cloud computing. Sure, AWS makes it dead simple for two developers in a garage to spin up a company. But Microsoft, Facebook and Google have massive cloud infrastructure advantages of their own. In fact, they\u2019re the ones powering some of these startups. Anything startups have access to, big tech companies have access to in a much deeper way. So they can operate faster\u2014and test faster. And because they can test faster, they can build faster.<\/p>\n<p>Then consider internal communications. One of the biggest advantages any startup has is the ability to make decisions and communicate quickly without layers of bureaucracy. Often they do so by adopting the latest sort of collaboration method quickly.<\/p>\n[&#8230;]\n<p>To all you aspiring tech entrepreneurs out there, it\u2019s time to get creative if you want to take on a tech company. And if you don\u2019t, there\u2019s still plenty of opportunity going after non-tech incumbents in everything from media to education and health, which is probably why we\u2019re seeing so many startups turn their attention outside of tech these days.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Lessin suggests we&#8217;re moving to an era where the Internet giants simply will have too much juice for startups to prevail against them.

The LinkedIns and Tableaus will lose much more than the giants, and the giants will continue to turn the screws, leveraging their positional, financial, and operational advantages. They will continue to win even as investors lose.<\/p>\n<p>And startups will face the worst conditions: less capital, worse valuations, very strong entrenched Internet giants dominating in all important markets.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On Thursday, LinkedIn posted some very disappointing numbers, and the result was a massive bailout on the stock.

For me, it was the curved screen that earned my instant skepticism. Cool? Sure. But I didn\u2019t see the urgency; the flat screen still felt modern, delivered a wonderful picture and the joy of extra space gained from tossing the old box was still reasonably fresh in my mind. The curved screen struck me more as innovation for innovation\u2019s sake, an upgrade designed for the upgrade-obsessed, and left me pondering if it was possible to run out of great ideas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Then, when I realized the natural moment for my next phone upgrade was approaching, I found myself face-to-face with the Samsung Galaxy Edge. Lo, the curved screen was calling! But, before I could answer, I had to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. (And, yes, drop a few puns.) <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This modern innovation\u2014gimmick? innovation?\u2014went beyond mobile phones, so I decided to start with large screens. When it came to curved televisions, it was easy to see that I wasn\u2019t alone in my skepticism. Numerous reviews panned the \u201cimmersive\u201d curved television display as a gimmick, while others pointed out that the curve could compromise viewing from certain angles. It\u2019s not hard to imagine that if your reclining chair is over in that far corner, to the side of the TV, that curve is going to get in the way, but <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/arstechnica.com\/gadgets\/2014\/01\/whats-the-deal-with-curved-tvs\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Casey Johnston of Ars Technica<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> offered a rather detailed analysis of the field of view. It seemed that the curve most benefited from theater-style seating and, according to fellow skeptic <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/scottkramer\/2015\/06\/25\/curve-appeal-why-curved-screen-monitors-make-more-sense-than-curved-tvs\/#3c2be9b8332d\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Scott Kramer of Forbes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, \u201cYou\u2019d need a very large model \u2014 at least 70 inches \u2014 to really make the concept even work. Anything smaller and the vibrancy and immersion just aren\u2019t compelling factors.\u201d Cue Roy Schieder: <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWe\u2019re going to need a bigger apartment.\u201d<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So my initial doubts about the curve seemed validated where TVs were concerned. Monitors, however, were a different story. The \u201cimmersive\u201d benefits of curved screens fared better in the one-person-per-screen scenario, where you were less likely to be sitting off to the side while playing games and streaming. \u00a0As noted in this <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/smbz.us\/1VvXyMp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">article<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the natural presentation and field of view supplied by these devices reduce neck and eye strain\u201d, so there would be productivity benefits for the business environment as well. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(Though both points make sense to me, as someone who is attached to the web for the better part of her waking hours, the thought of the telltale screen curving in closer and closer struck me as horror movie material.) But general receptivity to curved monitors aside, the fact that <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.idc.com\/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS25636815\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">monitor sales, in general, are dipping along with PC sales<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> means that they won\u2019t likely be the driving force behind the curved revolution. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That led me back to mobile devices. Despite the buzz, curved mobile phones aren\u2019t actually that common. Samsung was (ahem) ahead of the curve, with LG not far behind. And sure, it was a clear differentiator in a sea of iPhones, but could the curve <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">do<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> anything? Early curvers, Samsung Galaxy Round and LG Flex, opted for opposite approaches (side to side and head to toe body curves, respectively) and promised &#8211; yes &#8211; an <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">immersive<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> experience. The curved body also performed better in pocket, because it aligned better with the curve of the human form. The Edge had a different approach, with the display wrapping around the sides of the device. My first (skeptical) take was that the Edge chose style over function, but then I discovered that the extra real estate served a few functions beyond aesthetics, including a colored light indicator that could tell you who is calling when the phone is face down. Meanwhile, Cool? Sure. Urgent? Well&#8230;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At this point, I had reached the limits of online product research. The claim of the curve clearly went beyond specs, so I brought my skepticism to in-store, imagining the satisfaction of telling the Best Buy clerk that I was only doing research\u2014I wasn\u2019t someone who was taken in by innovation for innovation\u2019s sake. Except that, when I reached the curved screen TVs and stood in front of their promotional solar system graphics, I couldn\u2019t help myself: I nodded my head and my lips formed the word: \u201cImmersive.\u201d I was getting sucked in. By the time I reached the mobile section and plucked the Samsung Edge from its display podium, it struck me as mobile\u2019s equivalent of an infinity pool. Cool. Serene. Desirable. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And this is where the aforementioned snap judgements come in handy. There is, simply, an incredible range of products to pine over today but, if you decide out of the gate that a particular innovation is a gimmick, it\u2019s a lot easier to avoid that whispering want. As of the writing of this article, I have not (yet) upgraded my phone, and my television is still flat. But, I confess, I do<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">see the appeal for the curved screen. Features and functions aside, its real strength is that it is a delight to view. And while \u201cdelight\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to urgency, that ever-important factor needed to drive up sales right this minute, isn\u2019t that exactly what you want from something that\u2019s designed to be viewed?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><!-- bitly link for social promotion: http:\/\/bit.ly\/1o2BX3N --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sometimes it can be helpful to make a snap judgement on a particular innovation, just to keep from getting overwhelmed in today\u2019s&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87833663,"featured_media":949595,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[9424052,198757106,359241493,359241494,71599,359216191,32630,359217384,244439,77155],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/949582"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87833663"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=949582"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/949582\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/949595"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=949582"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=949582"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=949582"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":949585,"date":"2016-02-02T06:57:00","date_gmt":"2016-02-02T14:57:00","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=949585"},"modified":"2016-02-11T23:01:03","modified_gmt":"2016-02-12T07:01:03","slug":"cut-into-the-present","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/02\/02\/cut-into-the-present\/","title":{"rendered":"Cut into the present"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019m attending IBM Connect 2016 in Orlando as an IBM-selected Futurist, which is a first of a sort.

But, I haven\u2019t heard nearly as much about the future of work and #newwaytowork as I had hoped.<\/p>\n<p id=\"c1ac\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">The opening sessions were strongly oriented toward IBM Verse, and its instrumentation of a mocked-up company. While I appreciated the illustration of Verse\u2019s many well-considered affordances, I came away with the strong impression of a fictionalized but very conventional organization behind the play acting. However, this is mostly reading between the lines of the script, because the company wasn\u2019t really described, aside from being a maker and marketer of sporting goods.<\/p>\n<p id=\"c8a2\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">What would have been much better\u200a\u2014\u200aat least for me\u200a\u2014\u200awould have been to take some of the trends that are inarguably transforming businesses today, and to surface them explicitly as part of the story. What about the rise of freelancers, and the uberization of work, or the pressure to adapt to a new digital markets and economics? Or consider any of a dozen other themes that impact us all, as individuals, companies, and as a society. If things aren\u2019t changing, why are companies adopting new tools?<\/p>\n<p id=\"c8e0\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">Or even better, how about if IBM had presented a (slightly rosy) projection of a hypothetical near-term future, and lent some guidance to its customers about how to thrive there, how to transition to better adapt to that just-over-the-horizon world, and (yes) how IBM can help in the colonization of that new day.<\/p>\n<p id=\"5e9a\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">Without that vision, I think any vendors\u2019 demonstrations of tools fall a bit flat, because we are left only to imagine how we might use them today. Or more pragmatically, how we would use them in the company of last week or last month or last year. Your company today has already changed in ways that its management and employees have not realized.<\/p>\n<p id=\"bd8d\" class=\"graf--p graf-after--p\">McLuhan said,<\/p>\n<blockquote id=\"665b\" class=\"graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><p>We look at the present through a rear-view mirror.

Within the past decade, <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2015\/12\/30\/assessing-the-top-mobile-security-trends-of-2015\/\">mobile devices<\/a> have gone from being exceptional to the norm. And millions of potentially insecure devices are now being connected, in the <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2016\/01\/15\/staying-on-task-with-wearables-in-the-workplace-infographic\/\">guise<\/a> of the Internet of Things.<\/p>\n<p>So, is all lost? Not necessarily. There is still a place for a robust security architecture, built on the principle of the \u2019separation of concerns\u2019 \u2014 that is, limiting risk by considering how and where business data needs to flow, and putting appropriate safeguards in place. Indeed, I wrote a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1780172206\/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1780172206&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=separatedoutp-20&amp;linkId=YUEA4K26NEZK2IDC\">book<\/a>\u00a0about it.<\/p>\n<p>We can talk about technical features and governance mechanisms to be built into such an architecture, as is good and proper.\u00a0But data security is never, ever going to work without taking on board the most important, yet least predictable variable in the triumvirate of people, process and technology \u2014 the people.<\/p>\n<p>In technology industry parlance, the term \u2018consumerisation\u2019 has been used to describe our increasing propensity to use our own tech in the workplace. But the principle goes much deeper. Consider, for example, how people expect to take their phone number with them when they move companies.<\/p>\n<p>In general, employees will follow the rules, particularly if their contract says they have to. Acceptable Use Policies are a useful tool against direct abuses of computer systems, software and services. But you don\u2019t need to be a behavioural psychologist to know that people hate to be told what to do if it appears pointless or indeed, counterproductive.<\/p>\n<p>This goes right to the top. Gone are the days when senior executives expected their emails to be printed out for them, so they could dictate a response. Today, they are as tech-enabled as the rest of us, and expect to make full use of what is available \u2014 even if it means using their own devices, due to perceived inadequacies of corporate IT.<\/p>\n<p>Is there an answer? Well, yes there is, but it requires looking way beyond current environments and towards the workplaces, and work forces, of the future. Not only are people becoming more tech-savvy, they are also more transient. Companies hire less and subcontract more. Where once they built, today they partner. And offices are replacing cubes with collaborative spaces.<\/p>\n<p>This brave new world of work is built upon a spirit of trust and collaboration, with smarter organisations drawing on the broadest pool of stakeholders \u2014 co-creating with customers, suppliers and even competitors. While this approach puts people first, it nonetheless requires boundaries to be set and enforced \u2014 but without getting in the way.<\/p>\n<p>Agility is key to the future, in data security as in business.\u00a0For security to succeed in such a flexible environment, it needs to consider the role of data as an enabler to collaboration, as well as offering service provisioning mechanisms that are considerably more straightforward than today.<\/p>\n<p>If you create an environment which hinders, rather than help people to deliver on the needs of the business, you will increase, not decrease strategic business risk. While this creates a dilemma for any security professional, that does not make it wrong. As organisations evolve over the next decade, we shall see this point proven again and again.<\/p>\n<p><em>For more content like this, follow Samsung Business on\u00a0<\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/smbz.us\/Insights\"><em>Insights<\/em><\/a><em>,\u00a0<\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/smbz.us\/Twitter\"><em>Twitter<\/em><\/a><em>,\u00a0<\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/smbz.us\/LinkedIn\"><em>LinkedIn<\/em><\/a><em>\u00a0,\u00a0<\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/smbz.us\/YouTube\"><em>YouTube<\/em><\/a><em>\u00a0and\u00a0<\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/smbz.us\/SlideShare\"><em>SlideShare<\/em><\/a><em>.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><!-- Bitly link here --><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This post is\u00a0sponsored\u00a0by\u00a0Samsung.

Sony has set the new company up with a US headquarters &#8212; San Mateo, CA &#8212; with a single CEO, Andrew House. Notably, console sales are way down in Japan, <a href=\"http:\/\/arstechnica.com\/gaming\/2016\/01\/sony-moves-playstation-to-the-us-with-new-company-sony-interactive-entertainment\/\">to the lowest level in 24 years<\/a>, and the future looks to be mobile and handheld gaming there.

But, while every company has some variation of a cloud strategy on their roadmap, the move to the cloud is a journey that doesn\u2019t happen overnight. Most often, it\u2019s a gradual implementation because some processes must still run on-premises or in a private cloud, while others can more easily and compliantly be supported in the public cloud. <\/p>\n<p>Organizations are becoming more and more comfortable with a hybrid model because it makes good business sense\u2014combining the flexibility and cost savings of the cloud with the option to keep more complex applications on-premises. There are many reasons why businesses may want to combine on-premises and cloud instances, from specific policies relating to where data can be stored, to having previously purchased on-premises solutions, to a future-focused strategy that integrates more and more cloud opportunities. In fact, a 2014 report by Infonetics Research confirms that hybrid cloud is becoming the \u201cnew normal\u201d as adoption among enterprises was expected to more than double by 2015. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Hybrid Is the New Normal<\/strong><br \/>\nThis new normal is your new challenge: managing a hybrid environment that consists of private and public clouds and on-premises IT infrastructures. No longer are you responsible for just managing on-premises solutions within your own borders. Now you have to manage applications across the cloud as well. To effectively meet this challenge, you\u2019ll need visibility into all of the pieces of this increasingly diverse environment.  <\/p>\n<p><strong>Visibility Into the Hybrid Environment<\/strong><br \/>\nVisibility across on-premises and cloud deployments is the key to navigating the shifting tide of IT management in the hybrid world because you cannot manage what you cannot see. You\u2019ll need visibility across the environment to gain an understanding of cloud workloads and to ensure service levels, security and compliance. <\/p>\n<p>In addition, you\u2019ll need this visibility into what\u2019s happening and why so that you can determine whether your hybrid environment is functioning as you had intended. If any of the applications that have moved to cloud aren\u2019t performing as expected, you need to know so that you can modify your strategy. When you have refined your strategy and the workloads you\u2019re running in the cloud are as reliable and secure as they were on-premises, you\u2019ll want visibility into that as well, so you\u2019ll feel ready to begin transitioning more and more workloads to the cloud.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hybrid In the Real World: Gatwick Airport <\/strong><br \/>\nOne organization that maintains visibility and compliance through a hybrid model is <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.splunk.com\/2015\/11\/13\/gatwick-at-conf2015\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gatwick Airport<\/a>. Among its other cloud solutions, Gatwick integrated Splunk Cloud into its operations to supplement its existing on-premises solution. In doing so, the team realized that combining ops data in this cloud solution gave them the agility and scalability they needed, while providing insight into airport performance.
