He is responsible for driving the company&#8217;s global AI strategy and infrastructure. He leads Baidu Research in Beijing and Silicon Valley as well as technical teams in the areas of speech, big data and image search. In addition to his role at Baidu, Dr. Ng is an adjunct professor in the computer science department at Stanford University. In 2011 he led the development of Stanford&#8217;s Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) platform and taught an online machine learning class that was offered to over 100,000 students. This led to the co-founding of Coursera, where he continues to serve as chairman. Previously, Dr. Ng was the founding lead of the Google Brain deep learning project. Dr. Ng has authored or co-authored over 100 research papers in machine learning, robotics and related fields. In 2013 he was named to the Time 100 list of the most influential persons in the world. He holds degrees from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT and the University of California, Berkeley.<\/p>\n<p>Andrew will be speaking at the <a href=\"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/ai\/\">Gigaom AI<\/a> in San Francisco, February 15-16th. In anticipation of that, I caught up with him to ask a few questions.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>Tell us about your daily work at Baidu. What does your AI team do?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re involved in developing basic AI technology. Everything ranging from speech recognition to computer vision, to NLP, to data warehousing, to user understanding; and using this technology to support a lot of Baidu internal businesses, as well as incubate new directions. So for example, within Baidu, all of our major lines of business have already been transformed using AI. Everything from web search to advertising, to machine translation, to the way that we recommend restaurants to users. So, AI is already pervasive throughout Baidu. In addition to that, we see a lot of new opportunities that are created by AI, such as better conversation-based, this is chat box-based, medical assistant, or using face recognition to build turnstiles that open up automatically when an authorized person approaches it. So all of our teams are pursuing those new vertical opportunities, as well.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Would any of what you do fall under the category of basic research? Do you ever do things because, say, this might be useful, but we don\u2019t exactly know how?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We do a lot of work in basic research, and you know, it&#8217;s interesting how successful basic research starts out as basic research, but after some period of time becomes less basic, once you see the application value. So, we&#8217;ve had a lot of that. I would say that within Baidu, our early face recognition work had started out as what felt like basic research, but now this service is in production, and really serving hundreds of millions of users. Our early work in neural machine translation, had started out as basic research. In fact one aspect of this story that&#8217;s not widely known: Neural machine translation was a technology first pioneered and developed and shipped in China. The U.S. companies developed and shipped it well after Baidu, and so I think this is one example of a place where our China teams definitely led the way. I feel that our basic research computer vision, in, for example, face rec, has also been pioneering. Today, we&#8217;re doing basic research on learning robots and machine learning broadly. I think that our research covers the whole spectrum, from very basic to very applied.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What would a team look like at Baidu? Do you generally have small teams? Are they developer-heavy? What have you found to be a successful way to allocate limited resources?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a complicated question. I will say a lot of our projects start small. For example, a year ago, our autonomous driving team was 22 people. But after the team developed some traction, and showed initial promise, and developed a well thought-through business plan, that allowed us to justify pouring tremendously larger amounts of resources, now maybe hundreds of people, into a team to build, what started as a basic research project into a brand new business direction. So we&#8217;ve had a lot of projects start from relatively small teams, but after they&#8217;ve shown traction and the value was clear, we wound up building it into teams of many dozens, or even a few hundred people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think is a hard problem in artificial intelligence today, that we&#8217;ll solve in five years? What&#8217;s something that would be very difficult today to do, but in five years&#8217; time, it&#8217;ll be commonly done?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>From a research perspective, I think that transfer learning and multi-task learning is one of the areas that I would love to figure out. Most of the economic value of machine learning, today, is applied learning, learning from a lot of labeled data that was labeled for the specific task you&#8217;re trying to solve, such as trying to learn to recognize faces from a huge database of faces that are labelled. For a lot of tasks, we just don&#8217;t have enough data in the specific vertical that we want to build our system for. So one of the up and coming areas is transfer learning, where you have a machine learn a different task. For example, learn to recognize objects in general. And having learned to recognize objects in general, how much of that knowledge becomes useful for the specific purpose of recognizing faces.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m seeing very, very promising traction from the research perspective, and there are techniques that are now widely used for this type of transfer learning, but it feels that the theory and best practices of how to do this, is still in its incredibly early stages. The reason we are excited by transfer learning is because the modern deep learning has proved incredibly valuable for problems where we do have a lot of data. This has been a huge driver of value across many, many applications. But there are also a lot of problems where we just don&#8217;t have that much data. Take speech recognition. There are some languages, envision Mandarin Chinese, for which we have a ton of data. But there are also some languages, you know, spoken by small populations, and we&#8217;ll never get a huge dataset of those languages. So is it possible to take what we learn from, say Mandarin, and transfer that knowledge, in order to do speech recognition for a Chinese dialect that is spoken for a much smaller population, and for which we therefore have a much smaller amount of data? We do have techniques to do this, and we are doing it today, but I think that advances in this research area will allow AI to tackle a much broader range of problems.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Does artificial intelligence tell us anything useful about human intelligence? Or, conversely, do we use cues from human intelligence to make AI work better, or is it the case that they both share the word intelligence, but they&#8217;re nothing alike at all?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The knowledge from neural science has been only a little bit useful for the recent developments of artificial intelligence. Realistically, despite all the centuries of work in neural science, I think today we have almost no idea how the human brain works, and so the incredibly little we know about how the human brain works has served as loose inspiration for AI, but realistically, much more AI progress today is driven by computer science principles than by neural science principles. Having said that, AI has become incredibly good at automating things that people can do. For example, people are very good at recognizing speech, and AI speech rec falls in that. People are very good at recognizing faces. AI&#8217;s made rapid progress on that.<\/p>\n<p>It turns out that our tools for advancing a piece of AI technology tend to work better when we\u2019re trying to automate a task that a human can do, rather than try to tackle a task that even humans cannot do. And there are many reasons for this, but one of the reasons is, when we\u2019re trying to choose a task humans can do, and the AI gets involved, then it allows us to go in and try to figure out how this human has done the task more rapidly. So when I look across the many verticals of AI, we can certainly do some things that even humans aren\u2019t very good at. I think, today, Amazon probably recommends books to me even better than my wife can. My wife knows me fairly well. And this is because Amazon has ingested a ton of data about what books I browse and read on their website much more than my wife would possibly watch over my shoulder exactly what I\u2019m reading. But with a few exceptions like that, I think by and large, I feel like I\u2019m seeing this as very fast progress, when AI is trying to automate things that, at least that humans can also do.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You are always the first to be conservative in your projections about what AI can accomplish, and I assume part of the reason you do that is a memory of how excessive expectations have had catastrophic effects on the science, especially with regard to funding. Is that correct?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I tend to be very practical, and I try to be a realist. But I want to offer a slightly different perspective on that. If I set out to build a team to cure all human diseases, that would be celebrated. That sounds like a great mission to work on. But frankly, sometimes there is a cost to aiming too high, and this is an unpopular and definitely contrarian view in today&#8217;s Silicon Valley, where we like to talk about how you should aim for the moon, because even if you miss, you\u2019ll still be in the stars. But I think that, realistically, there is a cost to aiming too high, which is that, maybe, instead of building a team to solve all of the diseases in the world, it might be more productive, you might actually do more good for the world, to aim to solve malaria. So I feel like there are some very significant changes we can make to the world using AI. I think we can transform transportation through self-driving cars, but also through logistics, with AI. I think we can completely transform healthcare with AI. There are major changes we can make in the world, through AI. So a lot of my efforts are in building out toward these concrete, doable things, because I think that that&#8217;s actually more productive for the world, than spending all of our time building toward a science fiction which might not come to fruition for maybe even hundreds of years. And I get that this is an unpopular, contrarian view in Silicon Valley.<\/p>\n<p>Having said that, as a society, we should do all sorts of things. So I think the world is a better place, that we have some people working to solve malaria, and hopefully, through the work of Gates Foundations and World Health Organization, and others, maybe we&#8217;re getting real traction against malaria. We should also have some people working to solving every single human disease under the sun. I think it&#8217;s a good thing that society allocates its resources in a diverse set of ways. But I do think that it&#8217;s helpful, for the progress of our field, when we think through &#8216;what are the tasks that we are confident that we can achieve?&#8217;, versus &#8216;what are the tasks that are further-off dreams that we should invest in?&#8217; Parts of my teams do work on [these], but it&#8217;s only a fraction of our overall efforts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you believe in the possibility of a AGI and, if so, do you believe it is something that will be achieved along evolutionary paths of techniques that we know, and Moore\u2019s Law blowing at our back and all of that, or would an AGI require a whole fundamental breakthrough, something we can\u2019t even anticipate?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think achieving AGI would definitely require multiple breakthroughs. It may well happen. Both [through] software algorithmic breakthroughs and likely the hardware breakthroughs. Whether that breakthrough will come in ten or a hundred or a thousand years from now, though, I find that hard to predict.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you think that human creativity, such as the ability to write a screenplay or a great novel, does that require an AGI, or is that within our grasp, with the technology we have now?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think a lot of creativity is when we don&#8217;t understand the process by which something was created. For example, Garry Kasparov said that he saw creativity Deep Blue&#8217;s moves. And as a technologist, I know how chess programs run. Through their process of throwing an amazing amount of computation at the task, they are enabled to execute chess moves that even chess masters thought were creative. Having been involved in the creative process myself, creativity is much more hard work, and the incremental putting together of many small pieces, that builds up to a large thing that looks like it came out of nowhere. But if someone didn&#8217;t see all the small pieces, and how hard it was to assemble all the small pieces together into this creative thing, sometimes I think creativity looks more magical from the outside, than it does from the inside.<\/p>\n<p>My artist friends practice individual brush strokes, over and over, and draw similar paintings over and over, and make incremental progress. My grandmother was a painter and made incremental progress toward an amazing work of art, that when you see only the final product, rather than all of the baby steps that it took to get there, I think it feels more magical than if you were the one that had to do all the work to make all the little incremental pieces of progress.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So if reading between the lines of what you just said, human creativity is computational and attainable, on some time scale that&#8217;s reasonable. It&#8217;s not something mystical or other-worldly, that\u2019s beyond what we know how to do. Would you agree?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yeah. Either through executing the occasional brilliant chess moves, finding an interpretation of a sentence that a human hadn&#8217;t thought of before, to creating a simple work of art, I think that we&#8217;re seeing machine behavior that one could say is somewhat creative. We&#8217;ll probably continue to see incremental progress, and machines gradually becoming more &#8220;creative&#8221; over the next several years.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How is your team distributed geographically? Where are most of the people?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Mainly in Beijing. We have a team of about 100 in the United States, and then we have also large teams in Beijing, and some smaller teams in Shanghai and Shenzhen.<\/p>\n<p><strong>With robotics, you can see national and regional priorities emerging. In Japan, for instance, there&#8217;s more of an emphasis on making robots friendly, and be things that you can emotionally connect with, than in other parts of the world. Are there things like that in artificial intelligence? Because you mentioned earlier about face recognition coming out of China. Are there things in AI that different companies, or different regions, or different countries, maybe look at differently? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think face recognition is one example where economic pressures and a brilliant business model has driven a lot of progress in China. I think from the product level, the different business pressures and product priorities have caused different countries to invest more or less aggressively in different areas. Some examples in China; in China, typing Chinese characters on a cell phone keyboard is even more painful than typing English on a cell phone keyboard. So that, in turn, drove a lot of pressure for better mobile phone speech recognition. So I feel a lot of the speech recognition breakthroughs were pioneered by Baidu because of this strong product pressure to get speech recognition working for users.<\/p>\n<p>I think that machine translation \u2013 you know, actually, there&#8217;s been a lot of PR in the U.S. on neural machine translation. What many people might not be aware is that neural machine translation was first pioneered and developed, and shipped as a product in China. Large U.S. companies came later, and I think one of the reasons for this is that in China, there is a huge desire for translation of public content into Chinese, whereas in the English speaking world, there is a lot of English content. There is a lot of Chinese content as well, but foreign content gets translated into Chinese very rapidly, just as a cultural phenomenon, whereas there is so much English content in the world, I think there&#8217;s less pressure for English speakers to have access to foreign-language content.<\/p>\n<p>I think the face recognition as a business is taking off rapidly in China, because being a mobile first society, people in China are used to making significant financial transactions. For example, you can get an education loan from Baidu, and then we literally send you a lot of money, just based on your loan application that you carry out on your mobile phone. And when we&#8217;re sending someone a significant sum of money through their mobile phone, then we have a very strong interest in verifying the identity of that person. So face recognition has come to the forefront as a key technology for doing this. So those pressures mean that your face recognition is another area that I feel is taking off very fast in China, faster than other countries.<\/p>\n<p>We have a lot of innovation in AI, in both the U.S. and in China. And there are other areas, I guess. I would say that the UK has been invested heavily in AI for playing video games. I&#8217;m personally not investing in AI for playing video games, but I guess there are different interests and priorities in different organizations.<\/p>\n<p>You know, I think that AI progress today is a global phenomenon, and I feel that there&#8217;s a lot of innovation happening in China that the English-speaking world is not aware of. This is not a secrecy issue. I think it&#8217;s just a lack of fluency issue. For example, I was at the NIPS conference just a few weeks ago, and within a day of all of the most significant talks presented at NIPS, were already summarized and transcribed into Chinese, and posted online in China. So the transfer of knowledge from an English-language speaking conference in Barcelona, into the Chinese language, was very fast and very efficient where, within a day, many researchers in China could read, in Chinese, what was presented in English, in Spain. I think the fact that many people in China speak and read English fluently, makes this possible.<\/p>\n<p>I think that, unfortunately, transfer of knowledge in the opposite direction is much slower, just because when you look globally, many researchers today, outside of China, do not speak Chinese. So there are many things that are invented, even widely publicized in China, that the English-speaking audience does not find out about, sometimes even for a year, until an English-speaking company invents something similar. So I think that one of the things I hope I can do is help with increasing the velocity of knowledge transfer in the opposite direction, as well, because if we can make the research community a more global one, then I think the whole global research community will advance fast.<\/p>\n<p>And I think there is some specific examples. I think that it was first in China, that Mandarin language speech recognition for short phrases surpassed human level recognition over a year ago, but somehow this result wasn&#8217;t widely known globally, until more recently. I&#8217;ve seen many examples, ranging from advances in speech recognition to advances in neural machine translation, to advances in building up GPU processes for deep learning that were first invented in China, but that I wish had made it to the U.S. sooner as well, after its initial invention in China.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are there any sites or periodicals, that you would suggest to our readers, so that they can find information like easier?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Knowledge in China is disseminated in ways that are different than in the U.S. AI knowledge is disseminated very rapidly on social media in China, in a way that&#8217;s very intense, and is hard to understand if you haven&#8217;t experienced it yourself. And then I would say there are many websites, as well, but a lot of these are Chinese language websites. Follow me on Twitter. I&#8217;ll see what I can do.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you have an opinion what human consciousness is? Or more specifically, do you believe human consciousness is fundamentally computational?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what consciousness is. In philosophy, there&#8217;s a debate about whether the people around you are really conscious, or they&#8217;re just zombies, or automatons that through computation are acting as if they are conscious. After all, how do we know if anyone other than ourselves is truly conscious, or if they&#8217;re an automaton?

It is now a question of tactics \u2014 how, when, and what kind? Cloud computing increasingly forms an integral part of enterprise IT strategy, but the wide variation in enterprise requirements ensures plenty of scope for very different cloud services to coexist.<\/p>\n<p>Today\u2019s enterprise cloud deployments will typically be hybridized, with applications and workloads running in a mix of different cloud environments.

Remember, an attacked only has to find one opening. The owner of the system has to protect every opening.<\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.5\">Will hackers eventually shut down hospitals, break into our medical devices and inflict physical harm on people?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Eventually? Actually, this is old news. In the last few months Hollywood, CA Presbyterian Medical Center paid $17,000 in bitcoin to ransomware hackers, MedStar Health reported malware had caused a shutdown of some systems at its hospitals in Baltimore, and Methodist Hospital and Prime Healthcare both had phishing-based ransomware attacks. There are many reasons why hospitals are the perfect targets for ransomware and other types of attacks. Hospitals have long build applications with an emphasis on speed an available, as opposed to security.\u00a0That makes sense, as an emergency room physician shouldn\u2019t have to search for their SecurID token to use the defibrillator.\u00a0\u00a0The downside to that is the easy access approach to defibrillators often translates into easy access to master patient databases.\u00a0\u00a0For a large medical center, that means that millions of records are at risk due to lax information security controls.<\/p>\n<p>Balancing ease of use and strong security controls is a challenge, but acutely so in the medical field.<\/p>\n<p>As to medical devices, some of the manufacturers thought their information security people were as smart as their pharmaceutical engineers. The reality was at times not like that and medical devices were produced without effective security controls.<\/p>\n<p>The following horror story is not atypical: when I was at\u00a0British Telecom Professional Services, we had proposed a large project to assist a cardiac device manufacturer with their product.\u00a0Bruce Schneier was with BT at the time and was in a speaking tour of Europe.\u00a0We arranged that Bruce would stop there and give them an hour-long briefing on the importance of medical device security.

Linthicum:<\/p>\n<p>The emerging bare metal cloud market provides a way to complement or substitute virtualized cloud services with a dedicated server environment. In other words, it\u2019s a cloud service that maps to a dedicated physical server, and businesses are the exclusive owner of that service for the duration that it\u2019s needed. It\u2019s as if the dedicated physical server is an owned server. A business can access and leverage most native features of that platform, including accessing memory and storage subsystems directly without having to go through a cloud API.<\/p>\n<p>This report will help IT executives and enterprise architects evaluate bare metal\u00a0as an option for specific workloads, such as those that are durable over a long period of time, have stable workload characteristics (no need to scale up or down), are sensitive to performance latencies, and are I\/O intensive. Workloads such as big data systems, backup and recovery services, and applications that often go to and from storage are the best candidates for bare metal clouds.<\/p>\n<p>To read the full report, <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/report\/leveraging-bare-metal-clouds\/\">click here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our library of 1700 research reports\u00a0is\u00a0available only to our subscribers.\u00a0We occasionally\u00a0release ones for our larger audience to benefit from.

Simply put, code backed by a certificate is supposed to guarantee the software has not been altered since it was signed.<\/p>\n<p>However, bad actors have usurped the validity of signed code by compromising the private keys behind those certificates or by falsifying information to request a valid certificate. Either way, that spells big trouble for those looking to avoid malicious code or other nefarious activities caused by what was thought to be a legitimate piece of application code.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, malicious code can now enter an enterprise by masquerading as legitimate, safe code, creating a significant problem that digitally signed code was designed to prevent. What\u2019s more, those bits of digitally signed code is growing exponentially, backed by <a href=\"https:\/\/iapp.org\/media\/pdf\/resource_center\/Ponemon_cost_of_failed_trust_report_2016.pdf\">Ponemon Institute research<\/a> that shows 58% of security teams need to better secure their keys and certificates.<\/p>\n<p>With the realization that code-signing certificate misuse is on the rise, organizations including Certificate Authorities (CAs) and application software suppliers (most notably, Microsoft) came together to develop a new standard, which goes into effect February 1, 2017. The new standard, which is defined as the <a href=\"http:\/\/aka.ms\/csbr\">Minimum Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly Trusted Code Signing Certificates<\/a>, requires that all CAs in the Microsoft Trusted Root Certificates must be adhered to, if they issue code signing certificates.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/casecurity.org\/\">CA Security Council<\/a> member, Bruce Morton, explains \u201cMinimum Requirements for Code Signing will increase Internet security by setting a new bar to prevent private keys from being compromised. The requirements will also provide a better mechanism to have code signing certificates revoked limiting the proliferation of malware.&#8221; The result will benefit application software suppliers, online businesses, and of course, software users globally.<\/p>\n<p>Morton, who is also Director, Certificate Technology and Standards at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrustdatacard.com\/\">Entrust Datacard<\/a>, adds \u201cThe major problem with code signing is attackers can sign malware with a valid code signing certificate which is trusted because the code can be authenticated.\u201d Morton added \u201cThe issue is due to two problems. The first of which is when dishonest authors or publishers, request a code signing certificate. The second being when honest authors and publishers have their private signing key compromised.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Morton also explained how the new standards address those issues, as well as others, by placing more emphasis on the critical elements that surround the validation of code signing, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Identity Verification: <\/strong>Verification of an organization\u2019s identity has taken advantage of the CA\/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements, which has been proven to be reliable since implementation in 2012. Vetting of individuals includes review of government-issued photo ID or having the certificate request signed using a personnel certificate which has been validated using accepted validation processes. The applicant\u2019s identity validation process must use a high-risk request process. The CAs are to check databases of known or suspected producers, publishers or distributors of suspect code that have been developed by anti-malware organizations and application software providers. CAs must also maintain and check an internal database that lists revoked certificates used to sign suspect code and previously rejected certificate requests.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Key Compromise:<\/strong> Key compromise has been addressed by first setting a minimum key size to: 2048-bit RSA or to ECC curves NIST P-256, P-384 and P-521. The maximum validity period for a code signing certificate will be 39 months with the goal of changing the key with every certificate renewal. Private keys must now be protected on hardware or kept in a device separate from the host of the signing function. Hardware encryption can be done in a FIPS 140-2 Level 2 certified hardware security module or Common Criteria equivalent, or on a trusted platform module (TPM). Hardware encryption is mandatory if the publisher has a history with takeover attacks. That is, if the publisher\u2019s key has been compromised by means of fraud, theft, malicious or illegal conduct, then the key must be encrypted. A method for the publisher to mitigate key compromise is to use a signing service. In this case, a signing authority will generate and manage the signing key, typically in a hardware security module. Publishers requesting to sign code must have multi-factor authentication. The result is the keys are kept protected and are not available to be shared in the publisher\u2019s environment.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Certificate Revocation: <\/strong>In the event of suspect code being signed, the code signing certificate will have to be revoked. The publisher may find out that their key has been compromised and will directly request revocation. In other cases, other parties such as an application software supplier may find signed malware. In this case, the software supplier can contact the CA directly and request the certificate to be revoked. The standard provides procedures for investigation and CA response times. Revocation information must be provided by OCSP and may also be provided by CRL. OCSP responses must be updated at least every four days and the response must expire within 10 days.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Time-stamping:<\/strong> CAs are required to provide a Time-Stamp Authority (TSA). Time-stamping code signing signatures provide the exact time of signing. At the time the code signing software is performing the signature, it will send a token to the TSA. The TSA will add a time-stamp, hash and sign with its private key. The time-stamp signature can be validated with the time-stamp certificate and the signing time will be known. A great advantage of using time-stamps is gained during code signing certificate revocation. For instance, the code signing keys may have been used to sign valid code, then were used to sign malware. The code signing certificate must be revoked to remove trust from the signed malware. But what about the valid code? The standard allows the publisher to choose a revocation date enabling the publisher to choose a revocation date after the valid code was signed and before the malware was signed. All code time-stamped before the revocation date would be trusted, but not the code that followed the date. In addition, the code signature would be valid until the time-stamp certificate has expired. The new stand provides requirements for time-stamp CAs, time-stamp certificates and TSAs. Included in these requirements is a maximum validity period of 135 months for time-stamps. This should allow code signing signatures to remain valid for more than 10 years.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The requirements outlined above should go a long way towards preventing malicious code from benefiting by usurping CA requirements, and should bring a quick end to falsely signed code.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With the realization that code-signing certificate misuse is on the rise<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8020068,"featured_media":952854,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[359235378,359217184,40136344,29384480,5494158],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/952853"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8020068"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=952853"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/952853\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/952854"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=952853"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=952853"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=952853"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":951937,"date":"2017-01-05T07:00:59","date_gmt":"2017-01-05T13:00:59","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=951937"},"modified":"2017-01-09T11:32:15","modified_gmt":"2017-01-09T17:32:15","slug":"report-best-practices-and-technologies-for-cloud-api-management-and-governance","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2017\/01\/05\/report-best-practices-and-technologies-for-cloud-api-management-and-governance\/","title":{"rendered":"Report: Best practices and technologies for cloud API management and governance"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Our library of 1700 research reports\u00a0is\u00a0available only to our subscribers.\u00a0We occasionally\u00a0release ones for our larger audience to benefit from.

Linthicum:<\/p>\n<p>Cloud computing\u2019s continued growth has led to an increase in the use of APIs, which can abstract the complexities of back-end resources such as databases, platforms, storage, compute, and middleware. APIs provide developers and users with the ability to leverage and releverage services, allowing enterprise IT to construct applications from prebuilt component parts.<\/p>\n<p>However, the number of APIs that exist within public cloud providers, or even around traditional enterprise systems, continues to increase well beyond most enterprises\u2019 ability to manually manage them. What\u2019s needed to address this is a new approach and a new technology to manage and govern these services. The use of API management and governance technology is the most logical path, but planning and deployment best practices are still required.<\/p>\n<p>In this report, we\u2019ll explore the concept of API management and governance, and look at its purpose and value as well as the details behind planning and deployment.<\/p>\n<p>To read the full report, <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/report\/best-practices-and-technologies-for-cloud-api-management-and-governance\/\">click here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our library of 1700 research reports\u00a0is\u00a0available only to our subscribers.\u00a0We occasionally\u00a0release ones for our larger audience to benefit from.

Who bears the burden of the crime or wrongdoing?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I recently got the chance to respond to a short story by a science fiction writer I admire. The author, Paulo Bacigalupi, imagines a detective investigating the \u201cmurder\u201d of a man by his artificial companion. The robot insists it killed its owner intentionally in retaliation for abuse and demands a lawyer.<\/p>\n<p>Today\u2019s robots are not likely to be held legally responsible for their actions. The interesting question is whether anyone will be. If a driverless car crashes, we can treat the car like a defective product and sue the manufacturer. But where a robot causes a truly unexpected harm, the law will struggle. Criminal law looks for <em>mens rea<\/em>, meaning intent. And tort law looks for foreseeability.<\/p>\n<p>If a robot behaves in a way no one intended or foresaw, we might have a victim with no perpetrator. This could happen more and more as robots gain greater sophistication and autonomy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do tricky problems in cyber law and robotics law keep you awake at night?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes: intermediary liability. Personal computers and smart phones are useful precisely because developers other than the manufacturer can write apps for them. Neither Apple nor Google developed Pokemon Go. But who should be responsible if an app steals your data or a person on Facebook defames you? Courts and lawmakers decided early on that the intermediary\u2014the Apple or Facebook\u2014would not be liable for what people did with the platform.<\/p>\n<p>The same may not be true for robots. Personal robotics, like personal computers, is likely to rise or fall on the ingenuity of third party developers. But when bones instead of bits are on the line\u2014when the software you download can touch you\u2014courts are likely to strike a different balance. Assuming, as I do, that the future of robotics involves robot app stores, I am quite concerned that the people that make robots will not open them up to innovation due to the uncertainty of whether they will be held responsible if someone gets hurt.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Would prosecution against someone who harms a robotic be different than someone who harms a non-thinking or non-intelligent piece of machinery?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It could be. The link between animal abuse and child abuse, for instance, is so strong that many jurisdictions require authorities responding to an animal abuse allegation to alert child protective services if kids are in the house. Robots elicit very strong social reactions. There are reports of soldiers risking their lives on the battlefield to rescue a robot. In Japan, people have funerals for robotic dogs. We might wonder about a person who abuses a machine that feels like a person or a pet. And, eventually, we might decide to enhance penalties for destroying or defacing a robot beyond what we usually levy for vandalism. Kate Darling has an interesting paper on this.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Should citizens be concerned about robotic devices in their home compromising their privacy or about hackers attacking medical their medial devices? How legitimate or illegitimate are people\u2019s fears about the rise of technology?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>People should be concerned about robots and artificial intelligence but not necessarily for the reasons they read about in the press. Kate Crawford of Microsoft Research and I have been thinking through how society\u2019s emphasis on the possibility of the Singularity or a Terminator distorts the debate surrounding the social impact of AI. Some think that superintelligent AI could be humankind\u2019s \u201clast invention.\u201d Many serious computer scientists working in the field scoff at this, pointing out that AI and robotics are technologies still in their infancy. But despite AI\u2019s limits, these same experts advocate introducing AI into some of our most sensitive social contexts such as criminal justice, finance, and healthcare. As my colleague Pedro Domingos puts it: The problem isn\u2019t that AI is too smart and will take over the world. It\u2019s that it is too stupid and already has.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/Ryan-Calo.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-950798 size-medium\" title=\"https:\/\/www.law.washington.edu\/directory\/Profile.aspx?ID=713\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/Ryan-Calo-199x300.jpg\" alt=\"Ryan Calo\" width=\"199\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/Ryan-Calo-199x300.jpg 199w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/Ryan-Calo-768x1156.jpg 768w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/Ryan-Calo-452x680.jpg 452w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/Ryan-Calo-968x1457.jpg 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/Ryan-Calo-93x140.jpg 93w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/Ryan-Calo-997x1500.jpg 997w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/Ryan-Calo-17x25.jpg 17w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/Ryan-Calo-33x50.jpg 33w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/Ryan-Calo-300x451.jpg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/Ryan-Calo-320x482.jpg 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/Ryan-Calo-640x963.jpg 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/Ryan-Calo-804x1210.jpg 804w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px\" \/><\/a>\n<p>Ryan Calo is a law professor at the University of Washington and faculty co-director of the Tech Policy Lab, a unique, interdisciplinary research unit that spans the School of Law, Information School, and Department of Computer Science and Engineering.

Although large organizations are now showing real signs of adopting cloud computing as part of their IT estate, most cloud-based deployments still tend to be either for new and self-contained projects or to meet the needs of traditional development and testing functions.<\/p>\n<p>Compatibility, interoperability, and performance concerns have kept IT administrators from being completely comfortable with the idea of moving their complex core applications to the cloud. And without a seamless application migration blueprint, the project can seem more of a headache \u2013 and risk \u2013 than it&#8217;s worth. This report will highlight for systems administrators, IT directors, cloud architects, and decision-makers at Software as a Service (SaaS) companies and Cloud Service providers, the different approaches they can take in moving existing applications to the cloud.<\/p>\n<p>To read the full report, <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/report\/how-to-resolve-cloud-migration-challenges-in-physical-and-virtual-applications\/\">click here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our library of 1700 research reports\u00a0is\u00a0available only to our subscribers.\u00a0We occasionally\u00a0release ones for our larger audience to benefit from.

That trend, powered by a feedback loop based upon false metrics, will likely accelerate the populace of Ads while also tremendously weakening the value.<\/p>\n<p>Those false metrics may spur a death spiral for online marketing ideologies, such as AdWords and ad links, resulting in a dramatic shift in how advertisers reach out to potential customers and even change the way how Ads are measured for value.<\/p>\n<p>The catalyst behind that potential paradigm shift comes from the age-old problem of fraud, in this case, ad fraud. Even so, most still wonder how fraud can impact a well-managed advertising campaign, and others wonder if Ad fraud could have lasting repercussions.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere are many different types of digital ad fraud\u201d said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/augustinefou\">Dr. Augustine Fou<\/a>, an expert on Cybersecurity and Ad Fraud. Fou added \u201chowever, ad fraud has a different impact on advertisers than it has on end users.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, ad fraud can impact customers by gathering personal information, or directing those customers to malware sites, or even become the catalyst for phishing attacks or identity theft. While for businesses, ad fraud creates a whole different set of liabilities.<\/p>\n<p>Fou said \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/augustinefou\/state-of-digital-ad-fraud-2017-by-augustine-fou\/1\">recent research<\/a> shows that Ad fraud can be a lucrative proposition for those looking to benefit from it.\u201d \u00a0Fou added &#8220;ad fraud is at an<a href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/augustinefou\/state-of-digital-ad-fraud-2017-by-augustine-fou\/7\"> all-time high<\/a>&#8220;,\u00a0and due to its ease of scale, growing exponentially. While those observations may give many pause, the simple truth of the matter is that those paying for ads will feel the most pain initially.<\/p>\n<p>The issue for advertisers comes down to one of measuring value. After all, advertisers expect some return on their investments, and that return in the online world is measured by page views and impressions. Elements that are carefully measured, packaged up, and delivered to advertisers to assuage nervous budget managers.<\/p>\n<p>However, far too much faith is being put into the statistics offered, simply because ad fraud has its roots in falsifying website traffic to inflate visits measured. That fraudulent reporting in perpetuated by \u201cbots\u201d, which in turn are programmed to effectively mimic human behavior.<\/p>\n<p>In many cases advertisers are paying for ad impressions, which are actually fueled by bots. That creates a situation where the statistics are actually useless, and advertisers have become the victims of fraud, all without any accountability on the provider\u2019s side. This in fact has become a lucrative business for many of those selling online Ads, one that shows crime can pay.<\/p>\n<p>And therein is the real rub \u2013 advertisers keep pouring money into online advertising campaigns, only to see a rapidly diminishing return on investments. As this situation continues throughout 2017, marketing departments are going to start taking a closer look at how they spend their ad budgets, as they should, and online advertising will be seriously impacted.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ad fraud is on the rise, and nothing good will come from it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8020068,"featured_media":952847,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[26774178,359257131,104422,27320,359257130],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/952846"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8020068"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=952846"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/952846\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/952847"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=952846"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=952846"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=952846"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":951932,"date":"2017-01-03T07:00:04","date_gmt":"2017-01-03T13:00:04","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=951932"},"modified":"2017-01-09T11:33:36","modified_gmt":"2017-01-09T17:33:36","slug":"report-how-to-deliver-a-comprehensive-big-data-analytics-framework-to-communication-service-providers","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2017\/01\/03\/report-how-to-deliver-a-comprehensive-big-data-analytics-framework-to-communication-service-providers\/","title":{"rendered":"Report: How to deliver a comprehensive big data analytics framework to communication service providers"},"content":{"rendered":"<div dir=\"ltr\">Our library of 1700 research reports is\u00a0available only to our subscribers.

The traditional model of competing on subscription plans is no longer an adequate business strategy. Since most internal systems were built with this model in mind, these environments, with non-enriched, non-integrated, and latent data, fit for after-the-fact reporting, are struggling to keep up with the changes.<\/p>\n<p>This research report will explain how CSPs establish a framework for their analytics as well as review the business drivers for telcos and the key benefits that big data analytics provide. It will also address the impact of the business drivers and the advantages of streaming analytics, combined with the ability to harness big data to meet several CSP competitive requirements. It will conclude by summarizing this comprehensive big data analytics framework for CSPs.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>To read the full report, <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/report\/how-to-deliver-a-comprehensive-big-data-analytics-framework-to-communication-service-providers\/\">click here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our library of 1700 research reports is\u00a0available only to our subscribers.

Can AI be designed from scratch, via logic, like IBM\u2019s Watson? In that case we might use \u201claws\u201d like Asimov predicted, to try to keep control. But there are five other general approaches and the lesson when you study them is that \u201ccontrol\u201d just may not be in the cards.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why are you a proponent of radical transparency, and do you believe that our world is moving in that direction?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A great many modern citizens are rightfully worried about Big Brother. Some fear tyranny coming from snooty academics and faceless government bureaucrats. Others see Orwellian despots arising from conniving aristocrats and faceless corporations. They are <em>all<\/em> right to worry! Because across 6000 years, only rarely was something other than feudalism or dictatorship tried. Our experiment has been by far the most successful of those exceptions and we should study why.<\/p>\n<p>We did not achieve this by hiding. Those who fret that governments and corporations and the rich will know too much about us &#8212; these folks are right to worry, but they reach the wrong conclusion. We will never successfully hide from elites. It never happened and never will. \u201cEncryption\u201d and other romantic fantasies never work for very long. But there is another approach. Not to <em>hide,<\/em> but to aggressively strip all elites naked enough to supervise them and hold them accountable. We may not be able to stop them from <em>knowing<\/em> about us. But we can still deter them from <em>doing<\/em> bad things to us.<\/p>\n<p>That is how we got our current freedom, by answering surveillance with <em>sousveillance,<\/em> or supervising authority. Proof of this is the spread of video and cell phone cameras on our streets, which are cornering abuses by authorities and year by year making it harder for them to do bad things. It\u2019s not perfect. It never will be. But the Moore\u2019s Law of Cameras \u2013 (sometimes called \u201cBrin\u2019s Corollary to Moore\u2019s Law\u201d I\u2019m told) \u2013 seems to be providing citizens with a Great Equalizer, even better than the old Colt 45. This runs diametrically opposite to the Hollywood lesson that technology never works in favor of citizenship. It can and it does.<\/p>\n<p>In any event, the spread of cameras \u2013 faster, better, cheaper, more mobile, and vastly more numerous \u2013 cannot be stopped. If the elites monopolize this light, we <em>will<\/em> have Big Brother. But if citizens grab the light, then BB hasn\u2019t a chance.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are your biggest concerns surrounding developments in artificial intelligence, if any?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Anything done in secret is more likely to result in terrible errors. Secrecy is the underlying mistake that makes every innovation go wrong, in Michael Crichton novels and films! If AI happens in the open, then errors and flaws may be discovered in time\u2026 perhaps by other, wary AIs!<\/p>\n<p>Hence, the branch of AI research I fear most is High Frequency Trading (HFT) programs. Wall Street firms have poured more money into this particular realm of AI research than is spent by all of the top universities, combined. Notably, HFT systems are designed in utter secrecy, evading normal feedback loops of scientific criticism and peer-review. Moreover the ethos designed into these mostly unsupervised systems is inherently parasitical, predatory, amoral (at-best) and insatiable.<\/p>\n<p>Not only are they a potential disaster, waiting to happen\u2026 they can only <em>possibly<\/em> lead to disaster. No other outcome is even remotely plausible.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why do some people fear AI? Is some amount of caution called for? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We fear that advanced, super-intelligent and powerful entities will do to us what <em>human<\/em> high achievers always did in the past. They took over our tribes, nations and so on, making themselves kings and lords and priests and tyrants, bossing over us and limiting the potential of those below. Adam Smith wrote that such inherited oligarchies were always far deadlier enemies of creative and competitive, flat-open-fair enterprise than government civil servants can ever be.<\/p>\n<p>Especially, because they suppressed criticism, those feudal kings and lords became very, very bad rulers, performing horrifically stupid statecraft while deeming themselves to be so smart. It\u2019s no accident that human civilization only started taking off when we discovered tricks for preventing that failure mode\u2026 for keeping things flat-open-fair-competitive.<\/p>\n<p>If new AI minds truly are super intelligent, then they will see what a mistake it would be to emulate that hoary old pattern. What a blunder, if they copy the approach used by puerile-dopey human lords. In my novel EXISTENCE, I explore how AI might choose to take a very different approach than we have seen portrayed in real life or in films.<\/p>\n<p>Now, if only the new AI overlords will read what I wrote, before deciding\u2026<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/david-brin.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-950761\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/david-brin-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"david brin\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/david-brin-300x299.jpg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/david-brin-768x766.jpg 768w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/david-brin-680x678.jpg 680w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/david-brin-85x85.jpg 85w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/david-brin-50x50.jpg 50w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/david-brin-180x180.jpg 180w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/david-brin-600x600.jpg 600w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/david-brin-968x965.jpg 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/david-brin-140x140.jpg 140w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/david-brin-48x48.jpg 48w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/david-brin-25x25.jpg 25w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/david-brin-320x319.jpg 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/david-brin-640x638.jpg 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/david-brin-804x802.jpg 804w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/09\/david-brin.jpg 1136w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.davidbrin.com\">David Brin<\/a> is an astrophysicist whose international best-selling novels include The Postman, Earth, and recently Existence.

How do you envision robots to be used in people\u2019s everyday lives?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Recent years have seen major advances in fields that are vital for producing useful robots. Computer vision researchers are developing algorithms that allow machines to \u201csee\u201d increasingly more like humans. Experts in manipulation and control are creating increasingly more agile robots that can do increasingly more dexterous tasks. Research in natural language processing is creating intuitive ways for machines and humans to interact.<\/p>\n<p>Taken all together, this work has gotten us closer than ever to a world where robots will be able to help us with everything from space exploration and search-and-rescue operations to manufacturing and folding our laundry!<\/p>\n<p>Robots will help with physical tasks in a way that is analogous to how smartphones help with computational and data tasks. Imagine a world where anyone can design and build their own robot, customized for their needs. This would could create a whole new industry of \u201c24-hour manufacturing\u201d &#8211; people could go to a 24-hour robot-manufacturing store to customize a robot to their own needs.<\/p>\n<p>For example, say you want to retrieve a ring from a vent, or tidy the toys on your floor. From this task specification, the store will be able to create a robot quickly and at low cost. We do not have these capabilities today, but we are developing technologies that will someday enable us to create our own robots like that.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How do you create limits that safeguard humans against being harmed by robots?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We need technological solutions and policies. We should always be cognizant of new technologies\u2019 potential for both good and bad. When airbags came out, many people were understandably concerned that they occasionally malfunctioned, causing injuries or worse. But we now accept that the many lives that airbags save far outweigh the harm they cause.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that in the coming years we will go through a similar process with robots. That said, I\u2019m glad that there has been a healthy debate to make sure that we implement clear guidelines on robotic technologies and how they are used.<\/p>\n<p>My team is acutely aware of the fact that traditional factory robots are caged to make sure that we are safe around them. Our recent research has explored the potential of soft-bodied robots, which we think could be a safer alternative. (For certain tasks, they might even be more effective, since their agility lets them change direction and squeeze into tight spaces.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>How can American workers prepare themselves for careers in technology? How can people already in career paths who have already been working for 10, 20, 30 years keep from getting left behind?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Rapid progress in computing over the past 50 years has made it so that we simply cannot live without computers today. The world is undergoing a big change in the nature of work, and we need to adapt to this change and be tech-literate. Although technology is developing rapidly and the jobs are also changing, the job changes are more gradual. This means we should be concerned about the young generation and make sure that they learn the skills required in the future.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, with online education I believe that it\u2019s never been easier to pick up new skills even when you\u2019re a decade or two past your college years. Companies like edX offer many courses to keep you up to speed on emerging technologies and skills. In the last couple years we\u2019ve created several courses aimed directly at working professionals who want to learn the latest skills in <a href=\"https:\/\/mitprofessionalx.mit.edu\/courses\/course-v1:MITProfessionalX+6.BDX+T3_2016\/about\">big data<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/mitprofessionalx.mit.edu\/courses\/course-v1:MITProfessionalX+CSx+2016_T2\/about\">cybersecurity<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/mitprofessionalx.mit.edu\/courses\/course-v1:MITProfessionalX+IOTx+2016_T2\/about\">the Internet of Things<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As more jobs require using computers in complex ways, we have to address the knowledge gap in teaching coding. I think that this means not just \u201clearning to code,\u201d but what you might call \u201ccoding to learn\u201d &#8211; learning these skills not merely as an end in itself, but to look at the world in a different way.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What advancements in robotics do you expect to see in your lifetime?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Robots will be able to help us with physical tasks big and small. I think we\u2019re only a few years away from a world where you will be able to walk into a store and order your own robot for specific tasks around the home or office.<\/p>\n<p>For example, I believe that artificial intelligence will transform transportation profoundly. In the next decade we will see more customized and safer transportation with autonomous and near-autonomous technologies doing a lot of the heavy lifting with getting people and packages around, whether by train, plane or car.<\/p>\n<p>One challenge to making robots commonplace is that they take a long time to design and build. Today\u2019s fabrication processes are slow and costly, with even one small change resulting in days or even weeks of lost time to re-evaluate the designs.<\/p>\n<p>My team is among many around the globe who is working to develop systems that let you design robots more quickly. In our case, we have developed an interface that lets you design a robot in just a few minutes, to be 3D-printed in a matter of hours.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/image001-e1475695075506.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-951026\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/image001-200x300.png\" alt=\"http:\/\/danielarus.csail.mit.edu\/\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a>\n<p>Daniela Rus is the Andrew (1956) and Erna Viterbi Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Director of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT.\u00a0 Rus&#8217;s research interests are in robotics, mobile computing, and data science.

This principle, I believe, is fundamental to why we will fail to see the ultimate vision of artificial intelligence (which I first studied at university 30 years ago) become reality, perhaps for some decades.<\/p>\n<p>So, what is driving the \u2018law\u2019? Most simply that Moore\u2019s Law, which states that the number of transistors on a chip will double periodically, is not the only principle at play. Other principles are economic, contextual and consequences of the way we choose to create data. While I haven\u2019t done the maths, here are some of the reasons why Jonno\u2019s first law will continue to apply:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Data creation requires less processing than data interpretation.<\/strong>\u00a0Data is easy to generate from even the least smart of sensors. It is also easy to duplicate with minimal processing and\/or power, as illustrated by passive RFID tags and \u2018smart\u2019 paving slabs.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Corollary:<\/strong>\u00a0A small modification in a complex data set can difficult to represent as the differences from the original data set, meaning it is more likely to result in two complex data sets.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>There is always more data to be captured.\u00a0<\/strong>Current business approaches are based on gaining an advantage based on accumulating more data. Equally, human desire to progress implies higher quality images and frame rates, larger screens, more detailed information from manufacturing systems and so on.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Corollary:\u00a0<\/strong>The universe cannot be measured molecule by molecule \u2013 it is too vast, the data set too big to capture without a similarly vast set of measures. Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty principle comes into play both at the lowest level and in how captured data influences human behaviour.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>The number of data generators is increasing faster than processors.<\/strong>\u00a0For example, digital cameras and indeed, mobile phones are being used in the main for content generation. 100 million servers exist in the world, compared to 10 billion phones.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Corollary:<\/strong>\u00a0While processing continues to commoditise, data generation continues to fragment. Cloud computing manifests the former, and consumers, the latter.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Current models charge less (or zero) for data generation, more for processing.<\/strong>\u00a0Consumer-oriented data generation is paid for by advertising, which covers its costs but leaves little for large-scale processing of the information.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Corollary:<\/strong>\u00a0Consumer-based data generation is fragmented due to competitive interests, as multiple organisations (Facebook, Amazon) are growing their businesses primarily through data accumulation and secondarily interpretation.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Many algorithms are only recently becoming feasible.<\/strong>\u00a0Much of the mathematics around current AI, machine learning and so on is well established, but processing was too expensive to handle it until recently. The potential of such algorithms is still being worked through, therefore.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Corollary:\u00a0<\/strong>The algorithms we use are based on human understanding, not computer understanding.

After all, there are countless applications that ultimately interact with a database at one point or another, and most any of those interactions can be the basis for an attack, breach or other nefarious activity.<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, monitoring without intelligence, specifically machine intelligence, does little to prevent breaches or other attacks. Simply put, DAM needs to be reactive, or better yet, proactive in its operations. What\u2019s more, DAM also needs to be further empowered by eliminating the need for agents or other software shims to be installed on database servers.<\/p>\n<p>That said, the holy grail of database protection may come in the form of DAM married to an agentless platform that employs Artificial Intelligence (AI). That solution can proactively deal with threats to databases, at least that is what<a href=\"http:\/\/www.dbnetworks.com\/\"> DB Networks<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cyberark.com\/\">CyberArk<\/a> have come to believe, as evidenced by a recent partnership by the two IT security companies.<\/p>\n<p>That partnership has resulted in DB Networks combining its<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/09\/27\/dbnetworksrev\/\"> DBN-6300 <\/a>database monitoring and security technology with CyberArk Privileged Account Security Solution, which resulted in a next generation DAM Solution. Ideally, the partnership will improve an organizations\u2019 overall security posture by creating a solution that integrates agentless DAM with AI to deliver vastly improved control over privileged access to data.<\/p>\n<p>GigaOM had the opportunity to discuss the potential of AI powered agentless DAM with DB Networks\u2019 Chairman and CEO Brett Helm, and Adam Bosnian, executive vice president, global business development at CyberArk.<\/p>\n<p>Helm pointed out how critical DAM technology has become, especially to businesses adhering to compliance regulations. Helm said \u201cDAMs are often used as a compensating control for compliance. For example, DAMs support Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) to ensure the accuracy of financial reports, Payment Card Industry\u2019s Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) for monitoring access to credit card related information, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements for monitoring access to sensitive healthcare records.\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>However, the current implementation of DAM solutions is anything but bulletproof. Helm added \u201cThird-party DAM agents\u2019 integration with Database Management System have long been an issue. When the DAM agent fails, the entire database can be brought off-line for an extended period of time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the best example of that failure comes in the form of a recent security exception, which involved 156 databases at a very large credit card processor last summer. What\u2019s more, other failures have been documented, where the DAM agents failed in such a way that no audit records were captured for months, and were only discovered during an audit. Situations such as those can result in compliance violations, extensive fines, and lost business, all without the data to properly discover what exactly happened.<\/p>\n<p>In light of those events, privileged account management and compliance specific controls have become even more important. Bosnian said \u201cPrivileged account management, especially for databases, is critical for security and is also a well-established compliance requirement. The only way to properly address those needs is with a single point of control for privileged sessions, paired with an indexed, tamper-proof record of privileged sessions. Those capabilities enable organizations to easily isolate, monitor, record and control privileged sessions on critical systems and databases. Security teams are able to immediately terminate suspicious privileged sessions and view full video playback of specific user sessions.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Helm added \u201cThe reason many databases operate unmonitored and unprotected is often because organizations lack easy-to-implement tools and trained staff. Our new agentless DAM with its machine learning together with comprehensive privileged account security has significantly simplified and enhanced database monitoring and security.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The new solution offered by DB Networks and CyberArk protects Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and Sybase database management systems. The agentless DAM operates non-intrusively and can even be deployed in conjunction with other vendor DAMs to provide an unprecedented level of database security.<\/p>\n<p>The DB Networks agentless DAM is available today from DB Networks and from authorized resellers. Pricing is dependent on capacity requirements, with volume discounts available.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p> The holy grail of database protection may come in the form of DAM married to an agentless platform that employs Artificial Intelligence (AI)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8020068,"featured_media":700989,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[359216901,359256583,85113,359256664,317587,359256663,359256593,359216754],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951908"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8020068"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=951908"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951908\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/700989"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=951908"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=951908"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=951908"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":951816,"date":"2016-12-19T10:32:29","date_gmt":"2016-12-19T16:32:29","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=951816"},"modified":"2017-01-03T16:57:38","modified_gmt":"2017-01-03T22:57:38","slug":"baidus-andrew-ng-to-speak-at-gigaom-ai-now","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/12\/19\/baidus-andrew-ng-to-speak-at-gigaom-ai-now\/","title":{"rendered":"Baidu\u2019s Andrew Ng to speak at Gigaom AI"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><img src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/andrew_ng1-275x300.jpg\" alt=\"andrew_ng1\" width=\"275\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-951810\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/andrew_ng1-275x300.jpg 275w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/andrew_ng1-128x140.jpg 128w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/andrew_ng1-23x25.jpg 23w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/andrew_ng1-46x50.jpg 46w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/andrew_ng1-300x327.jpg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/andrew_ng1-320x349.jpg 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/andrew_ng1.jpg 398w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px\" \/>We are excited to announce that <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/ai\/#speakers\">Dr. Andrew Ng<\/a><\/strong> will be speaking at <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/ai\/\">Gigaom AI<\/a><\/strong> in San Francisco in February.

What changes have you seen in education since founding Udacity, and how do you expect education to transform in your lifetime?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In the future, education will shift from once-in-a-lifetime to lifelong. We are already seeing an increasing number of people demanding new education and new credentials as they walk through life. In the tech space, Udacity has become the go-to place for millions of people, not least because of our very strong ties to the tech industry, who eagerly hires our graduates. I also believe the sky-high tuition fees of existing universities will crumble.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Considering the potential job loss that we will experience as AI and robotics industries progress, how should education change? What jobs should our children prepare for?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Technology is moving faster and faster. People live longer and longer. So this means education has to become lifelong. For our kids, more than any math or language skill will be the skill of learning to learn. The next generation has to make mental growth and lifelong learning a core component of their lives.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How do you believe that AI can positively enrich human life? What is there to fear regarding AI?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>AI will make us superhuman. Just as cars have made us superhuman (we can now &#8220;run&#8221; at 100mph), and phones have made us superhuman (we can now talk with people thousands of miles away), AI will give us superhuman memory, problem solving abilities, and an ability to get things done. 300 years ago, most of us worked in farming, doing the same physical task over and over again. Today, most of us work in offices, doing the same mental task over and over again. AI will do to boring repetitive mental work what the steam engine did to repetitive physical work in the fields.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How do you feel that AI can impact higher education? Will you see this in your lifetime?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At Udacity, we are already using AI and machine learning to maximize the chances of positive learning outcomes. We use AI to analyze individual students, helping our staff to time effective interventions. We use AI to analyze our content, finding any and every opportunity to improve the student learning experience. And of course, Udacity heavily teaches AI. Our students can get a nanodegree certificate in machine learning, or self-driving cars.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/sebastian.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-951818\" src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/sebastian-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"sebastian thrun\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/sebastian-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/sebastian-210x140.jpg 210w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/sebastian-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/sebastian-680x453.jpg 680w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/sebastian-968x645.jpg 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/sebastian-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/sebastian-205x137.jpg 205w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/sebastian-175x117.jpg 175w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/sebastian-38x25.jpg 38w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/sebastian-75x50.jpg 75w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/sebastian-320x213.jpg 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/sebastian-640x427.jpg 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/sebastian-804x536.jpg 804w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Sebastian Thrun is the CEO of Udacity, a former Google Fellow and VP, and a Research Professor at Stanford University.

However, thanks to the rise of software-defined technologies, those pundits may have actually been on to something. At least that is what the folks over at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.corsa.com\/\">Corsa Technology<\/a> are predicting.<\/p>\n<p>GigaOM recently had the chance to discuss the future of the switching and routing technology with Corsa\u2019s CTO, Yatish Kumar. Kumar explained that SDN (software defined networking) is at a place where it can readily replace traditional routing and switching devices. A statement backed by Corsa\u2019s VP of Product Management, Carolyn Raab.<\/p>\n<p>Raab said, \u201ctraditional switching and routing is fading, finally fulfilling the past predictions of industry pundits.\u201d Raab added, \u201chowever, the functionality of both will not fade away, but evolve instead, thanks to the adoption of better-virtualized solutions and software defined methods, which will improve deployments and access.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Raab said, \u201cHowever, to support the evolution of switching and routing technologies, service providers must embrace true network hardware virtualization, which is a must have to create virtual forwarding context (VFCs) at WAN scale.\u201d Raab is predicting that more and more service providers will leverage networking equipment that delivers WAN-scale open, programmable SDN capabilities. A prediction that makes a lot of sense, since service providers are looking to deliver innovative services, while giving their clients improved service level assurances.<\/p>\n<p>Capabilities enabled by the fact that SDN solutions are programmable and allow networking operators and their customers to spin up new services quickly and easily.<\/p>\n<p>Raab also noted that SDN virtualization will be used to accelerate on demand service. An observation backed by the deployment of SDN in service providers, internet exchanges, ISPs, and data centers. Raab said, \u201cWhat\u2019s consistent across all of them is they avoided delays caused by the often difficult integration of SDN orchestration, control and data plane elements. By moving past this integration roadblock, service providers have accelerated the ability to ramp up on-demand services that provide greater control and orchestration.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>However, Raab warned, \u201cIt is important to be aware of the security risks inherent in open programmable networks, such as those the in the world of SDN.\u201d Raab said, \u201cBut with the right approach and tools SDN done right can translate into two important developments:\u00a0 value-added security-by-design in the SDN implementation itself and by offering added policy-based secure traffic passage.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Raab predicted that more companies will look to SDN and NFV solutions that provide automated, policy-aware security in the control\/data plane and alleviate the perceived security holes due to open virtualized networks.<\/p>\n<p>Much of the new security capabilities and accelerated adoption of SDN and NFV solutions can be attributed to the preponderance of Open Source, which proves to be the right approach to SDN. Raab said \u201cas service providers and ISPs increasingly look for greater efficiency in delivering new services to customers, they will turn to the solutions that provide closer to 80 percent of the capabilities needed to control the data plane via open source or vendor supplied code, thereby avoiding hiring a large team of programmers to build a learning bridge or router from scratch. Operators will only have to do 20 percent of the work to customize their networking solution with value-add features that make it their own.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Raab further predicts that service providers and ISPs will opt for SDN solutions that are more turn-key in providing control across the network and leave 20 percent for the provider\u2019s creative input.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Much of the new security capabilities and accelerated adoption of SDN and NFV solutions can be attributed to the preponderance of Open Source<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8020068,"featured_media":632070,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[1865555,359215917,200565455,271299],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951815"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8020068"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=951815"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951815\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/632070"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=951815"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=951815"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=951815"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":951807,"date":"2016-12-16T12:47:57","date_gmt":"2016-12-16T18:47:57","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=951807"},"modified":"2017-01-31T10:06:09","modified_gmt":"2017-01-31T16:06:09","slug":"gigaom-launches-gain-ai-startup-challenge","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/12\/16\/gigaom-launches-gain-ai-startup-challenge\/","title":{"rendered":"Gigaom Launches &#8220;GAIN&#8221; AI Startup Challenge"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Gigaom will be holding our first annual competition for the AI start-up that delivers the highest ROI to corporate customers.

RAID makes no sense at all (whether it&#8217;s single, dual or even triple parity!), losing a 14TB disk could easily become a nightmare with very long rebuilds, impacting the performance the whole time (and without taking into account that triple parity RAID sucks performance wise). <\/p>\n<p>Distributed RAID mechanisms or, better yet, erasure coding, could be a solution. Blocks are distributed on a very large number of disks and thanks to an N:N rebuilding mechanism the impact is limited\u2026 but how many disks can you fit in a single system? (For example, IIRC an HPE 3PAR 28000 can have 1920 disks max, but I&#8217;m pretty sure this number could be halved for 3.5&#8243; drives\u2026 and I&#8217;m not too sure you&#8217;d buy such a powerful, expensive, array just for the capacity!).<\/p>\n<h2>Go Scale-out then!<\/h2>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/servers-300x169.jpeg\" alt=\"Computer rack servers\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-951787\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/servers-300x169.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/servers-768x432.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/servers-680x383.jpeg 680w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/servers-968x545.jpeg 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/servers-210x118.jpeg 210w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/servers-1500x844.jpeg 1500w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/servers-44x25.jpeg 44w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/servers-89x50.jpeg 89w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/servers-320x180.jpeg 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/servers-640x360.jpeg 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/servers-804x452.jpeg 804w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/servers.jpeg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>Let&#8217;s think scale-out then. Easier and cheaper right? Well&#8230; maybe!<\/p>\n<p>Since you can&#8217;t think of 12\/14TB HDD as a performance device, the lowest $\/GB is highly likely what you are aiming for. And how many disks can you fit in a modern storage server? Between 60 and 90 depending on a few design compromises you have to withstand. But hey! We&#8217;re talking about something between 840 and 1260TB in 4U, this is absolutely huge!<\/p>\n<p>Huge, in this case, is also a synonym of issues. You solve the problem of the single disk fail, but what happens if one of these servers stops? That could easily become a major nightmare! In fact, this solution is unfeasible for small clusters, and in this case small refers only to the number of nodes and not to capacity. 10 nodes, 1 rack, equals to 12PB of storage. It&#8217;s raw storage, but even if we take into account a 40% capacity loss for data protection, we are still in the range of 8+ PB! Losing a node in this scenario means 1\/10th of 8PB, 800TB!!! Think about rebuilding data, metadata and hash tables for all of that?  What will it take to get your cluster back at full speed? Well, it is true that some storage systems are more clever than others and can rebuild quickly, but it&#8217;s still a massive job to do\u2026<\/p>\n<p>A simple workaround exists of course, but it doesn&#8217;t make any sense from the $\/GB perspective. Putting fewer disks on more nodes is easy but it simply means more CPUs, servers, data center footprint and power\u2026 hence a higher $\/GB.<\/p>\n<h2>Making nonsense work<\/h2>\n<p>Even by taking the ability to scale for granted (and I know it&#8217;s not always the case), a larger number of nodes introduces a lot of issues and higher costs. More of everything: servers, cables, network equipment, time and so on. In one word, complexity. And, again, not all the scale-out storage systems are easy to manage, with easy-to-use GUIs, etc.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/IMG_20161209_180203-300x187.jpg\" alt=\"img_20161209_180203\" width=\"300\" height=\"187\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-951788\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/IMG_20161209_180203-300x187.jpg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/IMG_20161209_180203-768x478.jpg 768w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/IMG_20161209_180203-680x423.jpg 680w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/IMG_20161209_180203-968x602.jpg 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/IMG_20161209_180203-210x131.jpg 210w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/IMG_20161209_180203-1500x933.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/IMG_20161209_180203-40x25.jpg 40w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/IMG_20161209_180203-80x50.jpg 80w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/IMG_20161209_180203-320x199.jpg 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/IMG_20161209_180203-640x398.jpg 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/IMG_20161209_180203-804x500.jpg 804w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/IMG_20161209_180203.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>I think that OpenIO, with its SLS, has found the right solution. Their box is particularly dense (96 3.5&#8243; HDDs or SSDs!!!) but the box is the less interesting piece of the solutions. In fact, density is just a (positive) consequence.<\/p>\n<p>You can think of SLS as a complete scale-out cluster-in-a-box. Each one of the 96 slots can host a nano-node, which is a very small card with the hard disk in the back and equipped with a dual-core ARM-v8 CPU, RAM, flash memory and two 2.5gb\/s Ethernet links. The front-end connector, very similar to what you usually find on a SAS drive, is plugged directly into the SLS chassis just as it is for a normal hard disk in a JBOD.<\/p>\n<p>All the 96&#215;2 Ethernet links are connected internally to two high speed 40gb\/S Ethernet switches. The switches have 6 actual ports that can be used for back-to-back expansion of the chassis or for external connectivity.<\/p>\n<p>Failure domain is one disk, which equals to one node. And hardware maintenance can become lazier than before: you can afford to break many disks before going into the datacenter and swapping all of them in a single (monthly?) operation. <\/p>\n<p>Not that this is a new idea.  I heard about this idea for the first time <a href=\"http:\/\/www.juku.it\/en\/object-storage-is-cool-isnt-it\/\" target=\"_blank\">years ago<\/a> and projects like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.seagate.com\/it\/it\/enterprise-storage\/hard-disk-drives\/kinetic-hdd\/\" target=\"_blank\">Kinetic<\/a> are going towards the same direction, not to mention that a <a href=\"http:\/\/ceph.com\/community\/500-osd-ceph-cluster\/\" target=\"_blank\">Ceph-based cluster<\/a> was built on ARM not so long ago. This one is just more polished and refinished. A product that makes a lot of sense nonetheless and has a lot of potential. And truth be told, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marvell.com\/embedded-processors\/armada-3700\/index.jsp\" target=\"_blank\">hardware components are designed by Marvell<\/a>. But, again, it&#8217;s still the software that does all the magic!!!<\/p>\n<p>OpenIO&#8217;s object storage platform, <a href=\"http:\/\/openio.io\/product\/product_storage.html\" target=\"_blank\">SDS<\/a>, has a very lightweight backend,  allowing it to run smoothly in a small ARM-based device. Even more so, SDS has some unique characteristics when it comes to load balancing and data placement making it scalable and perfectly suited for this kind of infrastructure. A nice web GUI and a lot of automation in cluster management are the other key components to get it right. They briefed me a couple of weeks ago and they were able to get a new 8TB nano-node up and running in less than a minute, without any intervention if not the disk swap! (and as far as I can see of their internal design, 12 or 14TB won&#8217;t change much this time).<\/p>\n<p>They claim 0.008\/GB\/Month (for a 96x8TB SLS4U96 box with a 3 year support contract) and I think it is incredibly low.<\/p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t get the chance to ask about performance figures, but the first customers have already received their SLS-4U96 and in January I&#8217;ll be able to meet one of them. I can&#8217;t wait!<\/p>\n<h2>Closing the circle<\/h2>\n<p>No matter what you think, HDDs or SSDs are going to have similar problems: large capacities are challenging. We are talking about 14TB HDDs now, but vendors are already talking about future 50 and 100TB SSDs, with 32TB size already available! They sound big today, but you&#8217;ll be storing more in the future\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Data is growing, and you have to think about putting it somewhere at the lowest cost. The problem is that you can trade durability, resiliency and availability for a lower $\/GB. Especially because you want it cheap, but not really really really really cold! We like it cold-ish or, better, warm-ish, and with the increase of use cases for object storage in the enterprise (backup repositories, storage consolidation,  collaboration, big data lakes and so on) you absolutely need something which can give the best $\/GB, but without too many compromises or risks.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I came across two interesting news items this week &#8211; OpenIO introducing a 96-HDD appliance for its object storage platform and Western&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":43891028,"featured_media":951785,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[237047],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951784"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/43891028"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=951784"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951784\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/951785"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=951784"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=951784"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=951784"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":951773,"date":"2016-12-14T12:46:22","date_gmt":"2016-12-14T18:46:22","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=951773"},"modified":"2017-01-03T17:15:05","modified_gmt":"2017-01-03T23:15:05","slug":"announcing-ai-workshop-in-san-francisco","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/12\/14\/announcing-ai-workshop-in-san-francisco\/","title":{"rendered":"Announcing AI Workshop in San Francisco"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>We are excited to announce that we are hosting a workshop called <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/ai\/#workshop\">&#8220;Using AI&#8221;<\/a><\/strong>, on February 14, the day before <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/ai\/\">Gigaom AI<\/a><\/strong> begins.<\/p>\n<p>As an executive, you are probably trying to make sense of all the possibilities with AI and dizzying array of competing platforms.

The biggest issue is that the public cloud may not offer the level of security and speed needed by organizations that are transforming their intellectual property into actionable data sets. \u00a0Simply put, there are enterprises that share a common problem, they cannot or will not send their proprietary data into a public cloud.<\/p>\n<p>Factors such as compliance, privacy, and speed to market have driven many organizations to attempt to build internal data lakes, instead of turning to the cloud. However, in many cases, <a href=\"http:\/\/readwrite.com\/2015\/02\/09\/big-data-failure-blame-corporate-culture\/\">data lakes become far too complex to manage and increasingly resource intensive<\/a>. Nowhere is that truer than in the burgeoning IoT market, where sensors and devices are providing constant streams of data.<\/p>\n<p>To get a better feel for the problems facing businesses adopting a data-centric approach, GigaOm spoke with the founders of<a href=\"http:\/\/www.igneous.io\/\"> Igneous<\/a> Systems, a company created to bring IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) capabilities to businesses seeking to eschew public clouds for their sensitive data streams.<\/p>\n<p>Kiran Bhageshpur and Steve Pao (Igneous\u2019 respective CEO and CMO) offered observations that the two trends are related in that the falling price of storage has been encouraging even greater desires to store and retain data, rather than to throw it away. That one-two punch of increased data generation growing faster than dropping storage costs translates to something that seems unthinkable; the expenditures for storing data in-house and in the public cloud are actually rising as a whole.<\/p>\n<p>Pao offered that the economic challenges of higher expenditures make some new storage ideologies possible, ones that combine the elasticity and ease of use offered by the cloud, paired with the locality, control and security offered by on-premises storage solutions. However, it takes more than just economic pressure to create a storage paradigm shift, and that is exactly where Igneous Systems comes into the picture.<\/p>\n<p>Bhageshpur said, \u201cOur customers had a common problem, one where they could not use the cloud, either because their data sizes are so large that the latency of the internet created problems, or their data was proprietary and a core part of their company IP.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Pao added, \u201cAnother issue is that much of this critical data is being curated by line of business functions and not by enterprise IT groups normally responsible for managing a complex IT infrastructure, creating a situation where data can easily be managed outside of enterprise policy controls \u00a0. Those problems have an even broader impact on other industries. For example, we are hearing that in the scientific computing segment, biologists, chemists, and physicists are struggling to deal with the large data sets generated by their equipment.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Those realizations drove the creation of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.igneous.io\/services\">Igneous Data Service<\/a>, which is akin to building an on-premises, private cloud that acts as a scalable content store for large unstructured data. Bhageshpur said, \u201cThe Igneous Data Service offers true cloud for local data and supports the S3 API, which is rapidly becoming the <em>de facto<\/em> standard for cloud-based object storage.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The advantages of adopting the S3 API are many, starting with the fact that many application developers are already familiar with developing applications for S3, and numerous applications are readily available.\u00a0 What\u2019s more, the Igneous Data Service offers much of the same experience as the public cloud, in that Igneous handles all monitoring, maintenance, software updates and troubleshooting of on-premises equipment, all for the price of an annual subscription, which is based on installed capacity. That creates a zero-touch experience, which is one of the major benefits a public cloud service may offer.<\/p>\n<p>From a technology perspective, Igneous Systems incorporated four key attributes into the Igneous Data Service which it considers as \u201cfirst principles\u201d to enable cost-effective deployment of an on-premises Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offering.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>On-premises data with cloud management. While the data always stays on the customer\u2019s networks.\u00a0 Igneous continually monitors, maintains and troubleshoots its fleet of inventory using automated, software-based cloud management techniques employed in today\u2019s hyperscale cloud environments.<\/li>\n<li>RatioPerfect\u2122 architecture. Behind the Igneous architecture is a nano-server design where each disk has its own dedicated CPU and Ethernet connection.\u00a0 This design enables a highly-distributed architecture that provides the scalability and resiliency of the public cloud but scaled to run on a customer premises.<\/li>\n<li>Extensible Data Path. Large data sets typically require inline processing of data before uploads or downloads \u201ccomplete.\u201d\u00a0 With its extensible data path, higher level operations (such as auto-tagging for search) can be performed on a mirror of incoming and outgoing data streams without slowing down low-level system functions.<\/li>\n<li>Cloud native services. To enable new application workflows, the Igneous architecture is built utilizing a modern microservices approach and incorporates stream processing, an event-driven framework, and container services.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u201cWe started Igneous three years ago to deliver the type of distributed architectures enterprises need that will provide the public cloud with its scalability and resiliency,\u201d said Kiran Bhageshpur.\u00a0 \u201cWe see data as a rapidly growing asset base, and we look forward to helping our enterprise customers curate that data to speed decision making and support new business models.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One thing is certain; there is change in the air, fueled by the adoption of data-centric computing and enterprises need to think long and hard about their options, before drowning in a data lake.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The biggest issue is that the public cloud may not offer the level of security and speed needed by organizations that are transforming their intellectual property into actionable data sets.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8020068,"featured_media":646809,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[214084921,19471,359218029,359256659,359234705,359256660,359216381],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951775"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8020068"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=951775"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951775\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/646809"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=951775"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=951775"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=951775"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":951769,"date":"2016-12-13T10:01:07","date_gmt":"2016-12-13T16:01:07","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=951769"},"modified":"2016-12-13T10:01:07","modified_gmt":"2016-12-13T16:01:07","slug":"case-study-london-theatre-direct-tibco-mashery-and-the-power-of-the-api","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/12\/13\/case-study-london-theatre-direct-tibco-mashery-and-the-power-of-the-api\/","title":{"rendered":"Case Study: London Theatre Direct, Tibco Mashery and the power of the API"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>A recent meeting I had with the theatre ticketing company London Theatre Direct (LTD) was a timely reminder that not all organisations are operating at the bleeding, or even the leading edge of technology. That\u2019s not LTD itself, a customer of TIBCO Software\u2019s Mashery API management solution and therefore one already walking the walk. The theatres are a different story, however. Most still operate turnkey ticketing solutions of various flavours, making LTD\u2019s main challenge one of creating customised connectors for each.<\/p>\n<p>That work is now done, at least for London theatres, with the most obvious beneficiary being the theatre-going punter. \u201cCustomers could never find the tickets they wanted \u2014 they didn\u2019t have much choice and there was limited flexibility on price\u201d explains LTD\u2019s eCommerce head, Mark Bower. \u201cWith APIs in place, we can access millions of tickets. Every ticket is available, right up until show time.\u201d As a result, more tickets are being sold, to the equal delight of producers and venues. Jersey Boys saw a 600% uplift in sales when LTD was plugged in, for example.<\/p>\n<p>LTD haven\u2019t just created a more straight forward booking facility however. This is the API economy, in which everything is a platform \u2014 so third parties, such as hotels and transport companies, can also plug into LTD\u2019s service. These are early days but such tie-ups are inevitable. \u201c30% of people coming to London will want to go to the theatre,\u201d says Mark. \u201cWe can plug our service directly into in-room systems, avoiding the dark art of the concierge booking on a customer\u2019s behalf.\u201d And indeed, charging a premium to do so.<\/p>\n<p>So far so good, but LTD believe that something that could be seen as simply online ticketing is actually far more profound. A theatre production is at its core a creative act, with no guarantees of success at the outset. \u201cTheatre is not a one size fits all,\u201d says Anne Ewart, marketing director at LTD. \u201cYou can\u2019t walk into the ticketing industry and say, \u2018I want a show to do this,\u2019 that\u2019s not how it works.\u201d Rather, there needs to be a balance between the aspirations of the producer and the hard-nosed realities of getting punters in through the door and taking their money in return for their entertainment.<\/p>\n<p>The world of theatre is not very forgiving. \u201cVenue owners want bar sales and rent, and the minute the rent and incremental sales fall below a certain level, they are able to give a few weeks\u2019 notice to a show and they are out,\u201d says Mark. Such is the case for many celebrated and critically acclaimed productions. The ability, therefore to generate higher demand for tickets is of huge importance, as is reaching out to previously untapped demographics such as younger audiences who would tend to purchase the less accessible, cheaper tickets.<\/p>\n<p>Better ticketing doesn\u2019t just mean an uplift in sales therefore, it also means that producers and venues are able to put on shows that might previously be seen as higher-risk. This is all before even thinking about the nuggets of insight that will lie inside the ticketing data itself \u2014 who is going to what kind of show, when, using what form of transport and so on. As we discussed this, I was reminded of how farmers are taking soil samples so they know how to target fertilisers more accurately \u2014 I couldn\u2019t help wondering if the same principle applied to incentivisation of theatre goes to ensure all seats could be filled.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the takeaway is that the ticket itself is a consequence of past models, which worked as well as they could in the analogue world. Even as our interactions become more digital, we have an opportunity to make them more about the very human relationship between producer, customer and venue, all of whom are looking to gain from the deal. The opportunity exists to move beyond the blunt instrument of the paper ticket and towards deepened relationship, manifested for example as event-led packages, loyalty programmes or even patronage models.<\/p>\n<p>In the world of theatre and in many other sectors, technology enables us to move above and beyond the dark arts. Of course, the opportunity for abusing such tools also exists \u2014 there we face an ancient choice. But the stage is set (oh, yes) for a more direct, transparent relationships between participants. Cue applause.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A recent meeting I had with the theatre ticketing company London Theatre Direct (LTD) was a timely reminder that not all organisations&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87746169,"featured_media":951770,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[4276],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951769"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87746169"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=951769"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951769\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/951770"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=951769"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=951769"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=951769"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":951763,"date":"2016-12-12T17:30:33","date_gmt":"2016-12-12T23:30:33","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=951763"},"modified":"2016-12-12T17:30:33","modified_gmt":"2016-12-12T23:30:33","slug":"gurucul_pam","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/12\/12\/gurucul_pam\/","title":{"rendered":"Machine Learning Proves Key to Privileged Account Protection"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Behavioral analytics is quickly becoming the cornerstone of most every Infosec technology. However, it takes a lot more than simply analyzing user activity with rules and statistics, it takes applying ML (Machine Learning) to access and activity data, as well as employing AI (Artificial Intelligence) to reduce false positives and accurately risk score. Two critical capabilities that a multitude of security vendors have yet to address in their products to enable automated risk response. Those lacking machine-based cognitive abilities have come to rely on static pattern definitions, signatures and policies for a legacy world of known good and bad.\u00a0 Today, we must assume compromise and assess risk, even more importantly for privileged accounts with the access keys to IT environments.<\/p>\n<p>That said, some vendors have come to grasp the ideologies of applying the concepts of big data analytics to access and activity data to better judge the validity by risk scoring. An approach that leverages the latest in ML and AI capabilities, and requires the vendor to innovate and have a keen understanding of behavioral and predictive algorithms to deliver predictive security analytics to identify access risks and unknown threats. Nowhere is this truer than with controlling access to enterprise resources using privileged accounts and entitlements. Something that remains a potential hazard for businesses of any size leveraging cloud and on-premises IT resources.<\/p>\n<p>At 11\/29\/16 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gartner.com\/events\/na\/identity-access-management\">Gartner Identity &amp; Access Management Summit<\/a> held in Las Vegas, privileged account management proved to be a hot topic. Gartner revealed that \u201cIdentifying all systems and the corresponding privileged accounts is important, because every privileged account is a potential source of risk. However, this is a major challenge, as it is easy for privileged or default system accounts to be forgotten and left out. This is exacerbated by virtualization and hybrid environments that include cloud infrastructure. In such a dynamic environment, systems and accounts can easily fall through the cracks of privileged access management.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, Gartner is expressing that some better methodologies must be adopted to prevent potential breaches from occurring due to improperly audited and secured privileged accounts and entitlements, something that Infosec vendor<a href=\"http:\/\/www.gurucul.com\/\"> Gurucul<\/a> is keenly aware of.<\/p>\n<p>GigaOM had the opportunity to discuss privileged account concerns with Gurucul\u2019s CTO, Nilesh Dherange, who revealed that accounting for privileged accounts is only one of the security issues facing enterprises today. Dherange said \u201cAlthough many organizations are deploying privileged access management products to vault accounts with high risk entitlements, these tools may only perform discovery at the account level which creates blind spots for unknown privilege entitlements and exposes companies to unknown security risks.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Dherange makes a good point, it is those unknown security risks that prove to be the most troublesome for enterprises today, especially as systems become more complex and additional administration and application accounts are created, all with an increasing ability to \u201ctouch\u201d critical IT systems. What\u2019s more, many enterprises rely on spreadsheets or other notes to maintain an inventory of privileged accounts and those accounts are rarely audited.<\/p>\n<p>Dherange added \u201cIn a typical enterprise, the scope of privileged access discovery is manually unfeasible. For example, an organization with 10,000 identities each having 10 accounts with 10 entitlements would equal 1 million entitlements. This often results in rubber-stamping certifications and cloning user access rights. Overtime an entitlement may become privileged and remain hidden in these cycles.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Looking at that issue from a management perspective, it becomes clear that manually maintaining and auditing privileged account entitlements is far beyond the scope of most any organization. In other words, enterprises will have to rely on machine learning intelligence for risk-based approach to manage all of the moving parts involved.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOn average, Gurucul customers addressing privileged access risks have discovered that more than 50% of privileged access, including application privileges, are unknown to them and exist outside privileged access lists and vaults,\u201d added Dherange.<\/p>\n<p>According to Dherange, Gurucul takes a different approach to privileged access intelligence on large enterprise networks. \u201cGurucul is applying identity analytics and machine learning to discover privileged access that poses a security risk to the organization so that undocumented and unnecessary permissions can be eliminated or identified for monitoring with behavior analytics,\u201d claimed Dherange.<\/p>\n<p>Gurucul demonstrated its Access Analytics Platform (AAP) and Gurucul Risk Analytics (GRA) with privileged access discovery capabilities at the Gartner Identity &amp; Access Management Summit, showing that it has added new capabilities to its Access Analytics Platform (AAP) and Gurucul Risk Analytics (GRA) that eliminate blind spots associated with privileged access.<\/p>\n<p>Gurucul also announced the closed loop integration of identity and access management (IAM) solutions into AAP, which forwards accounts and entitlements with high access risk scores to IAM solutions for owner\/manager certification.\u00a0 Dherange said \u201cWhen an account and or entitlement is revoked, the IAM system sends an update to Gurucul which removes the risk and re-scores the machine-learning models.\u00a0 Several of our customers have implemented Closed Loop IAM integration using Gurucul with Oracle Identity Manager (OIM) to automate the detection and remediation of access outlier risks.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>With Gartner claiming that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gartner.com\/binaries\/content\/assets\/events\/keywords\/identity-access-management\/iam11\/evtm_89652_iam2016_top5topics_r1d.pdf\">\u201cPrivileged access is increasingly recognized as one of the most significant risks that organizations are facing, driving them to pivot from compliance-based to risk-aware strategies.\u201d<\/a> It is becoming very clear that enterprises today will need to turn to ML and AI based technologies, backed by the context of big data, to truly get a handle on what may quickly become one of the top security issues facing enterprises.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It takes a lot more than simply analyzing user activity with rules and

In anticipation of that, I caught up with him to ask a few questions.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>Byron Reese: Do you remember when you first heard about AI or when you first got interested in it?<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p><strong>Jerry Kaplan:<\/strong> The first time I heard about artificial intelligence was in 1968 when I saw the movie &#8220;2001: A Space Odyssey.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p><strong>And it was HAL that got your mind thinking. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s right.<\/p>\n<p><strong>When did you start writing about artificial intelligence? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, I went into the field, so I am not sure that counts. That was thirty-something odd years ago. Most recently I started writing about the field for general audiences, I should say, as opposed to technical papers, probably about four years ago.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And how would you describe the state of the art? Where are we in this great arc of artificial intelligence development? How would you sum it up?<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a very good question. I think there is a myth that we are on an arc, which is to say that we are somehow building increasingly intelligent machines that are ever-more general and are making their way up some kind of hypothetical ladder of intelligence towards human intelligence, and that is really not the case. Artificial intelligence is a collection of tools and techniques for solving certain classes of problems, and for a variety of reasons, as with other areas of computer science, we are constantly expanding the class of problems and solving new and different types of problems using those techniques. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you believe that we are heading towards building an AGI?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I see no compelling evidence that we are on the path toward building machines that have what you correctly called &#8220;artificial general intelligence.&#8221; I think this is a wild extrapolation from the current state of the art and there is no real reason to believe that the current set of techniques are going to get us there. With that said, there is a great deal of value in the utility of the problems that are currently being solved by the current generation of AI technology and it will have a significant impact in improving our lives and increasing automation and affecting people&#8217;s employment and raising a lot of interesting issues for what kinds of ethical and social controls we want to put on the deployment of this technology. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Well, that&#8217;s interesting. So if someone posed to you the question that Alan Turing posed to himself, which is &#8220;Can a machine think?&#8221; What would you say to that?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In the human sense, I would say no. I encourage you to read the original paper by Turing entitled &#8220;Computing Machinery and Intelligence&#8221;, because it is really interesting,. It&#8217;s not a technical paper. It was mostly him just speculating a little bit about a couple of far-out ideas. It is very readable, and it is quite interesting to see his point of view and his analysis on this particular subject, but what he said is, &#8220;I regard the question that can machines think to be too meaningless to deserve serious discussion.&#8221; That is actually what he said in the paper. He goes on to say, &#8220;However, I believe that in fifty years time we will be comfortable using words like &#8216;thinking&#8217; or &#8216;intelligence&#8217; as applied to machines.&#8221; So what he was talking about was the use of language, and interestingly enough, he was very close to being correct. He proposed a Turing test and he said, &#8220;I believe that when machines can pass this Turing test, that is when people will be willing to use this kind of terminology to describe them,&#8221; but he was not saying that the machines were intelligent. He was really just talking about the way that we would describe the devices that we were creating. <\/p>\n<p><strong>But doesn&#8217;t he go on in the same paper to say to the effect that we are going to have to broaden our understanding of what the word thinking even means because a computer may do something radically different than the way we do it, but we still in all fairness should say that it is thinking. Would you agree with that?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, we are violently agreeing, I think. You said he was expanding the use of the term. That&#8217;s exactly right. He was not saying that it would mean in fifty years that machines would have achieved human-level intelligence. He just meant that we would expand the use of the term, and that is true. Historically, there are many examples of this type of expansion of the use of language. It is perfectly normal. The most interesting one that I have run across is the expansion of what music means. Before the invention of the phonograph, like Thomas Edison, people believed that music was meant something that a person created and played, like an instrument. That was making music. When the phonograph came around, that was considered an odd curiosity, but many people did not consider it to be music. It was something new and different, and obviously over time, you and I talk about listening to music and it seems almost silly to say that is not music, but that is another example of the same kind of expansion of the use of the term. The thing that I think we need to be careful not to confuse is to think that those people back then were wrong or that they didn&#8217;t mean something by what they said than is different by what we mean by it. The general public today, particularly on this issue of, &#8220;Can machines think,&#8221; believe that what Turing predicted was that machines would be thinking in a human sense and that when they passed the test, they were intelligent. That is really not at all what he was saying. Just what you said is exactly correct. He thought it was a corollary or similar kind of behavior or activity that machines are engaged in and we probably just expand the use of the term because it was the closest description for those ideas that would be at hand at the time, and I think that is true. <\/p>\n<p><strong>You wrote a very well-received book called &#8220;Humans Need Not Apply.&#8221; What was your thesis in that book? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My basic reason for writing that book is that the advances in artificial intelligence are going to create certain kinds of social problems or make them worse, and at least when I wrote the book, nobody was talking about those social problems. Today they definitely are, and I wanted to point out that AI was a force that would make these particular social problems worse and that we needed to think about policy issues and social issues to address those concerns at the timeThe two issues are technological unemployment and income inequality. So I explained what artificial intelligence was and I argued at length that the effects of that technology would be to make these two problems worse and that we needed to have more thoughtful policy approaches in how to address them. <\/p>\n<p><strong>So Keynes is the one who came up with the term &#8220;technological unemployment,&#8221; and for the most part, we have had growing economic growth in the west and full employment for two hundred years. So to argue that there is going to be some kind of change in that, you would have to make the case that somehow this time it&#8217;s different. Do you agree with that, and if so, what is different this time around?<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p>I think that ever since writing that book that I have come around much more to the position that you mentioned. I think AI is a force in that direction, but when you look at all the forces and sum them up, what we are seeing is a continuation of a process that has gone on continuously since the start of the industrial revolution. Perhaps it will accelerate somewhat by virtue of new technology and artificial intelligence in particular, but the dominant forces suggest that it is probably not going to be the kind of labor apocalypse that some people think about or write about. The threats are that  fifty percent of all human jobs might go away in the next thirty years, pick your number. It sounds terrible until you really understand the way labor markets work and realize that it is probably true that fifty percent of the work they did thirty or forty years ago has gone away, or at least some significant percentage. What happens is that we automate certain tasks and that either makes some people more productive or that puts other people out of work in given professions. In some professions, it puts a large number of people or almost everybody out of work, but the result is usually due to elastic demand for products and services, a significant increase in demands for those products and services that either compensates in that industry or more often compensates in other industries. To put that more plainly, people have got more money to spend, and so what they do is they buy things and that increases employment in other areas. So what is likely to happen in the future are two things. One is that as these automation technologies come into use, we are going to see an increase in demand for other kinds of products and services that will employ other people in other industries. So you are going to see increases in employment in certain areas as a result, and in addition, we are going to see new kinds of professions come up that didn&#8217;t exist previously, and those will employ people as well. When you layer that on top of basic demographic trends in the workforce, at least here in the United States, it is unlikely that we are going to have a very big problem. Now, with all of that said, there are some people who are going to lose their jobs. This is a lot of what drove the recent election. People that are under-employed or are not as well-off as their parents, and we need to have good means for supporting them while they are retrained or otherwise retire them in some fashion from the labor force.  <\/p>\n<p><strong>Is your prognosis for the next twenty years in the United States we will see falling wages and rising unemployment or the opposite, full employment at good wages?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The next twenty years in the United States? The problem is going to keep shifting. When I wrote the book that you mentioned, &#8220;Humans Need Not Apply,&#8221; unemployment was very high, it was a big problem in the United States, and it wasn&#8217;t budging, even though the economy was moving ahead. So there was a lot of blame on technology, which I think was logically the case. Today, I think by all reasonable measures that we have full employment. Now, the skills of the work force don&#8217;t necessarily match well with the jobs that are available. A lot of jobs are going begging and a lot of people can&#8217;t get jobs or they are under-employed, meaning it is driving down wages. The answer to your question is really going to be answered by our public policies for economics and growth and all of that, so it is very hard to project this. I would have given you one answer two weeks ago and a different answer today because of the election. Whether or not we will see falling wages and unemployment or rising wages and more employment is more a function of government economic policy than it is anything to do with artificial intelligence or technology. <\/p>\n<p><strong>What would you say is the belief that you have about AI that is the most controversial or the most uncommon?<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p>One that is most surprising is I believe there is a very large disconnect or gulf between the public perception of what artificial intelligence is and what it means and the reality that is occurring actually inside the field. To put that in a quick summary, AI has a big PR problem, and this is potentially going to cause trouble and we need to do something about it, but there is nobody on point to try and recognize and fix this particular problem. So it is a bit of a replay of the tragedy of the commons. Everybody wants attention and accolades to their work, and the way you get that is by reinforcing and supporting a lot of wacky and crazy ideas, that we are summoning the beast and we are building these machines that are somehow going to reach human level intelligence, look at us eye to eye, and then maybe decide they are going to kill us. That is the public perception, and it is difficult for me to exaggerate how universal I find this opinion. I just did an AMA (ask me anything) on Reddit and that\u2019s mostly what you get questions about. That is the universal view, and it is being driven by a series of forces in the press and the entertainment media and pundits who benefit from promoting this ridiculous proposition, and it is simply not the case. So the evidence for it is negligible at best and I think it is misleading people. People are concerned about ethics of self-driving cars and maybe we should put controls on these developments before they somehow come alive and take over. I mean, this is all misguided. It is sucking the oxygen out of the real discussions we should have, which is what you and I were just talking about. How does this affect labor? How does this affect unemployment? What does it mean for income inequality? We haven&#8217;t talked about that, but I think that is a real factor. Those are the things that are going to make a difference in our lives. The rest of it are just flights of fancy. <\/p>\n<p><strong>I would say the reason people are concerned is that you have incredibly smart people, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Stephen Hawking, giving dire, catastrophic warnings. I mean, you paraphrased Musk when he was talking about summoning the demon.<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p>Well, therein lies the problem. Let me give you the real truth. These are very smart guys, there is no question about it. But none of them are experts in this field, and like the whole fake news problem that you are probably very well aware of, they are repeating, I assume with good intentions, the questionable warnings that they are reading about and seeing from other people. So they don&#8217;t have any direct involvement in this or any significant deep understanding of the technology. They are just pointing out and are reflecting things that other people have said. The problem is that like the fake news, these statements get far, far more attention than they deserve, so it just reinforces the idea and how could they possibly be wrong? We have this idea in our culture, of course, that anybody who is really rich or really famous doesn&#8217;t make mistakes. Well, I am sorry, but this is an idea that does not stand up to scrutiny any more than the idea that global warming is a hoax perpetrated by China. So I respect all three of the gentleman that you mentioned, but in this case, I respectfully disagree. Now, if you spend time with workers in the field, or go to a university and you ask this question, &#8220;Do you think these things are correct,&#8221; it is really surprising. You can walk from office to office through the artificial intelligence lab at Stanford and ask this question and you will get almost universally the following answer: &#8220;Well, I read that stuff. I don&#8217;t see how it relates to what I am doing. Personally, I don&#8217;t see it, but they are smart guys. Maybe they know something I don&#8217;t.&#8221; So I think this is a question within the field of the silent majority thinking that this is nonsense or at least there is no real concern or genuine support for it.  <\/p>\n<p>I have watched this movie for thirty years. That&#8217;s why I feel pretty confident in expressing some of these opinions. I have seen two previous waves of AI technology where it was exactly the same pattern. You had a couple of widely-quoted prominent people making over-reaching claims for what was going on in the field and what would happen based upon the dominant technology of the day, and none of it came to pass, and in fact, the technology today is significantly different. The approaches that the people thought would be the basis of generally intelligent machines has largely been discredited. So we have got the same words, &#8220;artificial intelligence,&#8221; for a whole bunch of different technologies. So right there on the face of it the idea that we are making progress is silly. The basic problem, and you are probably well aware of this, is people overgeneralize from a series of what are very different examples. So every time you read the press, &#8220;God, now a machine can do this. Now a machine can do that.&#8221; The analogy in people&#8217;s minds is that this is like a child growing up. Now he learned to ride a bike. Now he can eat with a spoon. Now he can do this, but it is not the same technology that is being used to solve all of those different problems. It is a little bit like drawing the conclusion that we are going to have a home kitchen robot that can do anything from the fact that I have got a toaster and an oven and a microwave and refrigerator. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh my God, what will technology do next and conjuring up Rosie the robot?&#8221; It is just not the case. So that is the main point that I try to communicate is that we have to try to sober up about this. There is real value in what is going on, but it is not that we are making ever-more general versions of the programs that we had five or ten or twenty years ago. That is not at all what is happening on a technological level. <\/p>\n<p><strong>So talk to me about social issues for a minute. We have had a period over the last sixteen years since 2000 of stagnant wages and rising corporate profits. Certainly the distribution of the financial benefits from technology have been accrued primarily to the wealthy. What do you believe are the mechanisms that bring that about? Why does that happen?<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p>Well, I will give you a theory that I think is possibly pretty strong, and I do cover this in both of my books. Automation is the substitution of capital for labor. So Karl Marx was fundamentally correct when he said that in the struggle between capital and labor, capital has got the upper hand, ultimately. So the people with the money are the ones that can afford to build the automation. Therefore, they are the ones who will gain the benefits of that automation. So the rich get richer and everybody else gets left behind. I see this in detail in my own life all the time. That is why it is just not some kind of philosophical or theoretical thing. I mean, I can point to stuff that goes on in my own life and why it is that the people that I deal with and you deal with continue to get wealthy while &#8220;disrupting industries,&#8221; which basically means putting people out of work. Now, there is nothing inherently wrong with that if it is layered within a system that distributes the benefits more widely. That is just not what we have got, so I really get worried. Let me give you a very current example of this. Everybody agrees that our country needs to invest in infrastructure. We have got decaying infrastructure, and we need new infrastructure, and we have starved it for a couple of decades. Alright, that is in the past. We do need to fix it. Everybody on both sides of the proverbial aisle agrees that needs to happen. Now, the latest proposal that I have seen, and this is just of course people floating stuff in the paper is that they want to privatize this. The idea is to privatize it and get people to actually get tax breaks for improving it. Now, that sounds good to an committed capitalist, but it doesn&#8217;t actually solve the problem for two reasons. A lot of the infrastructure that we need to invest in does not have a return on capital, so nobody is going to bother to take up that challenge. It has much more distributed benefits that are real and economic, but there is no way to capture the return on that in terms of a specific return on capital. The second thing is that the infrastructure winds up being owned by private interests, and that is a bad thing because we lose control over it and it won&#8217;t necessarily be managed in a way that benefits society or can be used by everybody to help spread equal opportunity and improve their lives. <\/p>\n<p><strong>What would you suggest for a policy remedy? You are using aspirational statements like share better and improve instructional, but how do you think we should do it?<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t want to pretend that I know the one true answer. I don&#8217;t, and I could easily be wrong, but I do study these issues, and I expect that you do, too. There is a difference between fact and fiction, practical policies and a bunch of abstract theory, and there are two basic problems that I see. We don&#8217;t make a distinction or public discussion between government investment and government spending, but  there is a very big difference between those two things just as there is in your personal life. A bigger budget doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that the government is giving away money on current consumption. It may mean that we are doing things which have significant economic benefits in the future. So the first thing is that we need to get that into the national conversation. It is perfectly reasonable for the government to run major deficits and to spend and to borrow to build infrastructure, as long as we are doing it hopefully in a reasonably smart way. Now, the second thing is that today interest rates are near zero. It makes no sense not to borrow. We should be borrowing hand over fist and running up the deficit precisely because the problem isn&#8217;t the deficit, the problem is the cost of servicing that deficit, and that is also missing from the public discussion. We shouldn&#8217;t be looking at how much money the country owes. We should be looking at what is the cost to service our debt and how is that likely to change in the future? So there are sensible policies that can be put in place, which will really have positive benefits for society. Everybody agrees on what we want to do, there just is not a sensible public discussion about the techniques for doing that. <\/p>\n<p><strong>So tell us about the new book. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My new book is potentially relevant to a wide swath of your audience. It is called &#8220;Artificial Intelligence: What Everyone Needs to Know.&#8221; It is part of a series from Oxford University Press called &#8220;What Everyone Needs to Know.&#8221; The book is a concise explanation of most of the questions and issues around artificial intelligence in a straightforward FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) format. So it is a set of questions and answers that people often ask about artificial intelligence. It covers the nature of the technology, the intellectual history of the field, what the ideas are and how they developed, a lot about current applications, and then covers many of the ways that AI will affect people in terms of labor, the economy, Etc. It also covers subjects such as how AI will affect legal theory and thinking and the administration of justice. Then I get into exploring many of the common myths that people  hear about, like, &#8220;Will I be able to upload my mind into a machine in the future?&#8221; &#8220;Is there going to be a singularity?&#8221; All the highly-visible issues that people tend to be concerned about are in the book. So if you want to get a brief, easy to read introduction to many or most of the key issues both technological and societal that surround the field of artificial intelligence. This is a quick and easy way to do it. You should be able to read the book in less than two hours. <\/p>\n<p>It is written for an intelligent reader. This is not dumbed down, but it is not technical and it requires no particular background. If you can read the New York Times or The Economist, you can read this book, and I hope that you will come away with a much better, and frankly, more sober understanding of the values and the risks associated with artificial intelligence technology.  <\/p>\n<p><strong>But I assume, when you say risks, you are optimistic about the technology. You are just concerned about peoples&#8217; irrational fears of it.<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p>Well, I think that irrational fears are overblown. However, there are real risks because the technology is so powerful that there are going to be areas where we are going to want to put controls in place that are very real in order to avoid some highly negative outcomes. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Such as?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, for example, artificial intelligence can enable new classes of very efficient killing machines for war, and just like the invention of chariots and machine guns and bombs dropped from airplanes, this may transform the nature of military conflict. Unfortunately, in ways that don&#8217;t necessarily advantage wealthy societies like the United States. ISIS might not have a nuclear weapon, but they may very well be able to build a machine that simply shoots every living thing in sight and pop that up in the middle of a shopping mall in such a way that it is extremely difficult to disable. Now, I am not talking about The Terminator. That is not the image I am talking about, but there is technology in your cell phone combined with some fairly straightforward robotics to operate and basically to shoot bullets that could devastate a public space, and organizations that today can not afford these kinds of destructive capabilities will be able to do so in ways that we really can&#8217;t foresee today. So that is an example of how AI technology may transform warfare. There are many others. <\/p>\n<p>We may need to place controls on when and how AI systems can act as an individual&#8217;s agent. Today, for example, if you ever try to buy tickets to a popular concert from a service like Ticketmaster, you may notice that the minute they go on sale everything is snapped up and you have got two seats up in the rafters when you are willing to hit the button as fast as you could and you wanted to get better seats. Well, the reason that is happening is not that there are thousands of other people buying tickets, but there are thousands of other robots buying tickets in many instances. If people could see that they were fighting against machines to get these tickets against robotic devices that are working on behalf of ticket scalpers, they would be up in arms and the entire practice would be outlawed. Now, as we move to a future of what I might call &#8220;flexible robotics,&#8221; this is going to be far more visible. If our sidewalks are crowded with little gadgets making deliveries so that you can&#8217;t safely walk or your self-driving car is parking itself and stealing parking spaces from cars that have people in them, these are significant social issues that are going to come to the forefront and are going to cause us to engage in various types of regulation or controls over the deployment and the use of this technology. <\/p>\n<p>The big challenge for artificial intelligence for the next few decades is how to ensure that the systems and machines that we build will integrate with human society and abide by the commonly accepted social conventions. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Join us at <a href=\"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/ai\/\">Gigaom AI<\/a> in San Francisco, February 15-16th where Jerry Kaplan will speak more on the subject of AI.<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jerry Kaplan is widely known as an Artificial Intelligence expert, technical innovator, serial entrepreneur, and bestselling author.

Most recently he has assumed leadership of Publicis.Sapient&#8217;s Artificial Intelligence Practice, helping companies leverage established and emerging artificial intelligence platforms to generate business insights, drive customer engagement, and accelerate business processes. With more than 22,000 people around the world, Publicis.Sapient, part of Publicis Groupe, is the world&#8217;s most advanced and largest digitally-centered platform focused exclusively on digital transformation and the dynamics of an always-on world. Some representative AI programs that Josh and Publicis.Sapient have been involved with include the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leveraging a semantic AI platform to generate unique customer insights for a global wealth management firm<\/li>\n<li>Creating next generation virtual assistants for a wide range of companies including leading theme parks, automotive firms, and retail banks<\/li>\n<li>Using machine learning tools to optimize media planning and buying activities for large CPG and airline companies<\/li>\n<li>Using a combination of AI technologies to build \u201csmart search\u201d tools for global energy and financial services firms<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>Byron Reese: When did you, when did artificial intelligence first appear on your radar? When do you recall being first intrigued or lit up by it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Josh Sutton:<\/strong> From a personal point of view, that would really go back to my early childhood. I think artificial intelligence has always been one of the things that I&#8217;ve been passionate about. As somebody that was always fascinated by technology and what you can do with it, subsequently going to school at MIT, it&#8217;s always been in the background of my thinking. But from a more recent point of view, coming out of the most recent AI winter when I really started to look at artificial intelligence, and when we as an organization started to realize that it might be time to start getting much more intelligent about what is and isn&#8217;t possible, was in the time frame of 3 or 4 years ago. <\/p>\n<p>At that point in time, I was running our capital markets business, and as you would expect some of the leading hedge funds in the world were dealing a lot with what today we would call &#8216;machine learning&#8217;. At that point in time, they were just calling it &#8216;very smart technologists doing very smart things to make a lot of money&#8217;. We were being asked more and more frequently, &#8220;What is actually going to be possible?&#8221; and &#8220;What are some of the technologies that are coming to the forefront?&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>Then as we really started to move forward, you had IBM making a big media splash with Watson winning Jeopardy. The momentum continued to pick up with the acquisition of Deep Mind by Google in 2014. All of these things started to pave the way for us to realize that we needed to get deadly serious about how this was going to impact the businesses we operate with and all of our clients, as well as our own business. So, we started looking at what are the different technologies out there. &#8216;Artificial Intelligence&#8217; is, unfortunately, a horrible term, but one that we seem to be stuck with. But, as you alluded to, it\u2019s a general catch-all for a wide range of different types of platforms, and often times if something becomes well understood, it ceases to be &#8216;Artificial Intelligence&#8217; and starts to be a different type of labeled technology.  <\/p>\n<p>Now, with that as a backdrop, what we&#8217;ve done within Publicis.Sapient is focus on two primary areas. One is looking at the technologies and tools that are available, and figuring out how we can deploy them to transform our own business, and be the absolute market leaders when it comes to the application of AI-related technologies to the field of advertising, marketing and communications. The second area that we&#8217;ve chosen to focus on is helping all of our clients on the consulting side understand how to put together an enterprise architecture that&#8217;s focused on AI, cognitive, whatever terms you choose to use, but really enables technology to drive insight generation, drive acceleration of business processes, drive business transformation through technology capabilities that weren&#8217;t possible 5 years ago \u2013 helping people understand what&#8217;s actually possible. Because this is a field where, even by the fairly generous standards of the technology industry, I think there&#8217;s been some fairly egregious discrepancies between what companies claim they can do and what they can actually do. So helping our partners really penetrate that myth of what&#8217;s real versus what&#8217;s hype, and how do I put that together to solve the business problems and challenges I\u2019m facing today? So, let me stop there, because that was a fairly long monologue.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where are you in your product life cycle?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, we&#8217;re not building products. We&#8217;re partnering with all of our clients, and putting together the right solutions for what we do internally. So, as it relates to that first part I talked about, around applying AI to our business, I think we&#8217;ve made some remarkably substantial strides in applying machine learning to the field of media planning and buying, and what we can do to really shift the entire focus of the media industry, from the segment level to an individual level. That sounds like a very simple thing, but it&#8217;s something that wasn&#8217;t possible to be done by humans, and wasn&#8217;t possible to react in the time frame, that you need a lot of time to really create the value that you want. So we&#8217;re able to generate returns for our clients right now that are extremely meaningful, saving them tens, and sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars, from advertising expense, by using these technologies. A lot of that is proprietary, how we&#8217;re using the different tools and applying them, and some of that is leveraging data that we&#8217;ve also put in place. From a partnership point of view, we partner with north of a hundred companies to aggregate different individual level data attributes on people that we are seeking to advertise and market to. So that&#8217;s been something that has been very fruitful for us, and continues to be. But we&#8217;re always on the lookout for companies that are building products that do it as well, because we&#8217;d much rather buy than built. That being said, I don&#8217;t think anyone&#8217;s put in nearly the focus on this particular space that we are. <\/p>\n<p>On the other front, which is what are we doing for our clients, there&#8217;s 3 or 4 main areas that clients are coming to us right now from a generalized use case point of view. The most common, as you would expect, is around the entire virtual assistant chatbot space, and we&#8217;ve been working with all of the technologies that claim to play in that space, which is growing literally by the day. I feel like there&#8217;s always somebody new that claims they&#8217;ve got the next best mousetrap. In general, what we&#8217;ve found is none of the core platforms on their own do everything that you would hope for. Especially given that people have expectations, in some cases, driven by the media, watching movies like &#8216;Her&#8217;, where you have a virtual assistant that sounds like a real person and acts like a real person. Now, we&#8217;re still away from that. But we&#8217;re making some real progress in being able to put different platforms together, and combining some of the virtual assistant frameworks and platforms with some of the more robust cognitive platforms, and some of the larger semantic players to produce some things that come close to that, if not there all the way, but a lot closer than what you see in production today. So, that&#8217;s been exciting for us and a lot of our clients that we&#8217;re working with.<\/p>\n<p>Another big area we focus on is, well, obviously, the targeted media that I&#8217;ve talked about, but also the automation of manual processes. This is an area that, strategically, we&#8217;re hoping a lot of companies look at, and people always go to cost cutting, as the reason you automate processes. What I&#8217;ve found consistently is that the companies that are really benefiting from these types of programs are those that are focusing on taking tasks that typically take an extended period of time, and reducing the time it takes to complete them, for a strategic advantage in the marketplace rather than just the cost saving component.  <\/p>\n<p>And the third area is around the extraction of insight from unstructured data. Now, IBM calls this &#8216;dark data&#8217;, but the problem that most companies deal with today is, 80% + of the data that you have access to is unstructured, and the amount of data is roughly doubling every year, so for companies to make intelligent, strategic decisions, leveraging the data they have access to, they need to figure out a way to systematically extract insight from that data, and that&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re really getting a lot of traction with. Particularly with some of the semantic platforms, which are a bit less well-known than the Google&#8217;s, Microsoft&#8217;s and Watson&#8217;s of the world. These technologies are often coming out of academia. <\/p>\n<p><strong>You say, with regard to your passing reference about the movie &#8216;Her&#8217;, you say we&#8217;re a little bit away from that. You mean literally we&#8217;re a little bit away, or do you mean we&#8217;re far away?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No, we&#8217;re a ways away from that. But I do think what we are doing, looking at how we can create virtual assistants that handle open-ended questions and conversations better than the frameworks today, is moving us in that direction. So it&#8217;s a baby step in that direction, but I don&#8217;t want to overstate it. It&#8217;s still a huge road between here and there. <\/p>\n<p><strong>And do you believe we can, do you believe we will build an AGI.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Absolutely, I absolutely believe we will build an AGI. I think it will be from a different framework than what we look at today. This might go down in the weeds a little bit, but if you look at all the major players right now, and by major players, I kind of group 6 of them together that are north of a billion dollar spend type of category, and that\u2019s Google, Microsoft, IBM, Amazon, Facebook and BaiDu, and while there&#8217;s lots of other players trying to move into that, I still think those are the big six.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Right. And you have people, just in these 6 companies, you have a range on when we&#8217;ll get an AGI, from 5 years in one case to 500 years in another case, within those companies. Why do you think there&#8217;s so little, why do you think there&#8217;s so much disparity on when people think we&#8217;re going to make it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s because everybody that&#8217;s close to the technology understands that where we&#8217;re going with machine learning, and I group machine learning as a very broad category that encompasses everything from your deep learning neural nets, through to your very basic algorithmic approaches, that is very good at enabling platforms to pattern match, and to learn based on experience. But what it doesn&#8217;t enable is the application of common sense and inference and reasoning about how the world works and the way you and I process information. So, that&#8217;s, to a certain degree, the dirty little secret of AI. There was actually an article in the Wall Street Journal a couple of weeks ago, where Yann LeCun from Facebook was quoted as highlighting the gap. Now the question becomes how do you fill that gap? Because if you proceed on the thesis that what the platforms today can do, and will be able to do in the not-too-distant future, is outperform humans, if they can&#8217;t already today, at learning from pattern recognition. To augment that, at a minimum you need the ability to apply common sense and a human construct of how we view the world to do that. So you cannot just learn from pattern recognition, but you can apply that to a framework, and extrapolate insight from that. That&#8217;s where you have a bunch of different people pursuing that over time, Ray Kurzweil has been a very vocal advocate that that&#8217;s where the entire singularity conversation happens. You&#8217;ve had people like Doug Lenat dedicate his life to it with Cyc and Cycorp, and what he&#8217;s been trying to build there. What Marvin Minsky was doing at MIT with ConceptNet is a big enabler of that, and a lot of those technologies. The Cyc&#8217;s and ConceptNet&#8217;s are not talked about as much, because they&#8217;ve been coming out of the academia and they aren&#8217;t as commercialized, they&#8217;re not robust at the same level as say TensorFlow or Deep Mind is, but directionally they&#8217;re moving in the right place to augment machine learning, and I say &#8216;augment&#8217;, not replace. But to augment machine learning with that common sense capability, and when you combine the two of those things together is when I think you&#8217;re going to see something that much more closely resembles AGI. Now, there&#8217;s lots of different schools of thought about how you do that and what the layer beneath that is, but frankly that goes way beyond my technical depth. But I think that&#8217;s why you have such a wide range of opinion about it. There are some people that philosophically just do not believe that what Minsky and Lenat and others have been doing will ever be successful. There&#8217;s other people that fundamentally believe that they are correct and the roads they are going down will yield results sooner rather than later. And then there&#8217;s a big chunk of people who say, &#8216;You know what? There&#8217;s a gap missing, and humans, by human nature, will learn how to fill that gap, but it&#8217;s going to take some time to do it, so we&#8217;re probably in the decades rather than years type of window.&#8217; <\/p>\n<p><strong>What is your take on the Chinese room problem, which argues that computers can&#8217;t really ever be truly intelligent? That since there&#8217;s nothing in the computer that &#8216;understands&#8217; anything, you can&#8217;t actually have an AGI. <em>[Note, this is a classic argument against the possibility of a general AI put forth by the philosopher John Searle. It is worth looking up in Wikipedia. But the basic idea is that because a computer is completely mechanistic, it simply follows programming. No matter how clever it looks, it doesn&#8217;t really understand anything.]<\/em><\/strong> <\/p>\n<p>That looks like a very philosophical argument, or debate, which is probably very germane to the book you&#8217;re writing, which is &#8216;Is the human mind a machine or not?&#8217; Do you process information according to a set of hard-wired objectives, guided by the rules that we learn, or is there something more than that? And I will not even attempt to answer that one on the record.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you think computers will ever attain consciousness?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Depends on how you define consciousness. If you mean, &#8216;Will they be able to interrogate themselves and question whether a hypothesis they put forward is correct or not, or is aligned with the objective they&#8217;re trying to achieve?&#8217; I believe the answer&#8217;s absolutely yes. Will they have emotion the same way that you or I have emotion? And relate to that? I think that gets into a realm of the &#8216;it&#8217;s possible, but unlikely&#8217;, because I think that&#8217;s something that, the concept of emotion would be to get into the human brain and look at is it a set of rules or not? I believe emotions are, to a certain degree, one of the hard-coded things that help steer us from a driver point of view, from a subconscious point of view. And that&#8217;s a way we process information and how our hardwiring works. But when you get into computers, will it mimic that? Very likely. Will it be the same as you and I? Difficult to say. I would lean toward &#8216;not&#8217;, but I would lean toward the action of what you would consider consciousness, of being self-aware as a possibility, yes. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you have an opinion on how quantum computing is going to lay into the creation of an AGI?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think what quantum computers are going to do is just dramatically increase the processing power. I believe that one of the challenges that you&#8217;re going to have, if you go down the road that we are today, which is a very machine learning-centric road, is incremental processing power is not going to give much more yield than what you have right now. Because you&#8217;re already constrained, to a large degree, by training data. And lots of people talk about having big data, but the reality is very few companies truly have big data at the scale that&#8217;s needed to drive machine learning, and get to the point of understanding that you and I operate within. Most of the technologies today require a large amount of data rather than small. When you start getting into the semantics and reasoning engines of some of the Minsky-esque type of philosophies, you start to reduce that, but not a lot of companies are going down that road yet. And although I think all of them in the background are, they just aren&#8217;t making a lot of noise about it. <\/p>\n<p><strong>So, you were very clear in your statement earlier, that the most successful practitioners of AI in your estimation are using it to do a process more efficiently, or speed up a process, as opposed to cutting costs. Do you think that on net, these technologies that we&#8217;re building right now produce jobs or destroy jobs, on net?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On net, I think it&#8217;s neutral. I think in a relatively short period of time you&#8217;ll see more job destruction than creation. Over an extended period of time, it will be a net neutral, and I base that on historical precedent. Every time we&#8217;ve had a major change in technology that&#8217;s changed the way society operates, we haven&#8217;t worked less, often times it&#8217;s back to work more, but we&#8217;ve been much more efficient and able to do more, and have a better quality of life resulting from it. I think this is no different than previous industrial revolutions, in that it will drive a higher quality of life. Over time it will drive the creation of new fields that, frankly, we can&#8217;t even fathom today, not having it as a part of the fabric of our society yet, but will seem intuitively obvious in twenty years. But the one thing that&#8217;s different is the rate of change that&#8217;s happening, it&#8217;s much faster than any other industrial revolution. So if you go back to Davos, the fourth industrial revolution construct, one of the big challenges with this one is that it&#8217;s happening in a period of years rather than decades or centuries. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Are you optimistic about the future?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Absolutely. I think, as a species we&#8217;re hardwired to continually try to improve ourselves, and improve our circumstances, and improve the environments within which we live. I think that, while there will obviously be exceptions to that, and always are, in how people use technology, we will use these technologies to improve our way of life. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Josh Sutton has been helping clients leverage advanced technologies to drive business transformation for the past twenty years.

We&#8217;ve already had a glimpse of it from Hyperconvergence, but this kind of infrastructure is trying to balance all the resources &#8211; at the expense of overall efficiency sometimes &#8211; and they are more compute-driven than data-driven. Data intensive workloads have different requirements and need different storage solutions.<\/p>\n<h2>The Rise of Flash<\/h2>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/Sign-flash-trash1-300x158.jpg\" alt=\"sign-flash-trash1\" width=\"300\" height=\"158\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-951756\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/Sign-flash-trash1-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/Sign-flash-trash1-768x406.jpg 768w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/Sign-flash-trash1-680x359.jpg 680w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/Sign-flash-trash1-968x511.jpg 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/Sign-flash-trash1-210x111.jpg 210w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/Sign-flash-trash1-1500x792.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/Sign-flash-trash1-47x25.jpg 47w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/Sign-flash-trash1-95x50.jpg 95w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/Sign-flash-trash1-320x169.jpg 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/Sign-flash-trash1-640x338.jpg 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/Sign-flash-trash1-804x425.jpg 804w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>All-flash systems are gaining in popularity, and are more efficient than hybrid and all-disk counterparts. Inline compression and deduplication, for example, are much more viable on a Flash based system than on others, making it easier to achieve better performance even from the smallest of configurations. This means doing more with less.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, All-flash allows for a better performance and lower latency and, even more important, the latter is much more consistent and predictable over time.<\/p>\n<p>With the introduction of NVMe and NVMeoF, protocols which are specifically designed to access flash media (attached to PCI bus) faster, latency will be even lower (in the order of hundreds of microseconds or less).<\/p>\n<h2>The Rise of Objects (and cloud, and scale-out)<\/h2>\n<p>At the same time, what I&#8217;ve always described as &#8220;Flash &amp; Trash&#8221; is actually happening. Enterprises are implementing large scale capacity-driven storage infrastructures to store all the secondary data. I&#8217;m quite fond of object storage, but there are several ways of tackling it and the common denominators are scale-out, software-defined and commodity hardware to get the best $\/GB.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes, your capacity tier could be the cloud (especially for smaller organizations with small amounts of inactive data to store) but the concept is the same, as are the benefits. At the moment the best $\/GB is still obtained by Hard Disks (or tapes) but with the rate of advancement in Flash manufacturing, before you know it we&#8217;ll be seeing the large SSDs replacing disks in these systems too.<\/p>\n<h2>The next step<\/h2>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/efficiency-300x200.jpeg\" alt=\"High Self Efficacy Level - Efficiency Objective\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-951088\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/efficiency-300x200.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/efficiency-210x140.jpeg 210w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/efficiency-768x513.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/efficiency-680x454.jpeg 680w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/efficiency-968x647.jpeg 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/efficiency-1500x1002.jpeg 1500w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/efficiency-205x137.jpeg 205w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/efficiency-175x117.jpeg 175w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/efficiency-37x25.jpeg 37w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/efficiency-75x50.jpeg 75w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/efficiency-320x214.jpeg 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/efficiency-640x427.jpeg 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/efficiency-804x537.jpeg 804w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>Traditional workloads are served well by this type of two-tier storage infrastructure but it&#8217;s not always enough.<\/p>\n<p>The concept of memory-class storage is surfacing more and more often in conversations with end users,  and also other CPU-driven techniques are taking the stage. Once again, the problem is getting results faster, before others if you want to improve your competitiveness.<\/p>\n<p>With new challenges coming from real-time analytics, IoT, deep learning and so on, even traditional organizations are looking at new forms of compute and storage. You can also see it from cloud providers. Many of them are tailoring specific services and hardware options (GPUs or FPGAs for example) to target new requirements.<\/p>\n<p>The number of options is growing pretty quickly in this segment and the most interesting ones are software-based. Take <a href=\"http:\/\/datacore.com\" target=\"_blank\">DataCore<\/a> and its Parallel I\/O technology as an example. By parallelizing the data path and taking advantage of multicore CPUs and RAM, it&#8217;s possible to achieve incredible storage performance without touching any other component of the server.<\/p>\n<p>This software uses available CPU cores and RAM as a cache to reorganize writes while avoiding any form of queuing to serve data faster. It radically changes the way you can design your storage infrastructure, with a complete decoupling of performance from capacity. And, because it is software, it can be installed also on cloud VMs.<\/p>\n<p>A persistent storage layer is still necessary, but will be inexpensive if based on the scale-out systems I&#8217;ve mentioned above.  Furthermore, even though software like DataCore&#8217;s Parallel I\/O can work with all existing software, modern applications are now designed relying on the fact that they could run on some sort of ephemeral storage, and when it comes to analytics we usually work with copies of data anyway.<\/p>\n<h2>Servers are storage<\/h2>\n<p>Software-defined scale-out storage usually means commodity X86 servers, for HCI is the same and very low latency solutions are heading towards a similar approach. Proprietary hardware can&#8217;t compete, it&#8217;s too expensive and evolves too slowly compared to the rest of the infrastructure. Yes, niches good for proprietary systems will remain for a long time but this is not where the market is going.<\/p>\n<p>Software is what makes the difference&#8230; everywhere now. Innovation and high performance at low cost, is what end users want. Solutions like DataCore do exactly that, making it possible to do more with less but also do much more, and quicker, with the same resources!<\/p>\n<h2>Closing the circle<\/h2>\n<p>Storage requirements are continuing to diversify and &#8220;one-size-fits-all&#8221; no longer works (I&#8217;ve been saying that for a long time now). Fortunately, commodity x86 servers, flash memory and software are helping to build tailored solutions for everyone at reasonable costs, making high performance infrastructures accessible to a vaster public.<\/p>\n<p>Most modern solutions are built out of servers. Storage, as we traditionally know it, is becoming less of a discrete component and more blended with the rest of the distributed infrastructures with software acting as the glue and making things happen. Examples can be found  everywhere &#8211; large object storage systems have started implementing &#8220;serverless&#8221; or analytics features for massive data sets, while CPU intensive and real-time applications can leverage CPU-data vicinity and internal parallelism through a storage layer which can be ephemeral at times&#8230; but screaming fast!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The traditional enterprise storage market is declining and there are several reasons why.

In anticipation of that, I caught up with him to ask a few questions.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>Byron Reese: How did you first come to get involved with AI? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Rob May:<\/strong> I was in college at the University of Kentucky and I had a Bachelor&#8217;s Degree in Electrical Engineering and I was working on my MBA. So I had to take a class for business school that was on information technology. This was 1998, probably, and taking that class, we had to write a paper about some important topics in IT and being an engineering major, I found the whole class pretty boring. So I was flipping through the textbook to look for something to write about and the very last chapter was on artificial intelligence and the future of IT. So I decided to make that my project and I read a lot at the time of AI and a lot about things like fuzzy logic. There was a guy who was a pretty prominent writer at the time called Bart Kosko, who wrote some cool stuff. Yeah, I just fell in love with it, in part because it wasn&#8217;t just a technological problem, but it was very cross-functional, multi-dimensional. I had to read a lot about linguistics, philosophy of mind, cognitive science, neuroscience, computer science, robotics, and electrical engineering. It was a really fascinating cross-discipline subject. <\/p>\n<p><strong>If you were to describe the state of the art right now, where are we in AI? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That is a complex question to answer, I think. I think you\u2019ve got two things, I think. We don&#8217;t have a good generalized anything yet. I think there are probably some technological breakthroughs that need to happen to get there. What we do have is we have a lot of very awesome specific types of intellectual agents and I think those are really impressive, so that is one side of it. On the second side though, a lot of even where we see the impressive work is still academic and research driven, so we\u2019re not very good yet at productionizing a lot of that into real software. I think you\u2019ll see\u2014there aren&#8217;t best practices around neural networks the way that there are around databases in terms of how you engineer them, how you scale them, how you break them up into pieces, how you diagnose their problems. A lot of the academic papers that come out are very difficult to replicate in a real production software environment. So I think in terms of solving general AI, we\u2019re pretty far away from that still, but we\u2019re on a good path. In terms of bringing intelligence into the real world we\u2019re further along, but that still lacks a lot of work on bridging the academic to the software engineering side. <\/p>\n<p><strong>So it seems that you think that AGI is kind of along an evolutionary path from where we are. That we basically know what we\u2019re doing and AGI is just going to come about with our existing techniques done better, stronger, and faster. Do you think that? Do you think AGI is just better AI than what we have now?<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p>When I say better, I don&#8217;t necessarily mean better in terms of we just need faster computers or bigger neural networks or anything like that. The way I would phrase it is I think AGI is going to be very hierarchical and I think that we have built the early building blocks for that and we need to understand the next levels of abstraction to be able to solve the problem. I do think that there are big technology leaps to make, but I feel pretty good that we\u2019ll make them. <\/p>\n<p><strong>When do you think we will see something like an AGI? The range of guesses among people who merit having a guess is between five and five hundred years. Where would you be in that span?<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p>I would be on the lower side of that. I don&#8217;t think a lot about when specifically it might happen, but my guess would be in twenty to twenty-five years because these things are accelerating. The way I would work through this problem in my own mind is I would say, well, if I was going to do a linear extrapolation of when we might get there, then yeah, I would probably say it is a hundred to two hundred years out, but it\u2019s an accelerating trend and so that is going to be compressed and build on itself, so that is why I would make a shorter guess. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Take things that we would normally think would be very hard for AGI, like creativity. Do you think that an AGI in twenty or thirty years\u2019 time could write a great novel?<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think it will even take that long. I think that is a specific-use case that will be solved before we have AGI, so I think there will be a lot of problems that seem difficult now that will be solved with artificial intelligence before we have a generalized artificial intelligence just because it will be a matter of having the right data sources and having some new breakthrough and creating algorithms that make it possible to attack that domain now. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Such as?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yeah, I would say some of the really interesting areas, some of the areas that might be challenging to solve I would say would be things like analogy-making across disciplines, right? So like how do you abstract and say, &#8220;Well look, I know this principle of complexity theory based on how ant colonies work and I am going to apply that to a social phenomenon of humans or I&#8217;m going to apply that to a computer program that I&#8217;m going to write.&#8221; How does somebody looking at biologists studying evolution understand and say, &#8220;Well, this is something we could use to evolve better computer programs and come up with genetic algorithms.&#8221; Those kinds of cross-domain analogy-making applications will be one of the last things to fall and I think that\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s really important in building an AGI. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you think that computers are going to become conscious?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I do. I think maybe not in my lifetime, but maybe in the next hundred years. I think we will be asking ourselves questions about whether or not machines have certain rights. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Stephen Hawking have all recently voiced concerns about AI. Elon Musk famously referred to it as summoning the devil. Are you afraid of an AGI?<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p>At this point, I am no more afraid than not afraid. I am pretty balanced because I don&#8217;t know that we have evidence of why we should be one way or the other. We really don&#8217;t understand human motivation very well, like at a biological and neurobiological level and I think we don&#8217;t understand yet how you would program motivation into an AGI.  People could argue, well, the AGI might change and reprogram its own motivations, but I don&#8217;t know, you get in all these second order problems. I mean, we humans don&#8217;t necessarily do that. Maybe we go to therapy and wish that we can change our motivation, but we can&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t know really have any more reason to think it will be negative than to think it will be positive and they might ignore us and not care about us. <\/p>\n<p><strong>One fear is that even if they don&#8217;t naturally become dangerous, but that bad actors in the world will program one.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Right, so that I am concerned about. In fact, I am a little bit concerned about what Elon Musk is doing there because when you look at Open AI, the whole premise behind Open AI is let&#8217;s share this with the world to make sure that it is not in the hands of big, elite companies who might use it nefariously. But here&#8217;s the thing \u2013 we don&#8217;t know what the breakthrough is going to be that is going to lead to generalized AI, right? It might be somewhere that some college kid in a dorm room in fifteen years has the last small step of insight that we need to do it. So what you are doing with Open AI is you are creating a scenario where now everybody has equal access, you are given the possibility that somebody bad or somebody nefarious might be the person that makes the final contribution, and they don&#8217;t have to share that last contribution, that last small step in what makes a generalized AI. I personally would feel much better if Larry Page or Mark Zuckerberg or Jeff Bezos was in charge of deciding what to do with the first generalized AI because these people have thought a lot about ethical issues running their own companies. Now, I&#8217;m not saying that I would always trust that they are doing the right thing, but what I am saying is they have had to think about legal issues and ethical issues as part of running big companies. They are more prepared to deal with this than a college kid somewhere. So by opening up access, I worry that Open AI risks causing the very problem it is trying to solve. Why is nobody saying, &#8220;Well, look, the way to solve the nuclear weapons problem is let&#8217;s really open up nuclear research so anybody can have access to it.&#8221; Well, yeah, that doesn&#8217;t make any sense. <\/p>\n<p><strong>How do you think AI is going to change business?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a great question. So, I think, in the first wave of investment that came in 2013 to 2015 in the latest version of AI technologies, I think people didn&#8217;t think a lot about underlying use cases, they just knew there was something here and they knew there was a small group of people who understood it, and so the main way to raise funding was based on your academic credentials. So you saw a lot of PhDs get funded, you saw a lot of people building broad AI platforms\u2014MetaMind, Clarifai, Indico, companies like that. Those are difficult places to start because you are building these platforms when the end-use cases aren&#8217;t well defined yet. Some companies have been really smart. I think Clarifai has done a good job of making their platform more targeted. Packaging it up into more product use cases and that is why they just raised another round of funding. So the way that I would phrase it now is now you&#8217;re starting to see the idea where a lot of smart technologists who may not understand the math behind the back propagation algorithm, but understand conceptually what some of the opportunities are in AI are moving into this. I have seen a lot of smart technologists start companies. <\/p>\n<p>Where the real explosion is going to happen is in another few years when much of the technical work to do AI gets packaged away and abstracted in a way that&#8217;s really easy. So people started with these platforms, and once there&#8217;s enough use cases, those platforms will make a comeback and they&#8217;ll be very useful and people will start to abstract that way. Then you&#8217;ll have the idea of any software engineer to be able to add AI to their platform and it will be pretty cool, but I think it is going to change businesses in a lot of ways. <\/p>\n<p>I think you are going to see a major economic boom driven by AI. The reason is that historically what has driven economic growth to this country is productivity growth. A lot of that productivity growth is driven by technology. The last wave of technology, the consumer wave and the cloud wave, the social stuff and the cloud stuff, the cloud stuff was mainly a cost rearrangement issue, right? It wasn&#8217;t like, wow, we&#8217;re so much more productive because our stuff runs in the cloud now than on premise. Maybe marginally, maybe a little bit, but it wasn&#8217;t a sort of step function in productivity. Then, the consumer stuff, the social stuff, was really made more efficient on the demand side. It fragmented our time. So hey, I watch less TV because I&#8217;m tweeting and I\u2019m streaming music and I am doing whatever at the same time. It made the demand side more efficient, and if you believe that demand drives a lot of economic growth, it&#8217;s part of the reason growth has been anemic. We didn&#8217;t have to buy tapes and CDs, we can just stream from the same song. We didn&#8217;t have to buy as many cars and hotels rooms because of Uber and AirBnB. So there have been a lot of those issues that\u2014I wouldn&#8217;t say they have been a drag on growth, but there has been an absence of drivers and productivity growth. What you&#8217;re going to see with AI is the initial augmentation of workers to make them much more productive and I think that\u2019s really going to lead to an explosion of productivity. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if three or four years from now we&#8217;re looking out and we\u2019re seeing a couple of years of three, four, five percent productivity gains again as people start to do more and more. <\/p>\n<p>The way it is going to impact businesses, first you&#8217;re going to have the ability to automate away tasks that are monotonous, mundane, simple. You&#8217;re going to see augmented information gathering, decision-making. You&#8217;re going to see computers supporting humans in the things that they do and then the computers are going to slowly inch their way up that stack of cognitive capability and take away more and more of the human work. I don&#8217;t know how long it takes to get that whole stack done, but when you&#8217;re eating the bottom part of that stack, the early phases, and you are augmenting the humans primarily, that&#8217;s going to be explosive. I think the growth is going to be fantastic. On the other side, maybe it comes around and hurts us in the long, long run, but it\u2019s unavoidable. <\/p>\n<p><strong>So you are an angel investor. What do you look for? What&#8217;s your investment thesis on AI?<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p>Yes, great question. So I&#8217;ve got about fifteen angel investments and ten of them are in the AI space, so that&#8217;s really where I&#8217;m mostly focused. I look for a couple of things. I look for general things like, I am very entrepreneur-focused, so is this entrepreneur hungry, is this the kind of person who can deal with a lot of setbacks and obstacles and get through it all and make things happen. So I look a lot at that. I look at long-term access to data sets. Data is very important in AI, the data sets you have. I don&#8217;t need a company to say they have the data sets they need on day one, I need them to have a creative way to get it, or to build it over time, so I look a lot at that. I look for applications of the technology that are going to stay out of the way of where Google and Facebook and Amazon and the big guys are going in the near term. Then I look at the upside of the market opportunity. I&#8217;m less concerned with downsized risk and whether I lose money and more concerned with the idea that, if I am right, can this be a really big company? So those are the factors that I evaluate, but I&#8217;m more agnostic about the specific underlying AI technology people use. I don&#8217;t have a strong bias for or against like deep learning versus phased in approaches or whatever. I think they&#8217;re all going to change a lot over the next five or six years as new techniques emerge. <\/p>\n<p><strong>So if you were to think through every industry, consumer industries as well as B2B stuff, where do you think the biggest gains, the best low-hanging fruit can be found? Is it going to be pure knowledge work or is it going to be logistics or is it going to be in things where you have customer service and you interact with other people? Where do you think is a great place where you think, &#8220;Oh, that\u2019s an area where we\u2019re going to see huge gains pretty quickly without a doubt.&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So, two things. I think anything robotics driven you&#8217;re really going to start to see an explosion there. Anything where a machine couldn&#8217;t do it because it needed some autonomy, it needed to be able to learn in its environment is now going to be open. So I do think a lot of logistics. I think a lot of the self-driving car stuff is going to have broad and deep implications even far beyond what we think right now. Then I think knowledge workers are going to be heavily impacted, but not on the part where they interact with consumers or interface with customers. I actually think that will be the last part to be automated away, and that will be a long time coming because if I think about the CEO, if I have a salesperson or a support person or somebody like that, I would rather automate away the other parts of their job and have them spend as much time as they can doing the face-to-face work that they&#8217;re good at rather than automate that piece away. So I think you&#8217;ll see that happen from the bottom up. I think you&#8217;ll see a lot of the reporting, a lot of the data collecting, a lot of the analytics and prediction and decision making and all that kind of stuff being taken over by the machines before the actual communications with customers and users is taken over by the machines. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Where do you think the United States is compared to other countries in terms of research and development and implementing and investments in AI and so forth?<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p>I think we&#8217;re probably still tops in the world if you think about it from an ownership of IT perspective. I say that because a lot of Google DeepMind group is run out of London, but they are owned by Google, and so if you want to look at it from an ownership perspective, I think we are pretty powerful. If you want to look at it from a data perspective, I think American companies have some of the best and most interesting data sets in the world, that are going to allow a lot of this training. I worry that in the next five or six years we could slip to number two behind China, because China is making a tremendous amount of investment in these fields, and possibly even Japan, who is investing a lot. In a while I think we will slip to Japan. I think that is going to reinforce what&#8217;s happening in Asia, and culturally they are very different in how they think about AI and robots and some of that stuff. They were earlier to mobile phones because they skipped a lot of the landline infrastructure. They didn&#8217;t have a lot of the legacy problems that we had to suffer through. Messaging was there earlier and I think it has driven the success of WeChat. So I think the United States is still in the lead. There is a chance we keep the lead, but who knows?<\/p>\n<p><strong>I guess all of your comments are absent regulatory hurdles that impede development.<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p>Yes, so that is a really big challenge, I think, for the United States. With this technology accelerating and taking over fast and the potential for misuse if North Korea or Iran or someplace that is despotic becomes a leader in AI, how do you regulate it appropriately in ways that keep things going well and keep things moving forward? Because in this country we&#8217;re very pro-regulation, maybe too much so, and I worry about a lot of this work moving overseas if we do regulate it too much, but I also worry about&#8230;you know, our politicians tending to be lawyers. They don&#8217;t come from science and technology backgrounds. They don&#8217;t understand this stuff and the scientists and the technologists, a lot of them don&#8217;t have any ethical or philosophical or political training to think about the impact of government and everything else. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Tell me about Technically Sentient. How did you happen to pick that name?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, because I thought that you have this idea that you&#8217;re going to build machines that are self-aware and it was sort of a word play on &#8220;technically,&#8221; meaning technical, computers, and all that kind of stuff. Then also meaning the definition of &#8220;Well, technically,&#8221; and that kind of thing. I looked at it as sort of a double entendre and sort of passing the Turing test.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And what are you trying to do with it?<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p>My last company was in the backup and security space and so I wanted to rebrand myself, so I started an AI company. I have a lot of AI experience in my past, but that&#8217;s not how I\u2019m known to the community and I saw a real absence of AI thought leadership on the business side and on the applied technology side. A lot of it was deep technology. So I decided, hey, if nobody&#8217;s out there, I like to write and I like to follow a lot of this stuff. I have strong opinions about everything. It partially was an opportunity to do three things, really. One, brand myself and be able to promote my company sometimes, when appropriate. I try not to do that too much. Number two, it&#8217;s a very scalable way to keep in touch with people. I mean, I have almost seven thousand subscribers. Some of them are my friends, some of them aren&#8217;t, but they hear from me every week. They feel like they know me. They feel like we&#8217;ve been in touch even if we haven&#8217;t, so that&#8217;s kind of good. The third is that it&#8217;s a great source of deal flow for angel investing because a lot of entrepreneurs read it, a lot of VPs read it and will often share deals with me or will ask me to come into a deal. So I get a lot of benefits from it and I feel like as long as I keep it curated at a high quality, then the viewers get a lot out of it as well. <\/p>\n<p><strong>You are the CEO of Talla. Tell us about that. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, so Talla started out in the chat bot space, and we are focused on building a chat bot for HR teams. What we found as we started going down that path is that a lot of the workflows that you might try to build into a bot actually need to be highly customizable. So we ended up extracting the platform to a higher level, so that the way you can think about it now is you just think about a bot as just another interface, like a mobile app or web app or anything like that. What you can really do with Talla is you can build and automate intelligent, communication-driven or data-driven workflows that are HR related. So let me give you some examples. So you can install Talla in Slack or HipChat or whatever communications system you use. Then you can use Talla to execute polls that look at employee net promoter scores. Talla can do on-boarding for your new employees. So on day one, Talla can drip in, &#8220;Hey, you should fill out these forms. You should read this article. You should do this thing.&#8221; &#8220;On day five, you should do this.&#8221; &#8220;On day seven, you should check in with your manager and talk about this.&#8221; You drip that in over time. You can give Talla commands like, &#8220;Hey, generate a letter for this person.&#8221; Talla will ask you a couple of questions and go off and do it, suggest pay ranges.

This issue has dogged me for some time, indeed every time I tried to make headway writing the now-complete book <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/smartshiftbook\/\">Smart Shift<\/a>, I was repeatedly beset by the world changing for a thousand reasons and in a thousand ways. (As a result, incidentally, the book has morphed into a history of technology that starts 200,000 years in the past \u2014 at least that isn\u2019t going to change! But I digress.)<\/p>\n<p>Even though making sense of the rapidly changing digital landscape feels like drinking from several fire hydrants at once, such immersion does reveal some pointers about where technology is going. Across conversations I had at Re:Invent, not just with the host but also Intel and Splunk, Treasure Data and several partners and customers, a number of repeated themes started to let themselves be known.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with hybrid and get it out of the way. Actually, let\u2019s start with the fact that AWS are pretty impressive in what they are achieving and how they are achieving it, with a strong focus on the customer and a business model that really does save organisations a small fortune in running costs. This being said, one aspect of the organisation\u2019s overall pitch stuck out as incongruous. \u201cWe were misunderstood. Of course we always believed hybrid models were valid,\u201d said Andy Jassy at the keynote. I paraphrase but that\u2019s roughly\u00a0it; it is also out of kilter with what has been said in previous years. I (and the\u00a0people I spoke to) have too good memories to take this revisiting of history with anything other than a pinch of salt.<\/p>\n<p>A second topic of conversation, notably with Kiyoto Tamura of data management platform <a href=\"https:\/\/www.treasuredata.com\">Treasure Data<\/a> but reinforced by several customers, was how multi-cloud models would pervade \u2014 again, despite AWS\u2019 opinion to the contrary. While it may be attractive to have a \u201csingle throat to choke\u201d and reduce the number of vendors accordingly, a clutch of reasons make two or more cloud providers better than one: many government organisations have a requirement to work with more than one supplier, for example; meanwhile past decisions, cost models, use of specific SaaS that drives deeper PaaS, all make for a multi-cloud situation alongside the hybrid consequence of using existing IT.<\/p>\n<p>Even as AWS toes the hybrid line (to its credit as this is a significant pillar of its alignment to the enterprise, a point I will expand upon in a future blog) and pushes back against the notion of multiple clouds, I think the world is already moving on from the history-driven realities of hybrid and the current inevitability of multi-cloud. The history of this technological age has been marked by some underlying tendencies, one of which is commoditisation through supply and demand (which directly leads to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jonno\/status\/791940953296613376\">@jonno\u2019s first law of data growth<\/a>, also the subject of a future blog) and the second, a corollary, is the nature of providers to expand into less commoditised areas.<\/p>\n<p>Case in point: AWS, which started in storage and virtual servers, but which is placing increasing attention on increasingly complex services \u2014 c.f. the machine leaning driven Alexa, Lex and Polly. To stay in the game and not be commoditised out of existence, all cloud providers inevitably need to become platform providers, purveyors of PaaS. As another corollary, this does send a warning shot across the bows of platform-enabled facade companies, such as those over-valued digital darlings AirBnB, Uber and the like. Who are quite rightly diversifying before they are, also inevitably, subsumed back into the platform.<\/p>\n<p>The future is platform-based rather than cloud-based, for sure. As Andy Jassy also said, and again I paraphrase, \u201cWe don\u2019t have to waste time having those conversations about whether cloud is a good idea any more. We can just get on with delivering it.\u201d The conversations are already moving on from cloud and towards what it enables, and it will be enabling far more in the future than in the past. As yet another aside, it may be that AWS should be thinking about changing its mantra from \u201cjourney to the cloud\u201d to \u201cjourney to what is enabled\u2026 but I digress again.<\/p>\n<p>The platform perspective also deals with how we should think about all that pesky in-house, legacy stuff. There\u2019s barrow-loads of it, and it is fantastically complex \u2014 we\u2019ve all seen those technology architecture overviews that look something like a Peter Jackson-directed fly-through of an Orc-riddled mine. For many enterprise organisations, such complex, arcane and inefficient environments represent their business. But, fantastically complex as it is, existing IT systems can also be thought about as delivering a platform of services.<\/p>\n<p>Many years ago I helped a public organisation re-consider its existing IT as a valid set of services in what was then called a service-oriented architecture, and the platform principle is not so different. Start with working out the new services you need, build interfaces to legacy systems based on the facade pattern, and the rest is gravy. So, if an organisation is going to be using platforms of services from multiple providers, and if existing systems can be ring-fenced and considered as service platforms in their own right, what do we have but a multiplatform technology landscape?<\/p>\n<p>And why does it matter? Because this perspective takes us beyond notions of hybrid, which essentially refer to how cloud stuff needs to integrate with legacy stuff, and towards a principle that organisations should have a congruent set of services to build upon and innovate against. This is not simply thinking out loud, but has tangible consequences as organisations can think about how skills in platform engineering, architecture, delivery and orchestration will become future differentiators, and can start to plan for them now. For sure we will see service catalogues, marketplaces and the like, as there is nothing new under the sun. Most important however is for organisations to deliver the processes and mindsets that will enable them to make the most of such enablers in the future.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As I flew away from Amazon Web Services\u2019 Re:Invent developer conference, my first thought was how there is far, far more going&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87746169,"featured_media":951748,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[359218799],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951747"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87746169"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=951747"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951747\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/951748"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=951747"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=951747"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=951747"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":951740,"date":"2016-12-05T14:35:34","date_gmt":"2016-12-05T20:35:34","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=951740"},"modified":"2016-12-05T14:35:34","modified_gmt":"2016-12-05T20:35:34","slug":"how-ai-can-help-detect-filter-offensive-images-and-videos","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/12\/05\/how-ai-can-help-detect-filter-offensive-images-and-videos\/","title":{"rendered":"How AI can help detect &#038; filter offensive images and videos"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Advances in Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning have transformed the way computers understand images and videos.

Sightengine, an A.I. company, is making its <a href=\"https:\/\/sightengine.com\">image and video moderation service<\/a> available worldwide through a simple API. Built upon specialist Neural Networks, the API analyzes incoming images or videos and detects if they contain offensive material such as nudity, adult content or suggestive scenes.

As opposed to the networks that companies like Google, Facebook or Microsoft use for object detection, these neural networks are specialists, designed and trained to excel at one specific task.<\/p>\n<p>Historically, content moderation has been mostly in demand with Dating and Social Networking websites. They relied either on staff who had to go through user-submitted content manually, or on their community who had to flag and report content. But today, content moderation is no longer restricted to niche markets. As camera-equipped smartphones have become ubiquitous, and as the usage of social networks and self-expression tools have continued to rise, photo generation and sharing have literally exploded over the last few years.<\/p>\n<p>It is estimated that more than 3 Billion images are shared every day online, along with millions of hours of video streams.

Now, we have the cloud, the &#8220;Nutanixes&#8221; and all the software-defined-ish stuff you may need\u2026 why should someone buy a configurable piece of hardware from a company that doesn&#8217;t even own the whole stack and can&#8217;t give an iPhone-like experience? If only the rumours were true and Simplivity were the target of an acquisition\u2026 that would be something to talk about (and, probably, it would be as good as the 3PAR acquisition has been).<\/p>\n<h2>Server? Storage? What else?<\/h2>\n<p>Yes, HPE is the worldwide leader for server revenues and shipments. But this is a declining market. It&#8217;s not about the quality of the server it&#8217;s about the cloud eating up everything.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest infrastructure investments are made in large datacenters now, with SMEs looking to offload as much as they can to the cloud. Large datacenters are all about efficiency, they&#8217;re trying to squeeze everything they can from any resource and this is why they are doing more with fewer servers. Even more so, they don&#8217;t want any form of lock-in &#8211; hyper-scalers are designing their own equipment to take efficiency to the next level but they also want to make hardware vendors irrelevant. In fact, if you own the specification, and it&#8217;s an open standard, there is no way the hardware manufacturer will make a difference, if not in the price\u2026<\/p>\n<p>And what about Storage?&#8230;it&#8217;s even worse. Even though 3PAR is still doing well (in comparison to the rest of external market), external enterprise storage shipments and revenues are seeing trends which are comparable to servers. And so is the cause. Big datacenters look for very large, and cheap, capacity-driven infrastructures (massive scale-out infrastructures) and very low latency solutions (they look for CPU-storage vicinity).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/StorageReview-HPE-3PAR-20000.jpg\"><img src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/StorageReview-HPE-3PAR-20000-212x300.jpg\" alt=\"storagereview-hpe-3par-20000\" width=\"212\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-951737\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/StorageReview-HPE-3PAR-20000-212x300.jpg 212w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/StorageReview-HPE-3PAR-20000-481x680.jpg 481w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/StorageReview-HPE-3PAR-20000-99x140.jpg 99w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/StorageReview-HPE-3PAR-20000-18x25.jpg 18w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/StorageReview-HPE-3PAR-20000-35x50.jpg 35w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/StorageReview-HPE-3PAR-20000-300x424.jpg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/StorageReview-HPE-3PAR-20000-320x452.jpg 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/12\/StorageReview-HPE-3PAR-20000.jpg 531w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 212px) 100vw, 212px\" \/><\/a>The HPE 3PAR team is working on a very nice\/cool and seamless adoption of 3D Xpoint (as everyone else in this industry?!).

They are still evolving the same platform, which is still good for traditional applications and workloads, but not enough for next generation infrastructures. A 3D Xpoint powered 3Par can give 250 microseconds latency, while a 3DXpoint PCI card can give you 1\/10th of that!<\/p>\n<p>Storage as we know it today, will be less and less of interest and less relevant. In-memory (and CPU-driven), ephemeral or persistent storage is the future. Several startups are already working on it, most of them are delivering software solutions (not hardware, software!)

At least that\u2019s what Neeraj Sabharwal, Head of Cloud and Big Data at<a href=\"https:\/\/www.xavient.com\/\"> Xavient Information System<\/a>s is telling us.<\/p>\n<p>GigaOM had the opportunity to discuss the future of Big Data analytics with Sabharwal, who shared some interesting insights and statistics on how Big Data is poised to change in 2017. Sabharwal is no stranger to Big Data and has a long and storied<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/jareen\"> experience<\/a> with the technology.<\/p>\n<p>Sabharwal told GigaOM that Xavient has been analyzing customer trends, as well as Big Data technology adoption to come up with predictions that should come to light in 2017. Sabharwal said \u201cWorking with our internal team, we came to several conclusions, which will directly impact the financial markets.\u201d Those conclusions include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Banks will seek the ability to access even more accurate data and in near real-time, allowing institutions to be more cost efficient, and more profitable.<\/li>\n<li>There will be an increased focus on customer engagement and the customer experience vs. traditional focus on customer service through the innovated application of big data and predictive analytics that allow organizations to provide better customized services.<\/li>\n<li>Institutions will seek the development of &#8220;sentiment analysis&#8221; technology that provides a gauge on individual customer satisfaction levels.<\/li>\n<li>There will be an accelerated evolution of cloud technology and its growing acceptance in banks and financial services organizations, and the pressures &#8212; cyber, legacy system issues, growing data sets &#8212; that are forcing the hands of banking IT execs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u201cNaturally, those predictions will have a much farther reach than just the financial sector, impacting everything from retail to healthcare to government services,\u201d said Sabharwal. \u201cThe key factor here is that with financial organizations leading the way, successes will grow and other industries will take notice.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That said, the transformation of Big Data into something more won\u2019t happen overnight. A fact that many analyst firms agree with. For example, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gartner.com\/newsroom\/id\/3466117\">Gartner<\/a> revealed at its October Business Intelligence &amp; Analytics Summit 2016, in Munich, that surveys show that 48 percent of companies have invested in Big Data in 2016, up 3 percent from 2015. However, those who plan to invest in Big Data within the next two years fell from 31 to 25 percent in 2016. Nick Heudecker, research director at Gartner said, &#8220;Investment in Big Data is up, but the survey is showing signs of slowing growth with fewer companies having a future intent to invest. The big issue is not so much Big Data itself, but rather how it is used.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A statement that falls in line with Sabharwal\u2019s predictions. Sabharwal added, \u201cGrowth may be slowing, but the amount of data, both structured and unstructured, is increasing exponentially. It all comes down to how Big Data is being used.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Therein lies the conundrum. Businesses today have more data than ever, which is growing rapidly, but if they do not know how to leverage that data, it becomes almost impossible to demonstrate the value of any Big Data project. &#8220;This could be due to the fact that many Big Data projects don&#8217;t have a tangible return on investment (ROI) that can be determined upfront,&#8221; said Heudecker. &#8220;Another reason could be that the Big Data initiative is a part of a larger funded initiative. This will become more common as the term &#8220;Big Data&#8221; fades away, and dealing with larger datasets and multiple data types continues to be the norm.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat is the very reason why companies like Xavient exist,\u201d said Sabharwal. He added \u201cXavient is committed to providing customers with tailored capabilities and solution flexibility and making our real-time data analysis solutions ubiquitous in an enterprise.\u201d A statement backed by Xavient\u2019s further commitment to supporting the <a href=\"http:\/\/ctt.marketwire.com\/?release=11G121810-001&amp;id=10237837&amp;type=0&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.odpi.org%2fodpi-end-users%2finteroperable-apps\">ODPi Interoperable Compliance Program<\/a> for its DiP (Data Ingestion Platform), a real-time data analysis application, and ensuring its ability to successfully run on multiple ODPi Runtime Compliant Platforms.<\/p>\n<p>While Sabharwal is certain that his predictions will be on the money and the creation of Big Data is destined to grow, the most important issue facing Big Data in 2017, is just knowing what to do with it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The transformation of Big Data into something more won\u2019t happen overnight!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8020068,"featured_media":872580,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[359256651,11453,359216021,359223158,480103,359220112,189241],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951732"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8020068"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=951732"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951732\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/872580"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=951732"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=951732"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=951732"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":951730,"date":"2016-12-01T13:53:05","date_gmt":"2016-12-01T19:53:05","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=951730"},"modified":"2016-12-01T16:32:03","modified_gmt":"2016-12-01T22:32:03","slug":"kemp_azure","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/12\/01\/kemp_azure\/","title":{"rendered":"The Specter of Performance and the Adoption of Hybrid Clouds"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>2016 has been acknowledged as the year of the hybrid cloud, with explosive growth still forecasted for the coming years. \u201cIn fact, 2016 will be a big year for solutions built on hybrid cloud architectures with 65% of Asia Pacific enterprises to commit for its implementation\u201d, said Chris Morris, Vice President, Cloud and Services, IDC.<\/p>\n<p>Other analysts agree, Holly Maloney McConnell, a Principal at North Bridge Growth Equity, said &#8220;Cloud has been gaining momentum year by year. Looking at the adoption rates and trends at such a detailed level, it&#8217;s undeniable that the most successful technology leaders of today and tomorrow are scaling in the cloud.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In the latest iteration of North Bridge&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.northbridge.com\/2016-future-cloud-computing-survey\">The Future of Cloud Computing Survey<\/a>&#8220;, some unique perspectives into cloud adoption trends, were revealed. The survey showed that public cloud adoption increased by over 43% since 2011, while private cloud adoption increased over 48% in the same period. However, hybrid cloud adoption had grown to 20% since 2011 for those surveyed, which consisted of nearly 1000 survey participants.<\/p>\n<p>Cloud technologies and the concept of bridging public and private cloud offerings has become so ubiquitous in business today, that a new narrative of interconnection is being written by those slaving away in data centers. A narrative that almost borders on a &#8220;cloud first&#8221; ideology. However, the move to hybrid cloud solutions is much easier said than done.<\/p>\n<p>One of the biggest challenges comes in the specter of performance, a poltergeist that adds latency to transactions and is further empowered by physical distances. A challenge that<a href=\"https:\/\/kemptechnologies.com\/\"> KEMP Technologies<\/a> co-founder and Chief Marketing Officer Peter Melerud is well aware of. \u00a0After all, KEMP is in the business of load balancing and ADC (Application Delivery Control), two technologies normally associated with traditional data centers.<\/p>\n<p>Melerud said \u201cHybrid Clouds are introducing a new performance dynamic to the enterprise. One that combines both the benefits and shortcomings of cloud and on premise technology.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Melerud added \u201cNowhere is that more evident than with upcoming technologies, such as Microsoft\u2019s Azure Stack.\u201d Microsoft Azure Stack is a hybrid cloud platform that enables organizations to deliver Azure services from within their own data centers. It is the potential of that new paradigm that will fuel and accelerate hybrid cloud growth, yet adopters will need to be ready for the performance implications that come with hybrid cloud deployments.<\/p>\n<p>To that end, Kemp has redeveloped<a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/marketplace\/partners\/kemptech\/vlm-azure\/\"> Virtual LoadMaster (VLM) for Azure<\/a> to work effectively with Azure Stack. That effort resulted in an offering that brings load balancing to a hybrid cloud deployment, without having to invest in new onsite hardware. A critical consideration for those looking to adopt hybrid clouds, without the typical expenses associates with re-engineering on premise solutions to operate as private clouds. Kemp <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ycTCRUAjaAo\">publicly demoed the technology<\/a> in September of 2016, offering a view into how to achieve hybrid cloud technology.<\/p>\n<p>Kurt Jung, Senior Research Analyst at KEMP technologies said \u201cSince KEMP Loadmaster already provides advanced application delivery on physical appliances, bare metal, virtual, and cloud, it only makes sense that KEMP would jump into Azure Stack so early to kick the tires.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of the biggest challenges comes in the specter of performance, a poltergeist that adds latency to transactions and is further empowered by physical distances. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8020068,"featured_media":920577,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[13272731,359220143,359256649,359218029,24246322,359256650,310703],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951730"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8020068"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=951730"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951730\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920577"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=951730"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=951730"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=951730"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":951442,"date":"2016-11-29T13:59:37","date_gmt":"2016-11-29T19:59:37","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=951442"},"modified":"2016-11-29T14:13:02","modified_gmt":"2016-11-29T20:13:02","slug":"the-2017-state-of-the-service-economy-report","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/11\/29\/the-2017-state-of-the-service-economy-report\/","title":{"rendered":"The 2017 State of the Services Economy\u00a0Report"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019m happy to announce the release of <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">the 2017 State of the Services Economy Report <\/em>that I worked on for the past six months with <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https:\/\/www.mavenlink.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-href=\"https:\/\/www.mavenlink.com\/\">Mavenlink<\/a>, one of the best reports I worked on in the past several years.

Events over recent months in the UK and USA, two nations divided by a common language, have led to a swathe of commentary expressing disbelief and anger alongside the jubilation and enactment. \u201cThey were all stupid,\u201d says one side; \u201cStop moaning and get over it, losers,\u201d says the other. No doubt the name calling will continue.<\/p>\n<p>But what does any of this mean for an industry whose central purpose is to collate, process and deliver information? In the midst of it all lies a common theme, that of seeing data and facts as only one element of the debate, and an apparently low-priority element to boot. \u201cPeople have had enough of experts,\u201d said Brexit campaigner Michael Gove MP, even as his side laid out its own, fact-light agenda.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s give \u00a3350 million to the National Health Service,\u201d they said, a promise Brexiters had no intention of keeping. They couldn\u2019t: it wasn\u2019t ever up to them, even if such an idea was even possible. Remainers had their own \u201cProject Fear\u201d meanwhile: a string of catastrophic consequences that would inevitably occur should the vote go against them. Many won\u2019t, to the quiet delight of everybody.<\/p>\n<p>As it turns out, neither \u2018facts\u2019 nor \u2018promises\u2019 mattered in Brexit; nor did they have much of a place in the Presidential election. Voters really didn\u2019t appear care about the potential negative consequences, about historical misdemeanours, about promises that could never be kept (cf that some parts of the wall with Mexico becoming a fence \u2014 &#8220;I&#8217;m very good at this, it&#8217;s called construction,\u201d said Trump).<\/p>\n<p>It turns out that Michael Gove was right. People really had had enough of experts to the extent that they would, in both cases, appear to vote for the unknown rather than the known. \u201cI think people just wanted to see what would happen,\u201d a taxi driver said to me a few days ago. I\u2019m not sure he is right; rather, I believe that we, as a species, have proved ourselves unable to appreciate the much bigger picture of what has been going on.<\/p>\n<p>Over time we will unpick the reasons why people voted one way or another, and perhaps arrive at some conclusions: the data about voting attitudes, as well as reviewing historical factors through past decades, will no doubt reveal some truths. But if there is anything we can take from the current situation, it is that our current\u00a0analytical abilities\u00a0cannot necessarily reveal future behaviours.<\/p>\n<p>Addressing this, deeper truth is of fundamental importance. If I had to put my money anywhere, it is that the models we use have completely failed to grasp the geo-political and psychological complexity of the situation. Condemning voters of either side as \u2018stupid\u2019 is symptomatic of this failure: they must be stupid, because they have done the inexplicable, right? Wrong, it is our ability to explain what is going on that is lacking, not \u2018their\u2019 decision making skills.<\/p>\n<p>If we did understand such things at a deeper level we might be able to see more clearly the causes of current voter behaviours and indeed, do something about them. It may be for example that the seeds of recent events were sown back in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, way before social media (which is taking the brunt of criticism) was a \u2018thing\u2019. Even armed with such an understanding however, we might still struggle to predict the unexpected from happening again.<\/p>\n<p>Why? Due to the very characteristics that make us human in the first place. We are quick to jump to conclusions; we have agendas; we prefer to act on less information rather than waiting for a complete picture, particularly if it might go against what we want to do. We hunger for control, we often act in ways against our longer-term interests. And, frequently, we seek to justify our actions and positions using data that fits with our views, ignoring all that does not.<\/p>\n<p>We know all of this. Lies, damn lies and statistics, we say, as if the data is the problem, rather than our propensity to interpret it selectively. The pollsters got it so, so wrong, yet still we use them. And while they are global and virtual, the echo chambers we inhabit today are no different to the past. So we share information that reflects our views, suppressing the &#8220;clearly biased&#8221; views of others. It is ironic that we even have a very human notion \u2014 of irony \u2014 to explain this phenomenon.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile however, we continue to build information systems as if data holds some hallowed, incorruptible place in our lives. It doesn\u2019t: we only have to look at how the oh-so-open Twitter has been castigated for harbouring trolls, or Facebook\u2019s fake news issues, to see how vulnerable data can be to human behaviour. The models we build into systems design are equally subject to bias; the architectures assume people will be good first, and then are patched in response to the rediscovery that they are not.<\/p>\n<p>Right now, we are seeing a renewed wave of interest in Artificial Intelligence, the latest attempt to create algorithms that might unlock the secrets contained in the mountains of data we create. Such algorithms will not deliver on their promise, not while they are controlled by human beings whose desires to be right are so strong they are prepared to ignore even the most self-evident of facts. And that means all of us. A failure to understand this will continue us on a path to inadequate understanding and denial of the real truth that lies beneath.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What the heck just happened?

A revelation that may take most IT managers and staffers by surprise is that this statistic is expected to increase to 77% within the next two years. With more companies turning to the cloud first, IT organizations will need to do some serious re-tooling to successfully navigate through this new era.<\/p>\n<p>Allan Leinwand, chief technology officer at ServiceNow told GigaOM that \u201ccloud first initiatives are forcing IT to rethink their skillsets\u201d. What Leinwand is talking about is the potential sea of change that IT will have to accommodate as staffers transition from provisioning servers, storage and building private data centers to becoming the purveyors of cloud services.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to reaching a Cloud-First \u201ctipping point,\u201d\u00a0 ServiceNow\u2019s research revealed that the nascent DevOps movement, which is seizing the mantle of a cloud first ideology, is rapidly becoming favored by the enterprise. DevOps has quickly become the poster child of the agile development movement, backed by a revealing statistic, where 76% of those surveyed opined that DevOps is driving the shift to cloud first.<\/p>\n<p>This statistic may be a sign of trouble for IT. After all, cloud initiatives have always fallen under the auspices of the IT department, with IT managers dealing with the disruptive nature of the cloud. In other words, IT management had assumed that when it came to the cloud, that they would be leading the charge.<\/p>\n<p>Leinwand added \u201cDevOps is being embraced across the enterprise and is no longer being relegated to just IT departments.\u201d\u00a0 The survey backs Leinwand\u2019s claims, with 63% of respondents stating that DevOps is a philosophy to be taught to existing departments, rather than a new division.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, the survey points out that IT must evolve, if it expects to survive the transition of business processes to the cloud. 89% of those surveyed have completed the shift to a cloud-first model, said their current IT staff lacked the skillsets needed to help them make this to shift. Yet, there is still hope for traditional IT, with 72% surveyed saying this cloud-first shift actually increases IT\u2019s relevancy to the business, with 68% stating that IT will become essential in the future.<\/p>\n<p>The rapid growth in cloud adoption has been fueled by pressures to transform line of business processes into digital environments, with the LOB leaders looking to adopt solutions that can scale and adapt on demand. To achieve that lofty goal of digital transformation, IT executives must become part of the process. In other words, IT management needs to become the facilitators of tactical decisions that are made by corporate leaders, and also work hand in hand with DevOps to optimize the resources needed to drive business.<\/p>\n<p>While those numbers may seem like mixed signals, it all comes down to how IT is viewed in the corporate environment and how LOB leaders think IT should participate, a revelation backed by some 65% stating that they want IT to operate as a strategic partner.<\/p>\n<p>The call to action for IT comes in the form of communicating with the rest of the company and consider agile ideologies to help fuel a cloud first movement. By becoming a strategic partner to the business, IT can increase its relevancy and be part of the digital transformation era. ServiceNow\u2019s survey offers additional advice and statistics for those looking to transform IT into a cloud friendly, enablement partner for the enterprise.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This statistic may be a sign of trouble for IT<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8020068,"featured_media":920081,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[359218029,1736,86178],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951356"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8020068"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=951356"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951356\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920081"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=951356"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=951356"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=951356"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":951349,"date":"2016-11-11T11:44:09","date_gmt":"2016-11-11T17:44:09","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=951349"},"modified":"2016-11-23T10:52:42","modified_gmt":"2016-11-23T16:52:42","slug":"customer-experience-matters-but-customer-confidence-matters-more","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/11\/11\/customer-experience-matters-but-customer-confidence-matters-more\/","title":{"rendered":"Customer experience matters, but customer confidence matters more"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Some things in life are better understood by the historical gap they reveal.

The lowly automobile, whose previous \u2018interface\u2019 consisted of a rubber-coated wheel and a few levers or pedals, has been upgraded to enable interactions between manufacturer (itself hastily wondering how to become a\u00a0service company) and traveller.\u00a0<br class=\"\" \/><br class=\"\" \/>While CX is important in terms of helping people interact with services, it should not be seen as the whole story. From a CX perspective, measures of success might, for example, be the number of times an app is used, or the\u00a0transactions through a given web site. Such results are interesting and valuable, but they are only one part of a relationship between a person and an organisation. Like an iceberg they represent the part above the surface, while\u00a0much more potential exists underneath.\u00a0<br class=\"\" \/><br class=\"\" \/>As the automobile example suggests, simple interactions can only take a relationship so far. Existing rhetoric from companies such as BMW suggests that companies are relying on existing brand loyalty \u2014 in BMW\u2019s case this\u00a0relationship may be stronger, but not every manufacturer can depend on people buying a make of car simply because they always have.\u00a0<br class=\"\" \/><br class=\"\" \/>So-called stickiness \u2014 the propensity for someone to return to a given supplier next time around \u2014 applies just as much for large-ticket items. We see this with travel sites, which rely on a user\u2019s previous experience not only in\u00a0terms of lowest cost but ease of use and potential bonus features. As a result, we can see CX as a means to a deeper end, namely customer engagement, retention and ultimately propensity towards a given brand.\u00a0<br class=\"\" \/><br class=\"\" \/>This may appear a broad point but it has some quite specific ramifications, notably in terms of how much customers trust how suppliers collate and use the data surrounding each transaction. As a recent example shows, where\u00a0Facebook blocked a UK insurer from scanning posts to determine a potential customer\u2019s risk profile, not all use of customer data is going to result in their increased desire to work with a company (in this case, one could expect the\u00a0opposite).\u00a0<br class=\"\" \/><br class=\"\" \/>In other words, CX is just one facet of overall customer confidence in a transaction, in its supplier and in the brand it represents. While customer may choose not to use an app because it is awkward, equally they are not going to\u00a0trust a brand that seeks to exploit them. As we become increasingly transparent in our doings, the trust we have in our suppliers needs to increase commensurately. So, by all means focus on CX but retain focus on the longer-term\u00a0strategy to ensure customers want to keep coming back.<\/p>\n<p>Image source: <a href=\"https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:CSM_Customer_Satisfaction_Monitor_Patienteneinweisung.png?uselang=en-gb\">Wikimedia<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Some things in life are better understood by the historical gap they reveal.

In another part of the report, 78% of CIOs noted how <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2016\/10\/31\/employee-productivity-when-keeping-personal-and-business-data-separate-makes-sense-and-when-it-doesnt\/\">data security<\/a> was the biggest issue they faced with relation to use of cloud services.<\/p>\n<p>When this was broken into specifics, 61% reported the threat of increasingly sophisticated social engineering attacks, with <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2016\/09\/19\/top-tips-how-to-avoid-ransomware-attacks\/\">ransomware<\/a> and corporate extortion a close second at 56%. In other words, the most significant threats were people-oriented.\u00a0<br class=\"\" \/><br class=\"\" \/>The response is straightforward to state, in principle \u2014 that people creating new cloud-based and mobile apps and services should be thinking about, and <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2016\/04\/27\/mobile-security-for-businesses-determining-your-risk-appetite\/\">mitigating<\/a> the security ramifications. Are they doing so?\u00a0<br class=\"\" \/><br class=\"\" \/>Frankly, I doubt it. Survey after survey over the years has seen security as the poor cousin of technology, left until last in the priority list. Unless lines of business have reached some kind of epiphany about IT security that their forebears in the IT department never managed,\u00a0this will still be the case.<br class=\"\" \/><br class=\"\" \/>Indeed, it is likely that the IT department will still carry the can for a security breach, even if the source of the problem is a line of business.

It wasn\u2019t unique: purveyors of different interests gathered at a variety of venues around the area. Edward first built his hot beverage business on back of the maritime community, but he was quick to see the potential went way beyond mere coffee.<\/p>\n<p>Fast forward to the present day, and what do we see? Companies around the\u00a0globe are looking to enhance their working environments with creative spaces, and indeed, many serviced offices incorporate coffee houses in their lobbies. Meanwhile terms like \u2018co-creation\u2019 and \u2018hackathon\u2019 are in vogue as organisations look to change the way they work with their partners, collaborators and customers.<\/p>\n<p>The parallels with how 17<sup>th<\/sup> Century merchants and insurers looked outside the probably stuffy and unproductive working environment of the Royal Exchange are clear. Put simply, back then as today, people found they could get more done in a coffee house than in the place originally set up for the job.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, we can learn several lessons from Edward Lloyd and his peers, about how to make the most of working outside the building.<\/p>\n<p>First, Lloyd was quick to spot the need for good data. He launched a newsletter in 1696: while this lasted only a year due to libel action, he continued to harvest and supply maritime information to his customers which, of course, kept them coming back.<\/p>\n<p>Second, he recognised that the coffee house was a place for work, and was restructured accordingly. Rooms became offices and the house became a venue for auctions and other business.<\/p>\n<p>Third and perhaps most important, was the recognition that Lloyd\u2019s customers were a community in their own right. The group formed what became known as the Lloyd\u2019s List, the structure of which has been maintained right up to present-day, globally-spanning, billion-plus business that Lloyd\u2019s of London has become.<\/p>\n<p>In 1774, some hundred years after Edward Lloyd\u2019s coffee house first came to prominence, its growing underwriting business found new lodgings \u2013 not ironically, back in the Royal Exchange building. The coffee house had served its purpose as an external space where peers could collaborate away from the clutter of daily work, and such collaboration could now continue from whence it came.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps this is a final lesson: that work itself is collaboration, and that the healthy body corporate will seek the best possible environment to function, wherever it may be. As well as looking at information delivery, creating a place for doing business and seeing people as a community, today\u2019s organisations would do well to remember that offices should serve as\u00a0a backdrop to enterprise, not as an end in themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Image: Wikimedia\/Phogel<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When Welshman Edward Lloyd first founded his London coffee shop in the late 1600s, it became a popular alternative venue to the&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87746169,"featured_media":951354,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951353"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87746169"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=951353"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951353\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/951354"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=951353"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=951353"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=951353"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":951299,"date":"2016-11-10T09:47:45","date_gmt":"2016-11-10T15:47:45","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=951299"},"modified":"2016-11-10T09:47:45","modified_gmt":"2016-11-10T15:47:45","slug":"serverless-enabled-storage-its-a-big-deal","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/11\/10\/serverless-enabled-storage-its-a-big-deal\/","title":{"rendered":"Serverless-enabled storage?

It&#8217;s not for all use cases, of course, but the technology is intriguing, easy to implement and developers (and sysadmins!) can leverage it to offload some tasks to the infrastructure and automate a lot of operations that, otherwise, would be necessary to do at the application level, with a lower level of efficiency.<\/p>\n<p>The code ( a Function) is triggered by events and object storage is perfect for this.<\/p>\n<h2>Why object storage<\/h2>\n<p>Object storage is usually implemented with a shared-nothing scale-out cluster design. Each node of the cluster has its own capacity, CPU, RAM and network connections. At the same time, modern CPUs are very powerful and usually underutilized when the only scope of the storage node is to access objects. By allowing the storage system to use its spare CPU cycles to run Functions, we obtain a sort of very efficient hyperconverged infrastructure (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.juku.it\/en\/hyper-convergence-divergence-micro-convergence\/\" target=\"_blank\">micro-converged?<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Usually, we tend to bring data close to the CPU but in this case we do the exact opposite (we take advantage of CPU power which is already close to the data), obtaining even better results. <strong>CPU-data vicinity<\/strong> coupled with event triggered micro-services is a very powerful concept that can radically change data and storage management.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Scalability<\/strong>, is not an issue. CPU power increases alongside the number of nodes and the code is instantiated asynchronously and in parallel, triggered by events. This also means that response time, hence performance, is not always predictable and consistent but, for the kind of operations and services that come to mind, it&#8217;s good enough.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Object metadata<\/strong> is another important key element. In fact, the Function can easily access data and metadata of the object that triggered it. Adding and modifying information is child&#8217;s play\u2026 helping to build additional information about content for example.<\/p>\n<p>These are only a few examples, but the list of characteristics that make scale-out storage suitable for this kind of advanced data service is quite long. In general, it&#8217;s important to note that, thanks to the architecture design of this type of system, this functionality can boost efficiency of the infrastructure at an unprecedented level while improving application agility. It&#8217;s no coincidence that most of the triggering events implemented by cloud providers are related to their object storage service.<\/p>\n<h2>Possible applications<\/h2>\n<p>Ok, Serverless-enabled storage is cool but what can I do with it? <\/p>\n<p>Even though this kind of system is not specifically designed to provide low latency responses, there are a lot of applications, even real time applications, can make use of this feature. Here are some examples:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Image recognition<\/strong>: for each new image that lands in the storage system, a process can verify relevant information (identify a person, check a plate number, analyze the quality of the image, classify the image by its characteristics, make comparisons and so on). All this new data can be added as metadata or in the object itself.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Security<\/strong>: for each new, or modified, file in the system, a process can verify if it contains a virus, sensitive information, specific patterns (i.e. credit card numbers) and take proper action.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.juku.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Analytics-300x206.jpeg\" alt=\"A businessman or an employee is drawing an analytics optimisation chart on the glass screen in a modern panoramic office in New York.\" width=\"300\" height=\"206\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-15326\" \/><strong>Analytics<\/strong>: each action performed on an object can trigger a simple piece of code to populate a DB with relevant information.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Data normalization<\/strong>: every new piece of information added to the system can be easily verified and converted to other formats. This could be useful in complex IoT environments for example, where different types of data sources contribute to a single large database.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Big Data<\/strong>: AWS has already published a reference architecture for Map\/Reduce jobs running on S3 and Lambda! (<a href=\"https:\/\/thehftguy.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">here The link<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>And, as mentioned earlier, these are only the first examples that come to my mind. The only limit here is one&#8217;s imagination. <\/p>\n<h2>Back-end is the key<\/h2>\n<p>There are only a few serverless-enabled storage products at the moment, with others under development and coming in 2017.  But I found two key factors that make this kind of solution viable in real production environments.<\/p>\n<p>The first is multiple language support &#8211; in fact the product should be capable of running different types of code so as not to limit its possibilities. The second, is the internal process\/Function scheduler. We are talking about a complex system which shares resources between storage and compute (in a hyperconverged fashion) and resource management is essential in order to grant the right level of performance and response time for storage and applications.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most interesting Serverless-enabled products I&#8217;m aware of is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.openio.io\" target=\"_blank\">OpenIO<\/a>. The feature is called Grid For Apps while another component called Conscience technology is in charge of internal load balancing, data placement and overall resource management. The implementation is pretty slick and efficient. The product is open source, and there is a free download from their website. I strongly suggest taking a look at it to understand the potential of this technology. I installed it in a few minutes, and if I can do it\u2026 anyone can.<\/p>\n<h2>No standards\u2026  yet<\/h2>\n<p>Contrary to object storage, where the de facto standard is S3 API, Serverless is quite new and with no winner yet. Consequently, there are neither official nor de facto standards to look at.<\/p>\n<p>I think it will take a while before one of these services will prevail over the others but, at that time, API compatibility won&#8217;t be hard to achieve. Most of these services have the same goal and similar functionalities\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>Closing the circle<\/h2>\n<p>Data storage as we know it is a thing of the past. <a href=\"\/?p=14712\" target=\"_blank\">More and more end users are looking at object storage, even when the capacity requirement is under 100TB<\/a>.  Many begin with one application (usually as a replacement of traditional file services) but after grasping its full potential it gets adopted for more use cases ranging from backup to back-end for IoT applications through APIs.<\/p>\n<p>Serverless-enabled storage is a step forward and introduces a new class of advanced data services which will help to simplify storage and data management. It has a huge potential, and I&#8217;m keeping my eye on it\u2026 I suggest you do the same.<\/p>\n<p>Originally posted on <a href=\"http:\/\/juku.it\">Juku.it<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The success of services like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions or Google Cloud Functions is indisputable.

Prototyping is much easier and inexpensive while the community ecosystem is growing exponentially. Raspberry Pi, and all its clones, are not designed for the datacenter of course\u2026 but it is also true that this small computer has inspired a lot of people and is at the base of some very cool projects, including <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/article\/build-your-own-supercomputer-out-of-raspberry-pi-boards\/\" target=\"_blank\">HPC<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.docker.com\/2016\/07\/swarm-mode-on-a-raspberry-pi-cluster\/\" target=\"_blank\">Docker Swarm clusters<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h2>The next step<\/h2>\n<p>ARM CPUs are particularly efficient when it comes to power consumption and now they are becoming more and more powerful. What&#8217;s more, these CPUs are usually designed with a SoC approach (System-on-a-Chip), which simply means that the CPU already contains a lot of other components needed to build a computer. In fact, multiple cores are often coupled with a GPU, network and storage controllers and so on.<\/p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t mean more compute power per se, but actually more compute power and less power consumption per square centimeter. And this is what datacenter architects are craving for!<\/p>\n<h2>Back to the datacenter<\/h2>\n<p>Contrary to the past, there are now all the components ready to build a successful ARM-based datacenter ecosystem. CPUs don&#8217;t have the same compute performance per core compared to x86 CPUs, but it is also true that many applications and workloads work in a massive parallel fashion and container development will help to improve this trend furthermore. And, at the end of the day, for many workloads, compute power density is becoming more important than single core performance.<\/p>\n<p>Other aspects include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>software which is much more optimized than in the past,<\/li>\n<li>64 bit ARM CPUs,  which are much more mature now,<\/li>\n<li>Automation and Orchestration tools, which are now ready to handle hundreds of thousands of nodes in a single infrastructure.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Now ARM CPUs are relegated to small appliances, or as a component of larger x86-based systems, but this could change pretty soon. I want to mention <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kaleao.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Kaleao<\/a> here, a startup working on an interesting ARM-based HCI solution. This is just an example, but there are many others working on ARM-based solutions for the datacenter now.<\/p>\n<h2>Closing the circle<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/data-center-stuff.jpg\"><img src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/data-center-stuff-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Server room.\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-951123\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/data-center-stuff-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/data-center-stuff-210x140.jpg 210w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/data-center-stuff-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/data-center-stuff-680x453.jpg 680w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/data-center-stuff-968x645.jpg 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/data-center-stuff-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/data-center-stuff-205x137.jpg 205w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/data-center-stuff-175x117.jpg 175w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/data-center-stuff-38x25.jpg 38w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/data-center-stuff-75x50.jpg 75w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/data-center-stuff-320x213.jpg 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/data-center-stuff-640x427.jpg 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/data-center-stuff-804x536.jpg 804w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a>ARM has its potential in the datacenter, but we&#8217;ve been saying that for years now, and reality has always shown the contrary.

We&#8217;ve seen social networks for questions and answers, Quora, for friends, Facebook, for developers, GitHub. The world has not yet seen a successful social network for data and the people who work with it, and I find that kind of baffling, because data is often something that is hard to understand without proper communication and context. There are many issues which prevent it from being easily analyzed and put to use. For example, government agencies put out data, change the format year to year, change the taxonomy and the ontologies every so often, so all of that needs to be documented and understood before the data makes sense. <\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve spent, as a nation, just a massive amount of money funding these &#8220;industrial strength&#8221; analytics platforms, but we haven&#8217;t addressed the core problem: garbage in, garbage out. <\/p>\n<p>Data people are spending 50% &#8211; 80% of their time as &#8220;data janitors,&#8221; finding, cleaning, and otherwise preparing data for use\u2014before they can get to the real exploration, analysis, and ultimately, the solutions to the problems they&#8217;re working on. We call this frustrating janitorial stage the &#8220;first mile&#8221; of data work. Most of this work happens in isolation, and all that preparation is used once and forgotten. But what if it could be shared with other data people working with the same datasets and tackling similar problems so they don&#8217;t have to needlessly repeat it? What if preparation itself could be done collaboratively? <\/p>\n<p>And the most important question: What if we reduced prep time from 80% to 30%, or 10%? <\/p>\n<p>Think about that productivity boost to data workers. If they spent less time preparing data, they could solve important problems faster, create new knowledge faster. <\/p>\n<p>So we&#8217;re bringing them together, giving them a powerful collaboration workspace, and linking datasets to make it happen. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Where are you in the lifecycle of the company?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/11\/logo-color-300x300.png\" alt=\"logo-color\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-951264\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/11\/logo-color-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/11\/logo-color-85x85.png 85w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/11\/logo-color-50x50.png 50w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/11\/logo-color-180x180.png 180w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/11\/logo-color-140x140.png 140w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/11\/logo-color-48x48.png 48w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/11\/logo-color-25x25.png 25w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/11\/logo-color-320x320.png 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/11\/logo-color.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>Our preview release launched July 11th, and things are going extremely well. We&#8217;ve got lots of people signing up, and it&#8217;s really neat to see who comes in. From corporate analysts, to people in government, to citizen data scientists, and even cities&#8211;recently the city of San Diego and the city of Austin signed up. As we&#8217;re in preview release, we can really study exactly what users are doing, exactly what features they&#8217;re asking for. We have a daily metrics standup where we look for patterns, create experiments, share results. It&#8217;s revving very quickly, we&#8217;re coming out with around 4 or 5 new feature releases each week. This is the fastest pace of execution of any startup I&#8217;ve been with, and this is my 6th startup personally. Even though we&#8217;re in preview, the platform is already very powerful and anybody can visit data.world today and sign up for free\u2014no waitlist. We&#8217;re working on adding more and more social features so it really has the best qualities of a social network.  <\/p>\n<p>Stepping back for a moment, we&#8217;ve been at this now for about a year. We stayed in stealth mode for several months prior to raising money for the company. Before any business I&#8217;ve ever launched, from Bazaarvoice to Coremetrics, to others, I spent a lot of time in analysis to make sure that the market timing is right, that we&#8217;re building the right type of team, that we&#8217;re really learning from previous people in the industry. We really felt like the market timing was great, we went out there to raise capital in December, and as you know, Byron, we&#8217;re Austin-based. We started on November 29th, for our capital raise right after Thanksgiving, and we actually signed on December 15th, for our $14M Series A, then quickly closed that round in January. <\/p>\n<p>So we were off to the races on the fundraising front, and now we&#8217;re in that mode of having just launched the preview, all that initial excitement that accumulates around something that&#8217;s so ambitious, and we really believe we&#8217;ve built something that can do so much good for the world. To those ends, we&#8217;ve set up the company as a public benefit corporation, and it&#8217;s the first time in my entrepreneurial career to actually launch a public benefit corporation. I&#8217;m happy to speak about that as well. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Please do.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve founded C corporations in the past, and to be honest, I didn&#8217;t know what a public benefit corporation was. I&#8217;m involved in the Henry Crown Fellowship, which is the flagship program of The Aspen Institute, and it&#8217;s really amazing. You&#8217;re basically put with 21 to 22 fellows each year, and I was fortunate enough to get in the program. The fellows are very diverse. Previous Fellows in tech include Reid Hoffman, Aneel Bhusri (co-founder and CEO of Workday), Reid Hastings, and so many others, but there&#8217;s also many prominent people from government, non-profits, musicians like Lupe Fiasco. <\/p>\n<p>The program gets you really thinking about your utility as a human being, like what is your ultimate value to the world? And it has had a profound impact on me, which combined with support from my family, got me to actually step back into the arena to launch data.world. The Henry Crown program exposed me to benefit corporations, because the founders of B Lab, the leading certification service for benefit corporations, are also Henry Crown fellows and recently won an award for their work from The Aspen Institute. Benefit corps (also know as B-Corps) include Etsy, Patagonia, Ben &#038; Jerry&#8217;s\u2014there&#8217;s quite a few of them out there. <\/p>\n<p>The more I dug into it, the more I realized that it was so aligned with what data.world is doing. Ultimately, the way we\u2019re going to get to a world of clean, interoperable data, the type of data that would make that onboard computer from Star Trek possible: you talk to it, ask it any question you could think of, and boom, it would give you your answer. What we have with Siri today is just the beginning. The better the data, the better the output. But that clean data is going to take a lot of people improving it, sharing, collaborating, so that everybody has access to the fruits of that labor: the best, cleanest dataset on any subject, and thus the best starting point for data people trying to solve problems in that domain. This is what it will take to stop Zika in its tracks, to cure cancer sooner, to quickly find viable solutions to climate change\u2014all of these critical projects are fundamentally data-driven. <\/p>\n<p>The public benefit corporation structure is a lot like a C corporation, it&#8217;s really a sister or brother to the C corporation, vs. an LLC or S-corp, but it has the added benefit of protecting the mission of the company, and allowing you to publicly report on progress against that mission in kind of the same ways you would report on your finances. <\/p>\n<p>Here is our public benefit statement, or mission: <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The specific public benefit purposes of the Corporation are to (a) strive to build the most meaningful, collaborative and abundant data resource in the world in order to maximize data&#8217;s societal problem-solving utility, (b) advocate publicly for improving the adoption, usability, and proliferation of open data and linked data, and (c) serve as an accessible historical repository of the world&#8217;s data.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s been extremely well-received in our launch. When we go in and we speak with people in universities where there&#8217;s lots of data silos ready to be freed and used by the public, or we go in and speak with government decision-makers, they really value our public benefit status and are much more willing to partner. The public and official nature of our mission makes us accountable and creates trust. It shows we care deeply about what we&#8217;re doing. <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m lucky to have three co-founders who are all entrepreneurs, and all had been successful executives at HomeAway leading up to that acquisition by Expedia, and we\u2019re proud that our mission is baked not only into the way we operate, but the actual legal structure of the company itself.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You touched on things like cancer and Zika and all of that, what are your hopes for the things that are done with the data. Where do you see the biggest contributions of what you\u2019re doing, to the world?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well there are so many problems in the world that would be solved faster if people were collaborating more using high-quality data. Vice President Biden launched the Cancer Moonshot after his son passed away from brain cancer, and everyone knows someone who has been affected by cancer. My connection is very personal, like his, and it&#8217;s just kind of crazy to me that a lot of the data we need to fight it lives in silos, which is an artifact from the days when the world was less connected and data was stored in large data warehouses on premises, before the open data movement had picked up steam. We live in the cloud age, and networking things together is creating so much value for the world, but it&#8217;s just not happening fast enough with data. For example, the U.S. Census has some of the most valuable data available, and it powers businesses like ancestry.com and Zillow, but the U.S. Census partnered with us early on to make their data even more usable, and much more connected. Census CMO Jeff Meisel comes from private industry, and he really cares about serving the public with data in much the same way a CMO in the private sector cares about delivering value to his or her customers. And of course, he wants to know, who is using this data? How are they using it? Part of the goal with Census is to provide them with this visibility, and I think that we&#8217;re creating a framework for public entities, private firms, and individuals to continuously improve the way data is shared and used.  <\/p>\n<p><strong>So you&#8217;re storing all the data, you&#8217;re normalizing across disparate data sets, and then you&#8217;re providing an API to query multiple data sets at once. Is that kind of the idea overall?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s very close. As we ingest datasets from users or from supply partners like Census, we put them into a very large graph database. That allows us to break the data up into what are known as atomic triples, which makes it highly interoperable and joinable. For example, if a user uploads a dataset containing ZIP codes, and another user or data supply partner uploads a dataset containing ZIP codes, you can join the datasets quickly, run queries against it, and share the query and what it returns.  <\/p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s important to note that we&#8217;re not trying to replace every part of the data professional&#8217;s toolchain. We&#8217;re actually building this so it enhances a user&#8217;s existing data work toolchain, making it easy to get data into and out of the platform. So we already preview more than 30 data filetypes, we&#8217;re creating various connectors and integrations, and we&#8217;re not asking you to give up R Studio or any other tool you know and love. <\/p>\n<p><strong>What are the biggest challenges or problems you are running into?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The biggest challenge in building a business like this, versus my previous businesses, like Bazaarvoice, and Coremetrics, is that we have to win in the court of public opinion. We believe that, at scale, there&#8217;s only going to be one primary social network for data people, and we intend to be it. But to get there, you have to win the hearts and minds of the community, and that means you need to be obsessively focused on how a wide range of users use data.world. Anybody from a business analyst working inside a large company, to the data scientist at an NGO who needs advanced capabilities. So the challenge is winning over a very broad spectrum of users, across a very broad spectrum of industries, across a very broad spectrum of countries.<\/p>\n<p>To achieve this, we have our daily metrics standup meetings and interviewing users every week to understand how they&#8217;re using the system and how it has to evolve. It actually takes me back to my days of creating one of the first Internet games in 1990. We were obsessively focused on how players played our game. Of course, players could show up from any country. It was one of the most popular games on the Internet by 1992, this is back in the days of TELNET, pre-HTML. <\/p>\n<p>One of the things I really love about the business is how technical it is. We&#8217;re democratizing the Semantic Web, which is something that Tim Berners Lee has been advocating for a long time. But the truth is, the Semantic Web just hasn&#8217;t taken off yet. The reality is that it&#8217;s used only by the wealthiest few, it&#8217;s used by the NSA, it&#8217;s used by Palantir, it&#8217;s used by Facebook and Google, it&#8217;s used by Goldman Sachs. And it&#8217;s kind of sad that the most powerful data technology to ever come along in human history hasn&#8217;t been democratized. So we&#8217;re very mission-driven, very fired up, and you can read it in our public benefit statement, which of course is public, about what we&#8217;re all about, but it really started up as democratizing the most powerful data technology, for both the average user, as well as the more advanced user.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You&#8217;re well known for a being a strong advocate of Austin. But didn&#8217;t you raise most of the money for this out of California? Does Austin not have a vibrant fundraising scene?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Austin has a vibrant fundraising scene, but there is a limitation in terms of the size of funds. And that&#8217;s going to change over time. Used to not be the case, we used to have one megafund, in Austin Ventures, which could write $15 to 20 million checks, for the right type of bold, ambitious business that data.world is. We don&#8217;t have that type of early-stage funding capability anymore. But we&#8217;re a great city to get started in on the fundraising front. Let&#8217;s say that you&#8217;re doing something that&#8217;s still exciting, but less ambitious. And I&#8217;ve never worked on anything as ambitious as data.world, this is the most ambitious project I&#8217;ve ever worked on. So let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re starting the next Bazaarvoice. We raised $3.8M, and we actually got to cash flow breakeven on the first $2M. The amazing thing about Bazaarvoice is we went from 0 to $100M in sales in 6 years from inception. We only raised $25M in total, and we had $12M of it left in the bank when we went public. So we were incredibly capital efficient as a SaaS business. You know, I was able to raise money in Austin, for Bazaarvoice, that wasn&#8217;t a problem. And I actually raised it from Austin Ventures. And I&#8217;d be able to raise it today, I&#8217;d be able to raise it from LiveOak, Silverton, S3, as well as perhaps a few others. That type of check is not a problem in Austin. I went to Silicon Valley because we&#8217;re in the post-Austin Ventures era, and I really wanted a partner that understood building platform businesses. For all the amazing things that have happened in Austin, entrepreneurially, there aren&#8217;t a lot of big platform businesses in Austin. And I wanted that expertise from the beginning on our board, and I&#8217;m glad to say I found it in California, with Jason Pressman, someone I had actually known for 17 years prior to him joining our Board. And he&#8217;s with a firm named Shasta Ventures. Jason is particularly interesting because he&#8217;s been on the boards at Nextdoor and Smule since the beginning. Nextdoor, as you know is the largest online community for people that live in neighborhoods and own houses. Smule is one of the largest online communities now for people who love music and want to share their music, and I&#8217;m talking about individuals, not artists, but Smule has a lot of interesting functionality where individuals and artists team up and do things on that social network. It&#8217;s a kind of huge social network for music. So Jason has that experience, and they&#8217;re used to backing platform companies. So to be honest, I didn&#8217;t even start in Austin with our fundraise, I went straight to California, and I only spoke with VCs that are used to backing platform businesses. Because I wanted someone who understood exactly what we were going after, and had the capital to back it up. Having said that, I very quickly got Austin money into our company. I got our largest VC in Austin into our company, that&#8217;s LiveOak Venture Partners. And they&#8217;ve been fantastic. I got a lot of individuals in Austin into our company, like John Mackey the co-founder and co-CEO of Whole Foods. Clayton Christopher, who founded DEEP EDDY vodka in town, and a number of others, but it is fair to say that out of the $14M we&#8217;ve raised, I would say, and these are rough numbers, I would say around $10M of it came from California, around $1.5M or so came from Austin. Around $1M came from Chicago, and then the rest came from New York. Now part of the reason for that is that I&#8217;ve got relationships all over. A lot of the people I spoke with I&#8217;ve known for many years. And that&#8217;s as a result of building several businesses that have become global businesses, and I&#8217;ve traveled a lot in my lifetime.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I know that with Bazaarvoice, and I assume before that, you were very deliberate about the culture of the company. What kind of culture are you building with this company?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You know it is a very different culture for a platform business, but I&#8217;d say we&#8217;re being very deliberate about it. And we recently we were honored as one of Austin&#8217;s best places to work by the Austin Business Journal, so it feels good to get an early win like that for such a young company. We&#8217;ve really been able to hire some of the best people that we&#8217;ve ever worked with at companies like Trilogy, Bazaarvoice, HomeAway, Indeed, and others. It&#8217;s really exceptional, the people that we have here, it&#8217;s the best early-stage startup team I&#8217;ve ever been a part of. And that&#8217;s not just the result of my experience, that&#8217;s the result of the fact that I&#8217;ve got three amazing co-founders who are also very accomplished and very well-connected in the Austin area. So the reason I tell you all that is that culture ultimately is a reflection of the foundation and the raw material, which is your people. And we&#8217;ve hired people that were the cultural standard bearers, and the performance bearers, at their previous companies. <\/p>\n<p>But it is a very different type of culture than Bazaarvoice. I would say that Bazaarvoice was a very sales-driven culture. It was a verticalized, B2B SaaS company. The play was to convince the 10,000 or so VPs of e-commerce in the world to join the Bazaarvoice solution, and ultimately buy a fairly expensive enterprise-grade software solution to host something so critical, their customer reviews, which is so effective at driving online sales. There are 700M consumers each month that use Bazaarvoice, they just don&#8217;t know it. Because it&#8217;s like the Intel Inside of clients like Best Buy, Walmart, and others. So if Bazaarvoice is a very sales-driven culture, data.world is a very engineering-driven culture, and if you think about what we&#8217;re doing and building a platform business, it&#8217;s much more technical than the initial solution was at Bazaarvoice. We&#8217;re going after a slightly more technical audience, although we&#8217;re also going to win over and we are winning over the business analysts of the world. And out of the 26 people we have today, 17 of them are in engineering. <\/p>\n<p>One of the ways that we stay focused on our users is through a tremendous amount of communication on Slack. I would say 80% of our communication is on Slack, vs. email, which keeps a very real-time pace. <\/p>\n<p>You always feel connected to pretty much everything occurring in the company, or occurring with our users, because you even see the support channel for example hooked up to Slack. So I personally see every single support request that comes through. Obviously that won&#8217;t scale, but when you&#8217;re in a preview release mode and you have thousands of users, it&#8217;s very important to see what every single person is doing, and stay focused on that and stay very close to, ultimately, the person you&#8217;re trying to win over in that court of public opinion. We have tons of standup meetings, including a daily standup for our executive team, a daily standup for metrics, and every team has their own as well. And then we have lots and lots of user interviews. <\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s different than in the early days of Bazaarvoice. There, when you won a client, whoever won the client would hit a massive gong we had in the office. Everybody would gather around, and it was very tribal, and it was very sales-driven, where that person would talk about how they won that client over and ultimately how excited that client is to launch a very transparent form of communication on their own site. With this business, it&#8217;s much subtler when we win. You&#8217;re winning on an individual user basis, and you&#8217;re winning thousands and thousands of them over. Instead of hitting a gong, we Slack our success and recognize each other during our standups. <\/p>\n<p><strong>You mentioned Slack. What other tools are you finding to be particularly useful?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re also big users of Google Hangouts. We wired up all of our conference rooms with Google Hangouts in the first few weeks of having an office. We also use all the standard tools that you would imagine for this type of company. We&#8217;re obsessed users of GitHub, which obviously is the social network for coders. We manage social with Hootsuite. For our metrics, we use Segment, and Mixpanel, which allow us to see user behavior at an aggregate level, and really understand exactly how people use the platform, so we can constantly rev the technology. We&#8217;re running multiple experiments simultaneously with tools like Optimizely.<\/p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t have a phone system. I mean there is no general phone number that people call into. Being a platform type of business, all of our communication with users is digital with the one exception of when we do user tests and we get on Google Hangouts and then we can see each other and see what they&#8217;re doing, or we have them into the office in person.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So why did you decide you wanted to be a CEO again?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, there were two reasons. One I talked about earlier, which is the impact of the Henry Crown fellowship on me. I had been backing entrepreneurs pretty heavily over a 3-year period after Bazaarvoice, and I really enjoyed that. And I still back entrepreneurs, and I invest in one startup once every 2 to 3 months right now. But I was investing at a much, much faster pace for that 3 years. When I joined the Henry Crown fellowship, it got me thinking in a very meditative way about my age, and whether I was doing the best I could to improve the world, in the way that I know. What I know is how to create innovative technologies that benefit a lot of people. <\/p>\n<p>One really cool thing to think about with Bazaarvoice is that, yes, we had 10,000 VPs of e-commerce to reach, but ultimately we were helping hundreds of millions of consumers get transparent information about products. When we started Bazaarvoice, 11 years ago, there were only 3 retailers in the entire United States who had customer reviews on their site, which is kind of crazy to think about. Amazon, back then, was only around 4% of US online retail sales. <\/p>\n<p>A lot has changed in 11 years, but the other thing that had a big impact on me was my family. I thought that the most important thing that I could do over that 3-year period is be Super Dad. So I was at every field trip, I would constantly be on call with my wife, kind of Super Husband as well, and was just extremely present for things. I also learned this very important lesson from my parents, which is involve your kids with your business, because if you&#8217;re not doing something you&#8217;re passionate about in business, why the hell are you doing it? If you involve your kids in it, they ultimately will see that their parents are doing something that they really care about, and they&#8217;ll pick up some lessons along the way, without you explicitly trying to teach them. During those three years, I involved our daughter in quite a few of these meetings with entrepreneurs, as well as startup competitions I was judging. And sometimes she would make the decision of whether or not we actually invested. Especially if it was a product where I thought she&#8217;s going to understand this better than we&#8217;re going to understand this as adults. She&#8217;s going to know if this product will win in the marketplace. And that was very empowering to her, and really I think helped her in a lot of ways with her development. But it&#8217;s interesting, because during the act of being Super Dad and Super Husband, Rachel turns to me one day, and she says, &#8220;Dad, when are you going to start another business?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Well Rachel, look at what I&#8217;m doing, look at how many entrepreneurs I&#8217;m helping. Look at the different startup competitions we&#8217;re going to,&#8221; etc. And she said, &#8220;Yeah, yeah Dad, all that&#8217;s great. When are you going to start another business?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It really kind of took me back. I didn&#8217;t know what to say. And I had to think about it for several days. And then it hit me, when she was growing up, I started Bazaarvoice when she was 6 months old, and I would bring her into Bazaarvoice, and I was very passionate about what Bazaarvoice was doing from the beginning, and I would bring her into client summits, I would bring her into all-hands meetings, I would bring her into different things in the company at Bazaarvoice, and she was a part of it. And it hit me that, and of course she would tell her friends what her dad did, and they would say, &#8220;Oh yeah we use customer reviews.&#8221; I realized that it was the best example that I could be as a parent. <\/p>\n<p>Abraham Lincoln has this really beautiful quote, which goes something like: &#8220;If you would like your child to walk in a certain direction, you yourself must walk in that direction.&#8221; I started to think at that point that the best thing I could do is go back into the arena, and hopefully have an even bigger impact on society. And data.world is set up that way, where once we&#8217;re successful, we&#8217;ll totally transform the way people work with data. We&#8217;ll totally transform that problem of the data janitorial work, and Rachel and our son, Levi, years from now, will ask, &#8220;What was the world like before data.world? You actually had to go find the data in some university site and then it wasn&#8217;t documented? And then you had all these problems with it? That you needed to clean up before you could even do analysis? That doesn\u2019t make any sense.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t make any sense, but that is the way the world of data is today. It&#8217;s still highly, highly-siloed. I have a lot of energy around solving that problem, and I have a lot of energy around working with my co-founders. Our COO, Matt Laessig, is just an amazing person. We first met in grad school. We told each other then that we&#8217;d start a business together, and here we are many years later doing it. He&#8217;s one of the best leaders I&#8217;ve ever worked with, and he&#8217;s also a great family person and individual. He&#8217;s been on American Ninja Warrior for the last 7 years, and one of the only people I went to grad school with who has gotten into progressively better shape ever since we graduated. Jon Loyens is our Chief Product Officer, and he&#8217;s incredible. Not only is he the best engineering leader I&#8217;ve ever worked with, but he also has been in his own band for 15 years. He&#8217;s played with Melissa Etheridge and all types of people. He serves on the Board of Directors of the Andy Roddick Foundation, which works for underserved communities in Austin, especially children. Bryon Jacob, our CTO, was at HomeAway for the last 10 years, and one of the smartest technologists I&#8217;ve ever worked with. We&#8217;ve become very, very good friends. I get a lot of energy from being part of a team on such an ambitious and impactful mission.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Final question: Why a blue owl for the logo?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a geeky reason and a non-geeky reason. So let me start with the non-geeky reason. An owl in many cultures, represents knowledge and wisdom. And data.world is clearly going to accelerate that on a global scale. The geeky reason is that it&#8217;s a nod to Tim Berners-Lee original version of the Semantic Web, the most powerful data technology to ever come along and not yet be fully realized. And the ontology language for the Semantic Web is called Web Ontology Language, but the acronym for it, strangely enough, is OWL. The query language for the semantic web is called SPARQL, it&#8217;s a WC3 standard. So we named the owl Sparkle. Everyone in the company has their own Sparkle-tar, which represents something uniquely individual about them. Of course, Matt Laessig&#8217;s is the Ninja Sparkle, and Joh Loyens&#8217;s is The Guitarist Sparkle. We have a lot of fun with it.

Horrible word I know, but it keeps appearing in corporate circles, generally in the context of what companies want to achieve with all that data they are producing, or which is now available to them from external sources\u00a0\u2014 social media and so on. As per a conference I was recently at, the conclusion frequently reached is that monetisation of data \u2014 that is, making money from it \u2014 is\u00a0becoming a high-priority goal for any business.<\/p>\n<p>Why \u2018monetisation\u2019? Is it just that it is a nicer word than \u2018profiteering\u2019? Or possibly because it sounds slightly like the ultimate goal presented by Maslow\u2019s pyramid of needs, \u2018self-actualisation\u2019? Although\u00a0the former deserves scrutiny (which will be the subject for another day),\u00a0I\u2019m mostly with the latter. The fact is that organisations know they can do better if they use information better, and doing better primarily means either making more or losing less money.<\/p>\n<p>So, yes, monetisation it is. For some industries, turning data into so-called \u2018business value\u2019 is nothing new \u2014 anything to do with finance, for a start. Accounting, for all its complexity, is ultimately about managing tables of figures and their relationships; banks are purveyors of mathematical transactions. Healthcare, engineering and other scientific disciplines also have a substantial data element. Retail supply chains\u00a0have long been\u00a0driven by data, as are manufacturing systems and utilities plants.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s changed the game for all companies (which is why all businesses are \u2018going digital\u2019) is that customer-related data has engulfed business strategy, at the same time as all other data sources proliferating. Marketing used to be a relatively isolated set of activities, feeding the other parts of the business on a regular basis with information and potentially sales leads. Today however, such information has become incredibly accessible, so it appears, with customer expectations changing equally quickly.<\/p>\n<p>And meanwhile, in principle at least, you can now know exactly how a business is functioning to the n\u2019th degree, second by second. Through a myriad of sensors,\u00a0via\u00a0a multitude of sources you can check everything from the humidity levels in a container crossing the ocean to the stress levels on a paving slab. Nobody really knows how much data is enough, so the response can be to keep adding to the pile of sensors. From a client I have heard of an tendency to plan the right number of sensors in advance, but this is emerging best practice.<\/p>\n<p>The result of all this data, both external and internal, is that many companies have ended up paralysed. Even senior corporate strategists flounder like a dwarves in Smaug\u2019s cave, arms already laden with the gold nuggets of information they see before them but unable to do much more than grab handfuls of it at a time. The opportunity is tantalising; meanwhile other, slicker organisations simply wade in with buckets and take what they want. What an opportunity, what audacity!<\/p>\n<p>Is it any wonder, then, that consulting firms and computer companies are promoting solutions to this challenge? In honesty, not that they really have a solution to the challenge as a whole. For all the machine learning and information management frameworks, the open APIs, agile delivery and DevOps strategies, nobody has a magic sieve that can separate useful data from the shrapnel. Instead, such advice usually turns to scoping \u2014 what beneficial goal are you trying to achieve and what specific information you need to do so.<\/p>\n<p>Monetisation is therefore a shorthand term for not wanting the opposite, i.e. not wanting to remain in a state of uncertainty where everyone and their dog seem to be having an easier time of making sense of it all, and potentially cashing in, than you are. The valuations of some of the digitally enabled startups may be vastly inflated, but who wouldn\u2019t want some of that? Find me a company that says, \u201cNo, sir, please don\u2019t give me that vastly inflated valuation.\u201d But just as not all singers are destined to be pop stars, the majority of companies need to set more realistic goals.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a further irony. Money is itself just a form of data, a (frequently poor) measure of value of anything, derived to simplify exchanges of goods and services. The fact we have worked out how to exchange the measure itself (as illustrated by currency) is an indicator of how complicated this can get. In other words, even if an organisation successfully achieves \u2018monetisation\u2019, it will have managed to convert a partial representation of reality into an arbitrary estimate of what that might be worth.<\/p>\n<p>If that sounds vague, it\u2019s because it is. The real trouble with the monetisation of data isn\u2019t that the idea is grubby. It\u2019s that it takes companies away from the things they have been able to understand, their products and services, and heads them en masse towards a cave where all that glitters is not gold. It may well be a necessary step for companies to consider how they can get more value out of their data, just as they are looking at services (another horrible word \u2014 \u2018serviceisation\u2019).

Now, more than fifty years\u2019 since the publication of the Roald Dahl classic, we\u2019re on the brink of innovations that might make twentieth-century fiction look more like a forecasting engine. As the way we cook, eat and interact with our food is evolving, what does the future eating look like? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Let\u2019s start in the kitchen<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Many an embroidered wall-hanging will tell you that the kitchen is the heart of the home. Today, that heart holds many possibilities for innovation, some of which are already in play. There are a growing number of smart refrigerators on the market, offering touch-screen, wi-fi enabled doors\u2014yes, you can watch cat videos but you can also view how many eggs you have stocked while you\u2019re at the market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Similarly, wi-fi oven ranges are making it possible to adjust oven temperatures from afar and check if you left your burners on after you left the house. The connectivity plays out in a few different ways; some appliances will connect to your smartphone, but many are hooking up with smart home systems or digital assistants (see <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/products\/whirlpool-smart-front-control-range\/preview\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Whirlpool and Nest<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.geekwire.com\/2016\/general-electric-connects-appliances-amazon-alexa-virtual-assistant-enable-voice-controls\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">GE and Alexa<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) and yet others plug into their own smart home systems (see Samsung\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/samsungs-smart-kitchen-puts-us-one-step-closer-to-automated-dinner\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Smartthings Hub<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But if you\u2019re not ready to invest in new built-in appliances, there are other entry points to smarter cooking. <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/home\/cuciniale-ai-kitchen\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cuciniale<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, for example, promises to deliver perfectly cooked meats by connecting your steak to your smartphone through its multisensor probe. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/03\/25\/june-oven-cooks-up-22-5-million-in-series-a-delays-ship-date-to-add-improvements\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">June Intelligent Oven<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> also works with sensors to improve timing and preparation, but can also recognize what food it\u2019s cooking. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These (as well as the bigger appliances) have the appeal of ease and convenience and may also elevate our cooking skills much in the same way digital has improved our photography. (Think of \u201cseared\u201d as a filter you can simply tap to apply to your tuna.) <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Those holding out for a fully hands-off solution might find projects like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/10\/06\/moley-takes-to-seedrs-to-crowdfund-future-kitchens-with-robotic-chef-arms\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">UK startup Moley Robotics<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2019 robotic kitchen of interest. Moley offers a pair of wall-embedded arms that can prepare and cook your meals. (No indication if it also does dishes.) Meanwhile, thanks to artificial intelligence, robots are learning how to cook the same way many humans are picking up tips: through <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2015\/01\/02\/robots-can-now-learn-to-cook-just-like-you-do-by-watching-youtube-videos\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Youtube<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. It\u2019s all quite compelling, though, for now at least, it\u2019s still more convenient to just order a pizza. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What about the actual food?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A more savory aspect of the future of food is, naturally, the food itself. One fairly easy trend to identify is the move toward a more health-conscious eating\u2014there are plenty of studies to support this but you really only need to see that McDonald\u2019s sells apple slices for confirmation. Technology is ready to enable this trend, with <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.psfk.com\/2016\/10\/count-calories-by-taking-picture-of-food.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">apps<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> that offer calorie counts on pictures of food and devices like <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.smithsonianmag.com\/innovation\/test-your-restaurant-meal-allergens-two-minutes-180956529\/?no-ist\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nima<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> that scan food for gluten and other allergens. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In a way that mirrors the fragmenting of media experiences, we\u2019re also moving toward an era of more customized meals. That\u2019s not simply Ethan-won\u2019t-eat-zucchini-so-make-him-a-hot-dog-customization, but rather food that is developed to mirror our specific preferences, adjust to allergies and even address specific nutritional deficiencies. Success here relies on access to dietary insights, be it through logged historical eating patterns, blood levels and\/or gut microbiome data. (<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">New York Magazine <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">has an <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/nymag.com\/scienceofus\/2015\/10\/future-of-dieting-is-personalized-algorithms.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">interesting piece<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> on the use of microbiome data to create your own personal food algorithm.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And while it&#8217;s easy to imagine more personalized diets at home, we can count on technology to support that same customized approach while we&#8217;re eating out. Increasingly restaurants like Chili&#8217;s, Applebee&#8217;s, Olive Garden and Buffalo Wild Wings are introducing the<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/t.yesware.com\/tt\/a1822417bfbb27c3f0799bfc699d53309da33585\/f71a7e1bcf63a86b111cddfe3d3a3d1a\/9db709d7a13559cf9d705be1d4405496\/insights.samsung.com\/2015\/06\/29\/tableside-tablets-how-tablets-in-restaurants-can-personalize-the-dining-experience\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">table side tablet<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to increase efficiency and accuracy in orders and payments. As restaurant-goers take more control in <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">how<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> food is ordered, it will be easy to expect more customization in <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">what <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">is ordered. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Are we redefining food?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Given the rise of allergies and food intolerance, it\u2019s not difficult to imagine a world of highly-customized eating. More unexpected in the evolution of eating is the work being done in <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.eater.com\/2015\/10\/19\/9553471\/what-is-neurogastronomy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">neurogastronomy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. This is a field that is approaching flavor from a neural level\u2014actually rewiring the brain to change our perception of taste. In other words, neurogastronomy could make a rice cake register as delicious as ice cream cake. By fundamentally changing the types of food from which we derive pleasure, neurogastronomy could essentially trick us into healthier eating. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Then there is the emerging camp that eschews eating in favor of more efficient food alternatives. Products like provocatively-named <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.soylent.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Soylent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and the much-humbler-sounding <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/superbodyfuel.com\/shop\/schmilk\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Schmilk<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> offer a minimalist approach to nutrition (underscored by minimalist packaging), sort of like Marie Kondo for your diet. While this level of efficiency may have appeal in today\u2019s cult of busy-ness, there something bittersweet about stripping food to the bare nutritional essentials, like eliminating the art of conversation in favor of plain, cold communication. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another entry from the takes-some-time-to-get-used-to department comes from a team of Danish researchers. With the goal of addressing the costly challenge of food storage in space, <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/cool-tech\/cosmocrops-3d-printing\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CosmoCrops<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is working on a way to 3D-print food. There are already a number of products available that offer 3D-printed food (check out this <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/3d-printed-food-2016-4\/#natural-machines-which-designed-foodini-is-based-in-barcelona-and-consumers-in-more-than-80-countries-have-expressed-interest-in-the-device-12\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Business Insider<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> article<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> for some cool food sculptures), but CosmoCrops is unique in its aim to reduce storage needs by printing food from bacteria. To that end, they are developing a \u2018super-bacterium\u2019 that can survive in space. (What could possibly go wrong?)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Where is the opportunity?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It\u2019s probably too soon to tell if we\u2019ll be more likely to nosh on bacteria burgers or pop nutritional powder pills come 2050. What is easier to digest today is the fact that connectivity is coming to eating. For the home kitchen, it won\u2019t happen immediately\u2014the turnover for built-in appliances isn\u2019t as quick as, say, televisions and costs are still high. This means there\u2019s still time for the contenders, both the appliance builders and the smart technology providers, to figure out which features will tip the kitchen in their favor. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">From a dietary perspective, there is an opportunity in bridging the gap between our diet and technology. Restaurants will want to explore how to use technology to support more customized food preferences, but the broader question may be what will make it possible\u2014and acceptable, in terms of privacy\u2014to analyze personal data in order to develop meals that align with our unique food preferences as well as our specific nutritional needs? Maybe it\u2019s a wearable that links your gut bacteria to ingredients stocked in the fridge, a toothbrush that reads your saliva, or (to really close the loop) the diagnostic toilet. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With innovation happening on many tracks, the possibilities for our future cooking and eating are both broad and captivating. What will lunch look like in next fifty, twenty, or even ten years? To borrow from Willy Wonka (who actually borrowed from Oscar Wilde):\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThe suspense is terrible.

We revel in our mastery over our domain as we tap on smart phones to change the heat in our home, see who&#8217;s at the front door or remotely start our car on a snowy morning. Connectivity makes our lives easier, and more enjoyable. There is a dark side though to all of this connectedness, if we can control these devices then it&#8217;s possible others can as well. Last Friday we saw a harbinger of what can be achieved with Internet of Things (IoT) devices that are poorly designed. At one point Dyn reported 10s of millions of IoT device IP addresses that were sending them huge volumes of bogus network traffic. Dyn is one of the root Name Servers on the Internet. This congestion effectively slowed access to a crawl for east coast US users of Amazon, Twitter, Github, Reddit, and many other popular sites.<\/p>\n<p>The compromised IoT devices all appear to be built using the Swiss Army knife of Embedded Linux, BusyBox, and as such might not be readily patchable. Most of these IoT devices are webcams, smart DVRs, and home routers, but they are just the tip of the 1.2 million device iceberg that is the Mirai Botnet. To put this number in perspective the current active duty strength of the US Armed Forces is nearly the same number, 1.28 million. Image all of our active duty military sitting at keyboards running programs to attack a single website, that&#8217;s the power that &#8220;Anna_Senpai&#8221; the single person behind Mirai wields. Now by contrast Mirai isn&#8217;t the largest BOTnet we&#8217;ve ever seen, others like Conficker or Cutwall were larger, but this is the first one built entirely of IoT devices.<\/p>\n<p>So how can we cut Mirai off at the knees? Well it&#8217;s actually pretty simple, create a unique userid and password on all your IoT devices. All the devices in Mirai were hijacked because the owners of these devices never changed the product&#8217;s default userid or password. If you&#8217;re still running with the defaults on your home router, and other IoT devices, please change them now. You may be a slave to Mirai, and not even know it.<\/p>\n<p>What if you&#8217;re the next target for Mirai, how can you defend yourself? Turns out Dyn wasn&#8217;t the first victim, a month earlier Mirai was used to attack Brian Krebs, noted cyber security blogger. Brian Krebs had recently published an article on a company that sold DDoS as a service. At its peak the DDoS assault against his Blog reached 620 Gigabits\/second, effectively silencing Krebs for a short time. When attackers are this diverse the most effective solution is often to distribute the attack load across numerous devices and deploy special hardware filtering in silicon at the edge that is designed to mitigate these attacks. In Brian Krebs case he moved over to Google&#8217;s &#8220;Project Shield&#8221; a platform designed to host journalists who otherwise might be silenced by DDoS attacks.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/Russell_Stern-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"russell_stern\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-951214\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/Russell_Stern-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/Russell_Stern-85x85.jpg 85w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/Russell_Stern-50x50.jpg 50w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/Russell_Stern-180x180.jpg 180w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/Russell_Stern-140x140.jpg 140w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/Russell_Stern-48x48.jpg 48w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/Russell_Stern-25x25.jpg 25w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/Russell_Stern-320x320.jpg 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/Russell_Stern.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>Russell Stern has served as President and CEO at Solarflare Communications since 2004.

Sponsors like VISA induced teams to compete for their prizes by incorporating their APIs and technologies into innovative projects.<\/p>\n<p>My team (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hackathon.io\/eats1\">EATS<\/a>) set out to change the way people dine out by making it a more delightful experience from check-in with the host to ordering from a visual app menu to settling the tab with Ingenico\u2019s mPOS card reader. We weren&#8217;t selected as a finalist, but I was impressed with the state of technologies, the ease with which they could be integrated into products or services and what smart minds could program in 24 hours of focused coding activity. It was also fun to be on a team and build a product, thanks Tim and Jason.<\/p>\n<p>The hackathon winner was <strong>Clever<\/strong>, featuring Amazon Alexa:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Clever is a personal voice-enabled assistant that uses Alexa to help merchants answer the most important questions about their business. We solve the pain of too much data and not enough insight &#8211; all in less than 30 seconds! For example, merchants can ask Clever for: 1. Reporting on your top selling and spending categories 2. A summary of your business performance vs. historical data 3. Recommendations for offers that can benefit your business Clever uses transaction-level sales data and aggregates that merge into top categories to give merchants an idea of where their costs are coming from. Using this historical data, we create a mapping and ranking for relevant credit card and promotional offers that would save money for the merchants. Clever can even use existing information to pre-populate credit card applications. By creating a seamless end-to-end experience, Clever helps merchants to manage their business intuitively by speaking to Alexa, freeing up more time for them to run their business.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>My favorite pick from the hackathon was <strong>Warren<\/strong>, they leveraged both Amazon Echo and IBM Watson&#8217;s AI sentiment tool:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Warren is your very own personal investment advisor. Every day, Warren will prepare a short update for you on how your portfolio is doing and identify ways you can make smarter investments. Warren connects to various sources of information including Facebook for social data, Mint.com for financial data, Xignite for market news, and Robinhood for ticker data. Warren crunches the numbers and uses IBM&#8217;s Watson to analyze sentiment about the company to give real-time, accurate, and personalized investment advice. Warren makes heavy use of the Visa Direct API to connect financial institutions enabling users to move money between their accounts.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Another finalist made a neat app that incentivizes kids to practice music through intelligent microtransactions that keep track of how much they practice as well as how well they play. Each practice session rewards the student for good practicing, trying to inspire him or her to make consistent progress.<\/p>\n<p>The general conference kicked off with a series of quick 20-minute moderated keynote sessions from big players like Alipay (can you say 450 million users and $14.3 billion processed payments on a single day in 2015), Google, Square, and PayPal (announcing integration with Facebook messenger).<\/p>\n<p>The conference also held a startup pitch conference called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.money2020.com\/startuppitch180\">StartupPitch180<\/a> featuring a batch of early stage and late stage companies. <\/p>\n<p>There are a dizzying array of companies competing in this large market but as a consumer, I just want one preferred payment method that consistently rewards me in a personally meaningful way (with both discount on purchases and cashback). From the merchant\u2019s perspective, they want frictionless commerce for the highest conversion rates and of course, they want the lowest possible fees.<\/p>\n<p>There were lots of other exciting discussions on Blockchain technologies and how companies like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chain.com\">Chain<\/a> can securely transfer assets. Additionally, there many sessions and vendors addressing risk security and fraud.<\/p>\n<p>It is an exciting time to see all these technologies collide and I&#8217;m optimistic that many multi-billion businesses will be built. After all, VISA handles a mere $7 trillion dollars of annual global charges alone! And as JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon indicated in the recent annual report, &#8220;Silicon Valley is coming. There are hundreds of startups with a lot of brains and money working on various alternatives to traditional banking.&#8221;<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/hehman-headshot-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"hehman-headshot\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-951210\" srcset=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/hehman-headshot-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/hehman-headshot-768x1152.jpg 768w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/hehman-headshot-453x680.jpg 453w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/hehman-headshot-968x1452.jpg 968w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/hehman-headshot-93x140.jpg 93w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/hehman-headshot-1000x1500.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/hehman-headshot-17x25.jpg 17w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/hehman-headshot-33x50.jpg 33w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/hehman-headshot-300x450.jpg 300w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/hehman-headshot-320x480.jpg 320w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/hehman-headshot-640x960.jpg 640w, https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2016\/10\/hehman-headshot-804x1206.jpg 804w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" \/>David Hehman, Chairman, Spartina, Inc.<\/p>\n<p>David Hehman is a lifetime entrepreneur and an active early stage technology investor.

It has its pros and cons, but if it means poorer quality of the final product and increasing risk of data loss, then it&#8217;s not the way to go.<\/p>\n<h2>Bad behavior<\/h2>\n<p>I stumbled on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/sysadmin\/comments\/57m2xo\/the_maxta_disaster_a_cautionary_tale_of\/\" target=\"_blank\">this article which talks about all the problems, bugs and mistakes made by Maxta with one of its (now former) customers<\/a>. I won&#8217;t talk about Maxta and this particular case (also because there are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theregister.co.uk\/2016\/10\/18\/maxta_moneyback_row\/\" target=\"_blank\">different versions of this story<\/a>), but this is an example on how some vendors, especially small startups, are setting the bar too high and then consequently struggle to deliver.<\/p>\n<p>Data loss is the worst case scenario, but it&#8217;s quite common now to hear about storage startups in trouble when the game gets tough. Sometimes they miserably fail to scale when they promise &#8220;unlimited scalability&#8221;, or performance is far lower than expected or some of the features don&#8217;t actually work as documented. <\/p>\n<p>This time round it&#8217;s happened to Maxta, but I&#8217;m sure that many others could fall in the same mistake.<\/p>\n<h2>DevOp-izing Data storage is dangerous<\/h2>\n<p>n the last couple of years, I&#8217;ve been hearing a lot about the drastic change in the development process of storage systems. Most of the vendors are adopting new agile development processes, and some of them have been openly talking about a DevOps-like approach.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve always been keen on this type of development approach:  modern, fast and produces results quickly. But&#8230; I can appreciate it on my smartphone apps, not on my storage system. I can imagine a continuous refinement of the UI or management features, but not for core performance or data protection aspects of the product.<\/p>\n<p>What ever happened to the golden rule &#8220;if it works, leave it alone!&#8221;??? I&#8217;m not saying to apply it literally, but couldn&#8217;t more time be spent on testing and QAs instead of releasing a new version every other week? Do we really need a storage software update every fortnight?  I don&#8217;t think so.<\/p>\n<h2>Fierce competition<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s all about  competition in the end. In the past a single good feature was enough to make a product, set a new market and have success (take DataDomain for example). It took time for others to follow and the development cycle was not as fast as today.  Now everything is much more complicated, things have accelerated and an on going product evolution is needed to keep the pace with your competitors. Look at hyperconvergence or All-Flash for example, in many cases it is really difficult to find a differentiator now, and end users want all the features that are taken for granted (and the list is very long!). What is now considered table stake is already hard to achieve, on top of which you have to promise more to be taken seriously.<\/p>\n<h2>Closing the circle<\/h2>\n<p>I know times have changed and everything runs at a faster pace\u2026 but when it comes to data and data storage, data protection, availability and durability are still at the top of the list, aren&#8217;t they?<\/p>\n<p>Standing out in a crowd is much harder now than in the past. Even established vendors are much quicker in reacting to market changes. Lately, when a new potential market segment is discovered, they&#8217;ve shown their ability to buy out a startup or come out with their own product pretty quickly and successfully (take <a href=\"http:\/\/www.juku.it\/en\/vmware-vsan-when-good-enough-becomes-very-good\/\" target=\"_blank\">VMWARE VSAN<\/a> for example). First movers, like Nutanix for example, have an advantage (a vision) and can aim at successful exits, but for a large part of the me-too startups it&#8217;s tough because the lack of innovation and differentiation puts them in an awkward position: they are constantly trying to catch up with the leaders.<\/p>\n<p>Software-defined or not, product quality is still fundamental, especially when dealing with Storage. I&#8217;d like to see more storage vendors talk about how thoroughly they test their products and how long they maintain them in Beta before going into production\u2026 instead of how many new releases they are able to provide per month! <\/p>\n<p>And please, find some time to write better documentation too!<\/p>\n<p><i>&gt;Originally posted on <a href=\"http:\/\/juku.it\" target=\"_blank\">Juku.it<\/a><\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Storage is becoming less conservative than in the past.

In this post, I explore a number of the study\u2019s findings that focused closely on the wants, needs, and concerns of Millennials and the workplace.<br \/>\nOne of the major findings of the Future Workforce Study was that Millennials attitudes toward technology in the workplace are quite different than other cohorts. It turns out that Millennials are about 10% more tech-oriented and collaborative than the norm. But that\u2019s just the starting point.<\/p>\n<h3>The Research<\/h3>\n<p>Penn Schoen Berland, on behalf of Dell and Intel, conducted 3801 online interviews across nine international markets between April 05 and May 03, 2016.

They are more inclined to believe that face-to-face interaction will become obsolete &#8212; a finding that I disagree with in part, because it is contradicted in other studies where Millennials have expressed a higher than average desire for f2f meetings over other forms, for example. Nonetheless, these findings collectively show a strong lean forward toward adopting future technologies. (And I wonder if we will see an additional 10% difference with Gen Z workers, just starting to join the workforce? Or will they head in a different direction?)<\/p>\n<p>The rightmost comparison in the chart above shows a sizeable minority of Millennials would consider quitting a job if the technology was below their idea of acceptable, again, at a rate of 10% above the baseline.

in this research strong evidence for the notion that Millennials\u2019 attitudes toward technology are more positive across the board, and that they believe in the promise of future technology to increase collaboration, make it easier to do their jobs, and decrease the reliance on face-to-face interactions. <\/p>\n<p>Therefore, companies &#8212; and their leaders &#8212; have an implicit need to support the technological hunger of Millennials. We\u2019ve seen in several of the findings from this study more explicit implications for leadership. Specifically this: to attract and retain the best and brightest Millennials, companies will have to make better than average investment in new technologies\u2026 or else. Clearly, Millennials will reject companies that fall short in this area.<\/p>\n<p>We shouldn\u2019t forget the other workers, like the over 35 year-olds. While they are somewhat less over the top about new technologies, large numbers still want higher levels of productivity, collaboration, and smarter workplaces.<br \/>\nSo management must find ways to push the level of technology so that all the cadres of the workforce &#8212; Millennials and non-Millennials alike &#8212; \u00a0benefit from workplaces that are smarter, more collaborative, and more productive, for all involved.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Recent research undertaken by Dell and Intel explored a wide range of issues regarding the changing landscape of the modern workplace.

I struggled a bit to understand what it was and how it worked, but if I&#8217;m right\u2026 this is another attempt from VMware to be more relevant in the cloud and, at the same time, it looks like another major validation for AWS.<\/p>\n<h2>VMware wants to be cloudier<\/h2>\n<p>Long story short, VMware is not perceived as a cloud player, so by associating their name with AWS they want to change that. Technically speaking they did a great job by bringing  all the ESXi-based products and management suites on the AWS infrastructure. All the VMware experience as is, on the cloud.. WOW!!!  There is no cross platform compatibility though,  you&#8217;ll just have your VMware environment running next to an AWS region.  And close, means less latency and easier data mobility too, which could be another benefit from the TCO point of view.<\/p>\n<p>From the end user standpoint  this is great, and should be a significant benefit. You can have your services on-premises and on the cloud without touching a line of code or an application or even a process and it can be managed by the same sysadmins&#8230; while having access to the next generation services and APIs provided by Amazon AWS for your cloud-based applications.<\/p>\n<p>The price component could be a deterrent, but it&#8217;s also true that VMware will take care of everything under the hood (including ESX\/vSphere patching, etc.), you just have to manage your VMs, networks (NSX is an option) and applications. Slick and neat!<\/p>\n<h2>Strategy and tactic<\/h2>\n<p>The beauty of this service is also the real risk for VMware &#8211; in the long term at least. By adopting this service the end user has the easiest path to access AWS from its VMware environment.  There is no real compatibility between the two, but moving services and applications will become easier over time\u2026 and it&#8217;s supported by VMware.<\/p>\n<p>The end user is now free to choose the best strategy for the smoothest path without limitations or constraints. After all, nothing was added to VMware in terms of services, APIs or anything else,  it&#8217;s just the classic VMware infrastructure moved to the cloud as is. Easy and great from the tactical point of view, but in the long run they&#8217;ll just be helping AWS do more business\u2026<\/p>\n<h2>This is yet another gateway to AWS<\/h2>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I like this VMW on AWS thing\u2026 but it really looks like another gateway to better AWS consumption.  If your core applications reside on a VMWARE-based infrastructure you are just moving them closer to AWS while removing any latency barrier. Today, the developer will be able to design a new application that accesses your old database stored in VMware VM (which also serves other legacy applications)\u2026 tomorrow that database will be migrated to AWS, and I&#8217;m not so sure you&#8217;ll be needing the old database any longer (hence VMware), will you? This is the worst scenario (for VMware) of course, but I can&#8217;t see many positive outcomes for VMware in the long term. Please share your comments on this if you have a different point of view.<\/p>\n<h2>Closing the circle<\/h2>\n<p>I can see the advantages for both AWS and VMW with this partnership. But in the long term, AWS will most likely benefit the most and be in the better position.<\/p>\n<p>VMW is further validating AWS in the enterprise (was it necessary?), while this could be the first time VMware gets it right with the cloud.<\/p>\n<p>It remains to be seen whether this move will pay off for VMware in the long term&#8230; whether this is the first step towards something bigger that we don&#8217;t know about yet or just a tactical shift to buy some time and try to stay relevant while deciding what to do in a cloudy future\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Other questions arise &#8211;  vCloud air is already dead  but what about vCloud Director? Will VMW on AWS functionalities be ported to  vCloud Director for example? I&#8217;m curious to see the reaction of VMware-based service providers to this news and how their strategy will change now that their competitors are VMW and AWS together!<\/p>\n<p><i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http:\/\/juku.it\" target=\"_blank\">Juku.it<\/a><\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Just a few days before VMWorld, VMWare announced VMWare on AWS partnership.

He asked me what I actually thought about Hyperconvergence and whether, from my point of view, it will become dominant in all types of enterprises\u2026 my  short answer was &#8220;yes and no&#8221;, and here is why. <\/p>\n<p>When you talk with end users the first reason they give for choosing HCI is its simplicity (which also means lower TCO by the way). Generally speaking, HCI solutions are very good at serving &#8220;average&#8221; workloads but when the going gets tough, the tough get going\u2026 and hyperconvergence as we know it, is no longer enough.<\/p>\n<h2>When &#8220;good enough&#8221; is more than enough<\/h2>\n<p>Most modern HCI solutions scale pretty linearly up to a certain extent. By adding additional nodes to the cluster, you get more available resources almost immediately. They are hybrid or all-flash, covering a great number of different workloads,  and internal compute resources are used to manage guest VMs as well as the distribute storage layer. You can&#8217;t ask too much.  Latency consistency and IOPS are not always top, but they are good enough to satisfy the needs of end users.<\/p>\n<p>The beauty of HCI lies in the fact that the SysAdmin can manage all the resources in the cluster from a single interface (usually VMware vCenter) and most of the painful tasks we usually find in traditional storage are simplified or simply non-existent.  In fact, a good VMware Sysadmin can easily become a jack of all trades, and manage the whole infrastructure without too much effort.<\/p>\n<p>When the infrastructure is small or highly virtualized, hyper convergence seems very efficient.

The perfect HCI cannot run all types of workloads while delivering high performance, large capacity and decent TCO.<\/p>\n<p>HCI effectiveness strictly depends on the type of organization, its size and the kind of data and workloads managed. It can be very high in small organizations but decreases quite rapidly in larger ones, and when workloads, or their sum,  have very specific characteristics which stress one particular resource more than others.<\/p>\n<p>In some cases the solution comes form specialized HCI infrastructures. For example, this is somewhat of a stretch but, you can think about an Hadoop cluster as an HCI or, even better, solutions like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hds.com\/en-us\/products-solutions\/converged-infrastructure\/hyper-scale-out-platform.html\" target=\"_blank\">HDS HSP<\/a> (which also add OpenStack-based VM management to its specialized file system and is packaged as a single scale-out appliance).<\/p>\n<p>Another interesting trend, especially when a lot of data is involved, is to leverage smarter storage solutions. Now there are several startups working on <a href=\"\/?p=15128\" target=\"_blank\">AWS-lambda-like<\/a>  functions applied to large storage repositories (usually object storage. i.e. <a href=\"http:\/\/openio.io\" target=\"_blank\">OpenIO<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/noobaa.com\" target=\"_blank\">NooBaa<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/cohodata.com\" target=\"_blank\">Coho Data<\/a> and, of course, Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure ) and others are embedding database engines and interfaces into the storage system (e.g.: <a href=\"http:\/\/iguaz.io\" target=\"_blank\">Iguaz.io<\/a>).  There are plenty of use cases, especially when you think about Big Data analytics or IoT. The idea is to offload specific compute tasks to a specialized data-centric infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>In other circumstances, when consistent low latency is the most important characteristic of the storage system, in-memory storage and I\/O parallelization become more and more interesting. In this space there are several companies working on HW or SW products which leverage large RAM configurations and modern CPUs to achieve unprecedented results. Examples can be found in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.datacore.com\" target=\"_blank\">DataCore<\/a> with its Parallel I\/O technology, <a href=\"http:\/\/diablo-technologies.com\" target=\"_blank\">Diablo Technologies<\/a> with its Memory 1 DIMMs and <a href=\"http:\/\/plexistor.com\" target=\"_blank\">Plexistor<\/a> as well as many others. In this scenario the goal is to bring data closer to the CPU and the application to reduce latency and optimiez network and storage communication.<\/p>\n<h2>Closing the circle<\/h2>\n<p>At the end of the day, Hyperconvergence is still a great solution for all those traditional workloads which don&#8217;t need large capacity storage or low latency. In other cases it becomes less effective and TCO increases rather quickly.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have exact numbers here, but it&#8217;s easy to see that in small enterprises (and highly virtualized environments) HCI is the way to go and it can potentially cover almost 100% of all needs. At the same time, with highly specialized applications accessing large amounts of data, such as for Big Data Analytics, we will need different architectures designed with high efficiency in mind.<\/p>\n<p>HCI vendors are quite  aware of this situation and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see vendors like Nutanix leveraging the technology they acquired from Pernix to improve their products (or build more specialized solutions) and cover a larger number of workloads over time.<\/p>\n<p><i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http:\/\/juku.it\" target=\"_blank\">Juku.it<\/a><\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last week I was on a call with an executive of a large HCI vendor.

He identified six different phases that, if graphed, resembled the letter J. <\/p>\n<p>We caught up with Howard to ask if our readership, mostly enterprise companies, could glean anything from these lessons.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How can the J Curve be relevant in a corporate environment?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As large corporations struggle to remain innovative, you need a tool to facilitate product innovation in an environment that may not be conducive to innovation. The good news is that the J Curve can be exactly the tool you need to overcome the corporate obstacles that stand in your path.<\/p>\n<p>The J Curve predicts exactly what happens in the early stages of innovation and explains why innovation often struggles in larger organizations.  There are specific actions that you can take that can protect innovation, and indeed encourage it.  <\/p>\n<p><strong>How so? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, whether you are a corporate employee or are working with a large organization while still a start-up founder, recognize that the factors affecting your success are different than if you are operating as a small, independent entity. These factors can be both positive and negative, but it\u2019s more likely that they\u2019ll be positive if you are aware of them and are sufficiently agile to shift your approach to take advantage of them. <\/p>\n<p>New projects need strong sponsorship from the leadership. They need to be protected when they are in the delicate phase of trying to figure out exactly what the new product is.  There is a lot of natural uncertainty involved in the messy process of birthing a new product. The team that is spearheading the innovation needs the time and flexibility to make it through what I refer to as \u201cthe long cold winter.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Once they are through that, then larger organizations actually have many advantages over a raw start-up and these advantages need to be leveraged.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Can we include the checklist from your book in the interview?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>By all means. <\/p>\n[The following is excerpted from &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.howardlove.com\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Start-up J Curve<\/em><\/a>&#8220;]\n<ul>\n<li> Is the large organization with which you&#8217;re associated hamstrung by a slow-moving approval process, bureaucracy, and difficulty accepting any type of failure? Are there ways you might incorporate aspects of J Curve to facilitate the speed, flexibility, and innovation that characterize the best start-ups?<\/li>\n<li> In the Create phase, can you form a small team that is insulated and protected from the pressures, bureaucracy, and procedures that can make it difficult to come up with truly innovative products?<\/li>\n<li> In the Release phase, are you able to speed up the process of getting a product out there by either creating a beta product, releasing it under a different brand name, or committing to come out with different versions of it quickly\u2014or doing all three?<\/li>\n<li> In the Morph phase, are you able to overcome the innate organizational resistance to making major, wholesale product changes by having your effort fly under the corporate radar or by operating as a company within a company and not subject to the typical corporate oversight?<\/li>\n<li> In the Model phase, are you able to capitalize on the large organization&#8217;s infrastructure that the company may already have in place?<\/li>\n<li> In the Scale phase, are you taking advantage of the organization&#8217;s people, process, and money resources?

(storage tiers, that is)"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Last week I was at <a href=\"\/?p=15172\" target=\"_blank\">NetApp Insight<\/a> and it was confirmed, not that it was necessary, that S3 protocol is the key to connecting and integrating different storage tiers. You know, I&#8217;ve been talking about the need of a two tier architecture for modern storage infrastructures for a long time now (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.juku.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Juku-Future-of-Storage-Two-Tier-Strategy-Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here a recent paper on the topic<\/a>) and I also have strong opinions about object storage and its advantages.<\/p>\n<h2>The missing link<\/h2>\n<p>The main reasons for having two storage tiers is cost and efficiency. $\/GB and $\/IOPS (or better $\/Latency today) are the most important metrics while, on the other hand, efficiency in terms of local and distributed performance (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.juku.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/DDN-WOS.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">explained here in detail<\/a>) are other fundamental factors.  All the rest is taken for granted.<\/p>\n<p>The challenges come when you have to move data around. In fact, data mobility is a key factor in achieving high levels of efficiency and storage utilization contributing, again, to lower $\/GB. But, primary and secondary storage use different protocols for data access and this makes it quite difficult to have a common and consistent mechanism to move data seamlessly in the front-end.<\/p>\n<p>Some solutions, like <a href=\"http:\/\/cohesity.com\" target=\"_blank\">Cohesity<\/a> for example, are quite good in managing data consolidation and its re-utilization by leveraging data protection mechanisms&#8230; but it means adding additional hardware and software to your infrastructure, which is not always possible either because of cost or complexity.<\/p>\n<h2>S3 to the rescue<\/h2>\n<p>It seems several vendors are finally discovering the power of object storage and the simplicity of RESTful-based APIs. In fact, the list of primary storage systems adopting S3 to move (cold) data to on-premises object stores or to the public cloud is quickly growing.<\/p>\n<p>Tintri and Tegile have recently joined Solidfire and DDN in coming up with some interesting solutions in this space, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theregister.co.uk\/2016\/09\/30\/netapp_previewing_onprem_storage_to_cloud_tiering\/\" target=\"_blank\">NetApp previewed its Fabric Pools at Insight<\/a>. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve left someone out,  but it should give you an idea of what is happening.<\/p>\n<p>The protocol of choice is always the same (S3) for multiple and obvious reasons, while the object store in the back-end can be on-premises or on the public cloud.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to this approach the infrastructure remains simple, with your primary storage serving front-end applications while internal schedulers and specific APIs are devoted to supporting automated &#8220;to-the-cloud&#8221; tiering mechanisms. It&#8217;s as easy as it sounds!<\/p>\n<p>Depending on each specific implementation, S3 allows to off-load old snapshots and clones from primary storage, make a copy of data volumes in the cloud for backup or DR, automated tiering, and so on.  We are just at the beginning, and the number of possible applications is very high.<\/p>\n<h2>Closing the circle<\/h2>\n<p>It is pretty much clear that we are going to see more and more object-based back-ends for all sorts of storage infrastructures with the object store serving all secondary needs, no matter where the data comes from. And in this case we are not talking about Hyper-scale customers!<\/p>\n<p>In the SME it will primarily be cloud storage, even though many object storage vendors are refocusing their efforts to offer options to this kind of customer: the list is long but I can mention <a href=\"https:\/\/s3.scality.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Scality with its S3 Server<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/openio.io\" target=\"_blank\">OpenIO with it&#8217;s incredible easy of use<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/noobaa.com\" target=\"_blank\">NooBaa with its clever &#8220;shadow storage&#8221; approach<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.juku.it\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/WP-CEPH_final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Ceph and many others<\/a>. All of them have the ability to start small, with decent performance, and grow quickly when needed. Freemium license tiers (or open source versions of the products) are available, easing the installation on cheap (maybe old and used) x86 servers and minimizing adoption risks.<\/p>\n<p>In large enterprises object storage is now part of most private cloud initiatives, but it is also seen as a stand-alone convenient storage system for many different applications (backup, sync&amp;share, big data archives, remote NAS consolidation, etc).<\/p>\n<p><i>Originally posted on <a href=\"http:\/\/juku.it\" target=\"_blank\">Juku.it<\/a><\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last week I was at NetApp Insight and it was confirmed, not that it was necessary, that S3 protocol is the key&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":43891028,"featured_media":951085,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[39170592,133339,359216381],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951084"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/43891028"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=951084"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951084\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/951085"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=951084"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=951084"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=951084"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":951058,"date":"2016-10-13T15:27:35","date_gmt":"2016-10-13T20:27:35","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=951058"},"modified":"2016-10-13T15:27:35","modified_gmt":"2016-10-13T20:27:35","slug":"appian","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/10\/13\/appian\/","title":{"rendered":"Is iBPMS the Secret Ingredient for Agile Digital Transformation?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Enterprises that are in the throes of digital transformation are quickly beginning to realize that agility has become a key factor for success.

Calkins added \u201cThe goal with Appian Quick Apps is to keep users from getting bogged in specifying granular actions when building the core app while maintaining customizability.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Calkins isn\u2019t alone in his observations, both<a href=\"http:\/\/www.appian.com\/resources\/the-forrester-wave-bpm-platforms-for-digital-business-q4-2015\/\"> Forrester<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.appian.com\/resources\/gartner-magic-quadrant-ibpms\/\">Gartner<\/a>, well known research houses, agree with Calkins assessments, offering that BPM tied with agility is the key for digital transformation success. However, there is a lot more to the story of low-code &amp; no-code solutions than drag and drop simplicity. It all comes down to the creativity that such a development environment can deliver.<\/p>\n<p>Calkins added \u201cLow-Code Platforms free up software developers from mundane tasks like adding fields to forms or testing mobile apps so they can do more of what they love: creating and inventing.\u201d Capabilities that bring experimentation and agility to the forefront of BPM. Interestingly, BPM has become a bit of a misnomer in this arena, as low-code platforms can do much more than just automate business processes, something that adopters are starting realize.<\/p>\n<p>Case in point is operational advantages that major wireless carrier Sprint-Nextel discovered by entrusting their digital transformation to low code ideologies. Sprint-Nextel was able to quickly rework how they deploy and manage their growing wireless network. The company turned to an ideology of deploying some 70,000 \u201cmini-macros\u201d, small amplifiers to boost coverage. Which proved to be a complex legal, regulatory, technological and overall program management endeavor.<\/p>\n<p>In the past, provisioning something along the lines of a new cell tower could take up to 30 days, simply because of inefficiencies found in process and data management. Sprint switched to a BPM solution, more specifically an iBPMS (intelligent business process management suite) to improve and accelerate the 8,000 business processes involved in provisioning a new cell site. Thanks to a low-code, no-code ideology built into the iBPMS, Sprint was able to reduce data collection, analysis and reporting times from 30 days to 7 days, with a solution that they were able to deploy in just 3 weeks.<\/p>\n<p>Sprint isn\u2019t alone in the race to innovation, countless other organizations are turning to iBPMS to realize the agility needed today for successful digital transformation. One such organization is Sanofi, the 4<sup>th<\/sup> largest pharmaceutical company in the world. Sanofi\u2019s goal was to achieve faster clinical trial start-ups, a key competitive advantage for getting new drugs to market. Sanofi approached the ideology of digital transformation by looking at ways to automate the numerous steps involved for getting a clinical trial started.<\/p>\n<p>Adopting an iBPMS solution that leveraged a low code approach enabled Sanofi to reduce clinical trial startup times from six months to just two months. What\u2019s more Sanofi was able to reduce exposure to risk, by making sure every procedural step met the strict filing deadlines for compliance with regional governing bodies.<\/p>\n<p>While Sprint and Sanofi prove the value of iBPMS with low code methodologies, the applicability of iBPMS is much broader. Most any organization can benefit from the agility provided by low-code solutions, agility that is magnified when coupled with BPM. It is that realization that makes iBPMS the secret sauce for digital transformation, simply by liftng the constraints of high-code environments and manual tasks and transforming process creation into something akin to plug and play simplicity. After all, organizations are better served by their developers focusing on logic and not the particular nuances of a complex development environment.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>intelligent Business Process Management Suites are the future of agility <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8020068,"featured_media":950686,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[43860,51757,359218029,359256601,200311],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951058"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8020068"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=951058"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951058\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/950686"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=951058"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=951058"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=951058"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":951012,"date":"2016-10-07T08:00:03","date_gmt":"2016-10-07T13:00:03","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=951012"},"modified":"2016-10-04T14:06:29","modified_gmt":"2016-10-04T19:06:29","slug":"the-future-of-immersive-environments-virtual-home-design-backcasting-the-future-and-a-look-at-how-vrar-get-social","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/10\/07\/the-future-of-immersive-environments-virtual-home-design-backcasting-the-future-and-a-look-at-how-vrar-get-social\/","title":{"rendered":"The Future of Immersive Environments: Virtual Home Design, \u201cBackcasting\u201d the Future and a Look at How VR\/AR Get Social"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><em>At the <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/change\/\"><em>Gigaom Change<\/em><\/a><em> conference in Austin, Texas, on September 21-23, 2016, <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/alltheseworldsllc.com\/company\/\"><em>Dr. Jacquelyn Ford Morie<\/em><\/a><em> (CEO of All These Worlds), <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.thebdx.com\/about-bdx\/management-team\/melissa-morman\"><em>Melissa Morman<\/em><\/a><em> (Experience Officer at BDX), <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dell.com\/learn\/us\/en\/uscorp1\/secure\/liam-quinn\"><em>Liam Quinn<\/em><\/a><em> (CTO of <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.dell.com\/\"><em>Dell<\/em><\/a><em>), and <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/art.utexas.edu\/about\/people\/doreen-lorenzo\"><em>Doreen Lorenzo<\/em><\/a><em> (Director of <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/finearts.utexas.edu\/center-integrated-design\"><em>UT Austin\u2019s Center for Integrated Design<\/em><\/a><em>) talked about empathetic design in virtual space and the future of augmented reality.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The future is already here, but there is much more to come in terms of more fully immersive environments. Virtual and augmented reality (VR\/AR) will proliferate in digital spaces, taking us from a two-dimensional interface to three-dimensional virtual spaces. But once these virtual and augmented environments are ubiquitous, what will we do, how will we react and what new things will we learn?<\/p>\n<p>One of the areas where we\u2019ll see some of the biggest changes is the home.<\/p>\n<p>Melissa Morman, Client Experience Officer at BDX, is looking at ways homebuilders can adopt and deliver more digital experiences for their customers. Mormon said she is scouting new technologies for the homebuilding industry by asking questions like, \u201cHow do you attract customers digitally?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Currently, prospective homeowners are given floorplans to help them evaluate (and visualize) a new home. But when the home isn\u2019t built or significant changes are being made, floor plans can\u2019t do the job. Smart builders understand this and are looking at ways of using virtual and augmented reality tools to help clients see the possibilities.<\/p>\n<p>Donning an Oculus Rift headset, customers are digitally immersed into the virtual home and are able to make adjustments to colors, materials and even the physical configurations of the rooms. Need to make a hallway wider for wheelchair access? Want to see what your countertop looks like with another color of granite? All of these changes can be visualized in great detail.<\/p>\n<p>Once inside these immersive environments, how might we react though? What will our emotional responses be and how can those be used in creative ways?<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Jacqueline Ford Morie said that &#8220;VR let&#8217;s you experience walking a thousand miles in someone else&#8217;s shoes. It&#8217;s powerful as a tool for empathy.\u201d She cited a project called \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wvXPP_0Ofzc\">Hunger in LA<\/a>\u201d which recasts the participant in a reconstructed scene of a real-life man who has collapsed in line at a food bank. This project was ground-breaking as a journalistic approach to creating empathy and understanding.<\/p>\n<p>The panel moderator and director of the UT Austin Center for Integrated Design, Doreen Lorenzo, agreed that there is a huge opportunity for designers to use VR and AR to \u201cstep inside\u201d the world of the user and really understand what they need \u2014 whether you\u2019re designing for someone with disabilities or understanding the specific needs of a group. Morie agreed, saying, \u201dWe\u2019re starting to use a lot of VR for health reasons so it can be life-changing. That\u2019s coming.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But this is all a single-person experience. The perception of VR is that it\u2019s anti-social. Can we expect to see social, virtual experiences?<\/p>\n<p>Morie mentioned a project called Placeholder as a great example of some of the earliest social VR work ever done (the project is led by <em>Computers as Theater<\/em> author and researcher, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Brenda_Laurel\">Brenda Laurel<\/a><u>)<\/u>. Filling the role of different spirit animals, you and a group of your friends can talk to one another and leave each other messages in the larger scope of the game. There are also opportunities to have richer, more immersive experiences \u2014 diving under the water as fish or soaring in the clouds as a bird. \u201cVR is social, not anti-social,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>If VR is temporary immersive experiences, then AR is always with us. We can imagine this as constantly accessible informational overlays. Imagine a mechanic working on a part with a virtual manual right in front of them. But further in the future, AR has the potential to go beyond simple overlays. In a world that merges AR and VR, they\u2019ll create a mixed reality (MR) that is seamless and fluid.<\/p>\n<p><u><br \/>\n<\/u>Quinn said they were already starting to see aspects of this vision with Dell\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=p2kiIqkQZVQ\">Smart Desk<\/a> for creative professionals. Dell is developing business applications for augmented reality that will allow IT departments do things like remote technical support with augmented overlays. They\u2019re also working with automotive and airline partners to create mixed reality environments for their customers, creating ever-richer experiences for engage.<\/p>\n<p>By Royal Frasier, Gryphon Agency for Gigaom Change2016<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At the Gigaom Change conference in Austin, Texas, on September 21-23, 2016, Dr. Jacquelyn Ford Morie (CEO of All These Worlds), Melissa&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87877924,"featured_media":951018,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[359219847,188247,359256596,18949],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951012"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87877924"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=951012"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951012\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/951018"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=951012"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=951012"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=951012"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":951010,"date":"2016-10-06T08:00:56","date_gmt":"2016-10-06T13:00:56","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=951010"},"modified":"2016-10-04T13:57:55","modified_gmt":"2016-10-04T18:57:55","slug":"enchanting-products-and-spaces-by-rethinking-the-human-machine-interface","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/10\/06\/enchanting-products-and-spaces-by-rethinking-the-human-machine-interface\/","title":{"rendered":"Enchanting Products and Spaces by Rethinking the Human-Machine Interface"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><em>At the <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/change\/\"><em>Gigaom Change<\/em><\/a><em> conference in Austin, Texas, on September 21-23, 2016, <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/davidloringrose\"><em>David Rose<\/em><\/a><em> (CEO of Ditto Labs, MIT Media Lab Researcher and author of <\/em>Enchanted Objects<em>), <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.argodesign.com\/mark-rolston-bio.html\"><em>Mark Rolston<\/em><\/a><em> (Founder and Chief Creative Officer at <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.argodesign.com\/\"><em>argodesign<\/em><\/a><em>) and <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/change\/speakers\/rohit-prasad\/\"><em>Rohit Prasad<\/em><\/a><em> (Vice President and Head Scientist, Alexa Machine Learning) spoke with moderator, <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/change\/speakers\/leanne-seeto\/\"><em>Leanne Seeto<\/em><\/a><em>, about \u201cenchanted\u201d products, the power of voice-enabled interactions and the evolution of our digital selves.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s so much real estate around us for creating engaging interfaces. We don&#8217;t need to be confined to devices. Or at least that is the belief of Gigaom Change panelists, David Rose, Rohit Prasad and Mark Rolston, who talked about the ideas and work being explored today that will change the future of human-machine interfaces creating more enchanted objects in our lives.<\/p>\n<p>With the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) and advances in voice recognition, touch and gesture-based computing, we are going to see new types of interfaces that look less like futuristic robots and more like the things we interact with daily.<\/p>\n<p>Today we\u2019re seeing this happen the most in our homes, now dubbed the \u201csmart home.\u201d Window drapes that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aOCLDaUVCm0\">automatically close<\/a> to give us privacy when we need it is just one example of how our homes and even our workspaces will soon come alive with what Rose and Rolston think of as Smart-Dumb Things (SDT). One example might be an umbrella that can accurately tell you if or when it\u2019s going to rain. In the near future devices will emerge out of our phones and onto our walls, furniture and products. We may even see these devices added to our bodies. This supports the new thinking that devices and our interactions with them can be a simpler, more seamless and natural experience.<\/p>\n<p>Rose gave an example from a collaboration he did with the architecture firm Gensler for the offices of Salesforce. He calls it a \u201cconversational balance table.\u201d It\u2019s a device that helps subtly notify people who are speaking too much during meetings. \u201cBoth introverts and extraverts have good ideas. What typically happens, though, is that during the course of a meeting, extraverts take over the conversation, often not knowingly,\u201d Rose explains, \u201cso we designed a table with a microphone array around the edge that identifies who is speaking. There\u2019s a constellation of LEDs embedded underneath the veneer so as people speak, LEDs illuminate in front of where you are. Over the course of 10 or 15 minutes you can see graphically who is dominating the conversation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So what about voice? Will we be able to talk to these devices too? VP and Head Scientist behind Amazon Alexa, <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/change\/speakers\/rohit-prasad\/\">Rohit Prasad<\/a>, is working on vastly improving voice interactions with devices. Prasad believes voice will be the key feature in the IoT revolution that is happening today. Voice will allow us to access these new devices within our homes and offices more efficiently. As advances in speech recognition continue, voice technology will become more accurate and able to quickly understand our meaning and context.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon is hoping to spur even faster advances in voice from the developer community through Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) and Alexa Voice Service (AVS), which allow developers to build voice-enabled products and devices using the same voice service that powers Alexa. All of this raises important questions. How far does this go? When does voice endow an object with the attributes of personhood? That is, when does an object become an \u201cenchanted\u201d object?<\/p>\n<p>At some point, as Mark Rolston of argodesign has observed, users are changed in the process of interacting with these objects and spaces. Rolston believes that our digital selves will evolve into entities of their own \u2014 what he calls our <u>\u201cmeta me,\u201d <\/u>a combination of both the real and the digital you. In the future Rolston sees our individual meta me\u2019s as being more than just data, but actually negotiating, transacting, organizing, and speaking on our behalf.<\/p>\n<p>And while this is an interesting new concept for our personal identity, what is most interesting is using all of this information and knowledge to get decision support on who we are and what we want. The ability for these cognitive, connected applications to help us make decisions in our life is huge. What we\u2019re moving toward is creating always-there digital companions to help with our everyday needs. Imagine the future when AI starts to act as you, making the same decisions you would make.<\/p>\n<p>As this future unfolds, we\u2019re going to begin to act more like nodes in a network than simply users. We\u2019ll have our own role in asking questions of the devices and objects around us, telling them to shut off, turn on, or help us with tasks; gesturing or touching them to initiate some new action. We\u2019ll still call upon our smartphones and personal computers, but we won\u2019t be as tethered to them as our primary interfaces.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ll begin to call on these enchanted devices, using them for specific tasks or even in concert together. When you ask Amazon\u2019s Echo a simple question like \u201cwhat\u2019s for lunch?\u201d you won\u2019t be read a lengthy menu from your favorite restaurant. Instead, your phone will vibrate letting you know it has the menu pulled up for you to scroll through and decide what to eat. Like the talking candlestick and teapot in <em>Beauty and The Beast<\/em>, IoT is going to awaken a new group of smart, interconnected devices that will forever change how we interact with our world.<\/p>\n<p>By Royal Frasier, Gryphon Agency for Gigaom Change 2016<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At the Gigaom Change conference in Austin, Texas, on September 21-23, 2016, David Rose (CEO of Ditto Labs, MIT Media Lab Researcher&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87877924,"featured_media":951011,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[153122,359256595,359223201,198082223,359221305],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951010"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87877924"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=951010"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951010\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/951011"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=951010"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=951010"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=951010"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":951008,"date":"2016-10-05T08:00:46","date_gmt":"2016-10-05T13:00:46","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=951008"},"modified":"2016-10-04T13:42:29","modified_gmt":"2016-10-04T18:42:29","slug":"artificial-intelligence-its-not-man-vs-machine-its-man-and-machine","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/10\/05\/artificial-intelligence-its-not-man-vs-machine-its-man-and-machine\/","title":{"rendered":"Artificial Intelligence: It&#8217;s Not Man vs. Machine.

Each of the panelists agreed that as we enter into the next digital frontier, AI will be woven into each of these areas causing a \u201csuper-convergence\u201d of capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>Saxena predicts that \u201cthis age of the Internet is going to look small by comparison to what&#8217;s happening in AI.&#8221; It\u2019s true. The proliferation of AI creates a new world of application and computation design, including embodied cognition in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jC0I08qt5VU\">concierge-style robots<\/a> that help when we need assistance.<\/p>\n<p>Cloud will become \u201ccognitive cloud,\u201d a ubiquitous virtual data repository powered by a \u201cdigital brain\u201d that understands human needs to help us engage with information seamlessly in work and life. Big data will evolve from being about understanding trends to understanding and predicting outcomes. In combination these developments will disrupt enterprise IT and other business models across the world.<\/p>\n<p>But as we move from a \u201cmobile first to an AI first\u201d landscape, how do we differentiate the winners from the losers? And how can investors know where to place their bets?<\/p>\n<p>Trust and transparency are going to be the two most critical pieces of winning applications. Imagine a hedge fund manager using AI algorithms to develop a financial strategy for their portfolio. Before placing millions of dollars at risk, that manager will need an explanation of why the AI chose a particular solution.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re seeing companies like Waze do this already. Beyond being a great way to navigate, Waze is a contextually aware, predictive computing platform that anticipates what information you need next based on your location and route. More applications in different industries \u2014 from healthcare, to retail, to personal finance \u2014 will <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/07\/11\/manoj-saxena-talks-artificial-intelligence-with-gigaom\/\">soon act like Waze<\/a>, using cognitive computing and context to constantly learn and anticipate what we need.<\/p>\n<p>The businesses that will win are the ones that apply AI capabilities not just to automate their processes, but that use AI to run their business in a fundamentally different way.<\/p>\n<p>First, we have to understand the areas that AI can best be applied. The challenge in cognitive computing is interpreting and understanding the oftentimes imprecise language we use as humans. As High pointed out in the panel, \u201cour true meaning is often hidden in our context.\u201d AI needs to be able to learn from these conditions to gain meaning.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not a question of who has the best technology, but who has the best understanding and appreciation of what the technology can unlock. The people who will gain the most from AI are the ones who are rethinking their business processes, not just running their existing businesses better.<\/p>\n<p>As more of our lives are aided by intelligent systems in our homes, at work, and in our cars, other questions arise. Will AI get so smart that it replaces us? Sutton, High and Saxena all agree \u201cno,\u201d but they say that some tasks will certainly become automated. They believe the more important change will be the creation of a new class of jobs. According to Forrester, <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.forrester.com\/jp_gownder\/15-08-24-robots_wont_steal_all_the_jobs_but_theyll_transform_the_way_we_work\">25% of all job tasks<\/a> will be offloaded to software robots, physical robots, or customer self-service automation \u2014 in other words, all of us will be impacted in some way. But while that may sound disparaging, the same study states that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cio.com\/article\/2984910\/hiring\/are-robots-really-going-to-steal-your-job.html\">13.6 million jobs will be created<\/a> using AI tools over the next decade.<\/p>\n<p>The nature of work will change dramatically with AI. We\u2019ll have technology that augments our skills and abilities \u2014 perhaps something like a \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/ironman.wikia.com\/wiki\/J.A.R.V.I.S.\">JARVIS suit<\/a>\u201d that allows us to be superhuman. We\u2019ll work alongside robotic colleagues that help us with our most challenging tasks. In terms of cognitive computing, we\u2019re talking about amplifying human cognition, not replacing the human mind. There is so much to be gained when we uncover ideas and solutions we wouldn\u2019t have been able to do on our own.<\/p>\n<p>Today 2.5 exabytes of data are being produced every day. That number is expected to grow to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.computerweekly.com\/news\/2240217788\/Data-set-to-grow-10-fold-by-2020-as-internet-of-things-takes-off\">44 zettabytes a day by 2020<\/a>. Like an actual brain \u2014 a super-complex network of biological components that learns and grows with experience \u2014 these interconnected data points, along with the machine learning algorithms that learn and act upon them on our behalf, are the building blocks of our AI-powered future.<\/p>\n<p>By Royal Frasier, Gryphon Agency for Gigaom Change 2016<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At the Gigaom Change conference in Austin, Texas, on September 21-23, 2016, Manoj Saxena (Chairman of CognitiveScale), Josh Sutton (Head of Data&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87877924,"featured_media":951009,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[20169528,12374,359216542,359226200],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951008"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87877924"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=951008"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/951008\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/951009"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=951008"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=951008"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=951008"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":950479,"date":"2016-10-04T09:22:10","date_gmt":"2016-10-04T14:22:10","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=950479"},"modified":"2016-10-04T09:22:10","modified_gmt":"2016-10-04T14:22:10","slug":"the-future-of-retail-will-need-people-and-this-blog-post-shows-why","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/10\/04\/the-future-of-retail-will-need-people-and-this-blog-post-shows-why\/","title":{"rendered":"The future of retail will need people, and this blog post shows why"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CotswoldOutdoor\">Cotswold Outdoor<\/a> is a hiking and outdoor retailer based in the UK. It also happens to be the place of work for a\u00a0sales assistant, who goes by the name of Big Dave, and who went\u00a0beyond the call of duty for a blind customer and his helper. You can read about it yourself &#8211; it&#8217;s on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/notes\/cotswold-outdoor-keswick\/the-nicest-person-you-could-wish-to-meet\/1065509120261709\">Facebook page<\/a> for the\u00a0store.<\/p>\n<p>Now, sure, we all love a good story with a happy ending. But this goes deeper, particularly when we consider the tribulations retail has been facing over recent years. Going beyond the\u00a0call of duty might be precisely what enables\u00a0some stores &#8211; certainly those who differentiate on service rather than margins &#8211; to survive. Deeper still, it goes to the heart of questions about the\u00a0nature of work and whether many jobs, in particular customer service jobs, will be automated out of existence.<\/p>\n<p>On this latter point, the\u00a0prevailing mood is currently pessimistic &#8211; a fact which led me to jot down ten\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/03\/23\/10-reasons-why-nobody-is-going-to-be-out-of-a-job-in-the-digital-world\/\">reasons<\/a> why nobody would be out of a job. That post\u00a0spawned some great comments, notably from Kirby who argued the opposite. I believe, however, that Kirby missed the underlying point to the ten reasons. Simply put, it&#8217;s that we help each other because we are programmed to do so as a race, and we are also programmed to expect something in return. Money simplifies this but doesn&#8217;t change it.<\/p>\n<p>Since I wrote the post I have been speaking to industry expert Vinnie Mirchandi, who has been spending considerable time cataloguing jobs and looking at the impact of automation for, and who has been kind enough to send me a review draft of the\u00a0resulting <a href=\"http:\/\/dealarchitect.typepad.com\/deal_architect\/2016\/07\/next-book-silicon-collar.html\">book<\/a>. I have yet to read it all but if I could capture the conclusion in a two\u00a0words it would be <em>expect augmentation<\/em> &#8211; as Vinnie says, &#8220;The end result is an optimistic read on the changing nature of work, a celebration of outstanding workers, and the machines which are making them even better.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We are descended\u00a0from a heritage of outstanding workers, an ancient truth which has taken\u00a0a bit of a hit since the industrial revolution kicked off the automation game. Work gives us meaning, and makes us feel valued, and we probably couldn&#8217;t stop doing so even if we wanted to &#8211; ask any retiree who ended up volunteering, writing their memoirs or otherwise pursuing a worthy endeavour.<\/p>\n<p>Will work change? Of course it will, and already, profoundly has. Re-skilling will become the norm, rather than the exception. But to suggest we face a future where work is no longer a thing, is to fail to understand what makes us human. And just as we will always have work, so will we always have\u00a0outstanding workers such as Big Dave to celebrate.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cotswold Outdoor is a hiking and outdoor retailer based in the UK.

While we\u2019ve seen a considerable amount of effort to standardise in the platform level, we are still a long way from providing the \u2018giants\u2019 upon which the broader section\u00a0of us lowly creatures can innovate.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s not to understate the considerable effort that has already been made. In the Platform as a Service layer,\u00a0Amazon <a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/iot\/\">AWS IoT<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/internet-of-things\/iot-solutions\/watson-iot-platform\/\">IBM Watson<\/a>\u00a0and Microsoft&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-gb\/cloud-platform\/internet-of-things-azure-iot-suite\">Azure IoT Suite<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zebra.com\/gb\/en.html\">Zebra<\/a>\u00a0and a host of smaller players such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thingworx.com\/platforms\/\">Thingworx<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/evrythng.com\/\">Evrythng<\/a>\u00a0offer massively scalable and open integration, streaming, storage and analytics capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>In industry, the likes of Fujitsu (with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.globeranger.com\/\">GlobeRanger<\/a>) \u00a0and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bosch-si.com\/products\/bosch-iot-suite\/iot-platform\/benefits.html\">Bosch<\/a>\u00a0have things going on; meanwhile\u00a0Intel has an IoT Platform <a href=\"http:\/\/www.intel.com\/content\/www\/us\/en\/internet-of-things\/white-papers\/iot-platform-reference-architecture-paper.html\">reference architecture<\/a> to which a number of vendors have subscribed, including GE with its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.predix.com\/news-events\/featured-stories\/ge-partners-intel-take-industrial-iot-next-level\">Predix<\/a> industrial IoT framework and services. How easy and unfair it is, one might say, to suggest that such efforts are not already substantial.<\/p>\n<p>But while such platforms and standardisation efforts are taking us way beyond where we have been, they are yet to arrive at a point where the real innovation explosion will take place. Solutions are currently domain-specific, frequently proprietary and a long way from the adoption levels seen by, say, social media.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the closest is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.xively.com\/\">Xively<\/a>\u00a0or even <a href=\"https:\/\/ifttt.com\/\">IFTTT<\/a>,\u00a0but none have the immediacy of their social networking.

The challenges currently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.technologyreview.com\/s\/601639\/nests-biggest-problem-wasnt-tony-fadell\/\">faced<\/a> by Nest reflect the \u2018solution without a problem\u2019 stage we are in.<\/p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t a complaint.

Today\u2019s &#8216;advances&#8217;\u00a0will be seen as a world-spanning gestation, a global laying of smart infrastructure upon which the next two decades of innovation will be built.<\/p>\n<p>No user-facing \u2018smart\u2019 portal has been adopted to any extent \u2014 while some (such as <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/09\/12\/fluke-briefing-report-closing-the-gap-between-things-and-reality\/\">Fluke<\/a>) have mentioned a \u2018Facebook of Things\u2019, we are yet to see a billion-user go-to page to access and control our smart devices, either in work or at home.

DB Networks aims to provide the intelligence, analytics and tools to bring insight into the database equation.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s no secret that database intrusions are on the rise, much to the chagrin of those responsible for infosec. \u00a0While many have focused on the notions of protecting the edge of the network and wrapping additional security around user access, the simple fact of the matter is that databases are the primary storehouses of private and sensitive information, and are often the true targets of intruders.<\/p>\n<p>Recent events, such as the Target breach, the theft of security clearance information from the US OPM (Office of Personnel Management) and the theft of medical records from Anthem Healthcare, illustrates that protecting sensitive data is quickly becoming a losing battle. DB Networks is taking steps to turn the tide and bring victory to those charged with protecting databases.<\/p>\n<p>The San Diego based company offers their DBN-6300 appliance and its virtual cousin, the DBN-6300v as founts of database activity, analytics, and discovery to give today\u2019s security professionals an edge in the ever growing cyberattacks that are targeting databases. Those products promise to equip security professionals and database administrators with the tools that can identify and mitigate breaches before irreparable damage is done.<\/p>\n<p>Case in point is the ubiquitous sql injection attack, which is far more common than most will admit to. SQL injection attacks have been around for more than ten years, and security professionals are more than capable of protecting against them. However, according to Neira Jones, the former head of payment security for Barclaycard, some 97 percent of data breaches worldwide are still due to an SQL injection somewhere along the line.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Taking a Closer Look at DBNetworks IDS-6300:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I recently had a chance to put DBNetworks IDS-6300 through its paces at the company\u2019s San Diego Offices. The IDS-6300 is a physical appliance, built on Intel Hardware as a 2U rack mountable server. The device features four 10\/100\/1000 Ethernet Ports for data capture, one 10\/100\/1000 Ethernet admin port and one 10\/100\/1000 Ethernet customer service port, as well as a 480Gb SSD and 2Tb archival storage.<\/p>\n<p>The device can be deployed by plugging it into either a span port or a tap port located at the core switch in front of the database servers. The idea is to place the device, logically ahead of the database servers, yet behind the application servers, so it can focus on SQL traffic. The IDS-6300 is managed via a browser based interface and supports the Chrome, Firefox and Safari browsers and will fully support IE in the near future.<\/p>\n<p>I tested the device in a mock operational environment that included MS-SQL Databases with a demo version of a banking application that incorporated some known vulnerabilities. Setting up the device entailed little more than defining the capture ports and some very basic post installation items. Once configured to capture data, the next step was to identify databases.<\/p>\n<p>Here, the IDS-6300 does an admirable job; it is able to automatically discover any databases that experience any traffic, even simple communications, such as a basic SQL statement. The device monitors for traffic 24\/7 and continually checks for database activity.<\/p>\n<p>That proves to be a critical element in the quest for securing databases \u2013 according to company representatives, many customers have discovered databases that IT was unaware operating in production environments. What\u2019s more, the database discovery capability can be used to identify rogue databases or databases that were never shutdown after a project completed.<\/p>\n<p>The database discovery information offers administrators real insight into what exactly is operating on the network, and what is vulnerable to attack &#8211; knowing that information can be the first step in mitigating security problems, before even venturing into traffic analysis and detection.<\/p>\n<p>Never the less, the product\u2019s real power comes into play when detecting SQL injection attacks. Instead of using caned templates or signatures, the IDS-6300 takes SQL attack detection to the next level \u2013 the device is able to learn what normal traffic is and record\/analyze what that traffic accomplishes, and then builds a behavioral model.<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, the device learns how an application communicates with a database, that information is used to create a behavioral model. Once learning is completed, the device uses multiple detection techniques to validate future SQL statements against expected behavior.\u00a0 In practice, behavioral analysis proves immune to zero day attacks, newly scripted attacks and even old, recycled attacks, because all of those attacks fall out of the norms of expected behavior.<\/p>\n<p>That behavioral analysis eliminates the need for signatures, black lists, white lists and other technologies that rely on pattern matching or static detection, which in turn reduces operational overhead and maintenance chores, almost converting SQL Injection attack monitoring into a plug and play paradigm.<\/p>\n<p>When SQL Injection attacks occur, the IDS-6300 captures all of the traffic and transaction information around that attack. What\u2019s more, the device categorizes, analyzes and presents the critical information about the attack so that administrators (or application engineers) can modify database code or incorporate firewall rules very quickly to remediate the problem.<\/p>\n<p>Which brings up another interesting point, the IDS-6300 proves to be a good candidate for helping organizations improve application code. With many businesses turning to outsourcing and\/or modifying off the shelf\/open source software for application development, situations may arise where due diligence is not fully implemented and agile development projects may lead to introducing security flaws into application code.\u00a0 That is not an uncommon problem,\u00a0 at least according to Forrester Research\u2019s Manatosh Das &#8211;\u00a0 Poor application coding persists despite lessons learned. \u00a0Das claims that more than two-thirds of applications have cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, nearly half fail to validate input strings thoroughly, and nearly one-third can fall foul of SQL injection. Das adds security professionals and software engineers have known about these types of flaws for years, but they continue to show up repeatedly in new software code.<\/p>\n<p>The IDS-6300 will quickly detect those newly introduced flaws and prevent poor programing practices from creating vulnerabilities, and then provide the information that is needed to fix those flaws.<\/p>\n<p>The IDS-6300 offers another advantage to customers; it can help customers to consolidate databases by identifying what databases are active and what they are used for.

Yet, most organizations look upon IT as a necessary evil, one that is both expensive and somewhat obstructionist. However, nothing could be further from the truth, and IT departments the world over have pursued ideologies that highlight the value of the services they offer, while also demonstrating the importance that a properly executed IT management plan brings to the bottom line.<\/p>\n<p>At last weeks <a href=\"http:\/\/www.riverbed.com\/disrupt\/announcement.html?utm_source=ChLi&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=Disrupt\">Riverbed Disrupt<\/a> event, GigaOM had a chance to talk with CIOs, as well as network managers that have demonstrated the value of IT with application performance management platforms and services.<\/p>\n<p>John Green, Chief Information Officer at Baker Donelson, the 64<sup>th<\/sup> largest law firm in the country, offered some real world examples of how Application Performance Management (APM) and end user monitoring bring demonstrable value to an organizations IT department.<\/p>\n<p>Green said \u201cmy staff supports some 275 different applications and more than 40 video conferencing rooms, which are in near constant operation.\u201d Simply put, Green has come to know the importance of how reliable service and end acceptable user experience impacts the view that the firm\u2019s 1,500 employees have of the IT department.<\/p>\n<p>Green said \u201cI was deploying the best technology money could buy, but my end-users still weren\u2019t happy.\u201d Green was looking at a situation where unhappy end users could create dire circumstances, which could impact the firms bottom line. Green added \u201cI could go to management meetings and offer proof that the networks were up 99.9% of the time, and the that the databases and the email servers were delivering five-nine statistics of operation. Yet, my end users were still complaining.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That is when Green had an epiphany, one that amounted to realizing network performance statistics and end user expectations rarely do not go hand in hand. Green said \u201cWe needed the ability to track the actual end-user experience, and then use that information to meet user expectations.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Green found those much desired capabilities with SteelCentral\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.aternity.com\/\">Aternity<\/a>, a product that offers the ability to monitor any application on any device to provide the actual user perspective, at least when it comes to responsiveness and performance. Green said \u201cI have been an Aternity user for about seven years, and it completely transformed the way we relate to our end users.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Green said \u201cAternity is only one part the puzzle, although it provides valuable information, I would like to see the whole performance and experience picture on one pane of glass.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That was a need that brought Green to the Riverbed Disrupt event. Riverbed recently purchased Aternity and is integrating the technology into their SteelCentral product line, looking to give its customers that single pane of glass view.

An observation made abundantly clear at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.riverbed.com\/disrupt\/\" target=\"_blank\">Riverbed\u2019s Disrupt Event<\/a> held in Manhattan last week.\u00a0Overcoming the obstacles of connectivity has become Riverbed\u2019s clarion call, and the company is now offering comprehensive solutions that not only ease the transition to software defined solutions, but also bring much more control and information to the network management realm.<\/p>\n<p>Case in point is the company\u2019s move to products that embrace the ideologies of a Software Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN), such as the company\u2019s SteelConnect 2.0, an application-defined SD-WAN solution.\u00a0In an interview with GigaOM, Joshua Dobies, vice president of product marketing at Riverbed, said \u201cthe new capabilities offered allow branch offices to directly access the cloud, all without having to backhaul everything back to the data center.\u201d\u00a0Dobies added \u201cSD-WAN paves the way for complete digital transformation, allowing enterprises to quickly access the benefits of the cloud, while not discarding their existing investments in Data Center Technologies.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the wholesale movement to the cloud means that technologies must transition to platforms that enable transformation, without incurring disruption. A situation that proves to be the sweet spot for end to end monitoring. With the addition of full network visibility, along with end user experience monitoring, network managers now have the ability to identify connectivity and performance problems on the fly, and can quickly address those problems with policies and tuning.<\/p>\n<p>With the introduction of Riverbed\u2019s next version of its SD-WAN offering,\u00a0SteelConnect 2.0, the company is giving its customers greater visibility throughout the network, thanks to integration with Riverbed&#8217;s SteelCentral, it\u2019s end-to-end performance management platform, and SteelHead products and Riverbed&#8217;s Interceptor offering, which gives SteelConnect greater scale for dealing with larger enterprise deployments.\u00a0Riverbed Chairman and CEO Jerry Kennelly said &#8220;Today, we&#8217;re delivering a software-defined architecture for a software-defined world, and expanding that infrastructure deeper into the cloud and more broadly across all end users.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the new SteelConnect 2.0 release, SteelCentral, it\u2019s end-to-end performance management platform will now incorporate technology from Aternity, which Riverbed acquired in July. Aternity brings the ability to monitor application performance on physical and mobile end-user devices to the SteelCentral product line.

Yet, those looking to place blame may need only look in the mirror. At least that what a survey from cyber security vendor <a href=\"http:\/\/www.beyondtrust.com\/\">BeyondTrust<\/a> is indicating.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.beyondtrust.com\/resources\/white-paper\/privilege-benchmarking-study-2016\/\">BeyondTrust surveyed<\/a> Over 500 senior IT, IS, legal and compliance experts about their privileged access management practices. The survey revealed some interesting trends, some of which should fall under the banner of \u201cthey should know better\u201d. For example, only 14 percent regularly cycle their passwords, meaning that 86 percent of those surveyed are avoiding one of the top best practices for password and credential management. Adding insult to injury, only 3 percent of those surveyed monitor systems in real-time and have the capability to terminate a live session that may be indicative of a breach.<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, the survey indicates that the majority of organizations need to do much more to protect systems from breaches. Many of which, could be easily avoided if the proper policies are put into effect. That said, the survey also revealed that 52 percent of respondents are not doing enough about known risks. In other words, they understand what the risks are, but have not deployed the technologies or crafted the policies to mitigate those risks.<\/p>\n<p>Mitigating those risks should be one of the top jobs of InfoSec today, especially since most of the identified risks can be quickly resolved, using off the shelf products and by just applying best practices. BeyondTrust has developed some recommendations that InfoSec professionals can take to heart to lower risk and harden systems from breaches.<\/p>\n<p>Those recommendations include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be granular: Implement granular least privilege policies to balance security with productivity. Elevate applications, not users.<\/li>\n<li>Know the risk: Use vulnerability assessments to achieve a holistic view of privileged security. Never elevate an application\u2019s privileges without knowing if there are known vulnerabilities.<\/li>\n<li>Augment technology with process: Reinforce enterprise password hygiene with policy and an overall solution. As the first line of defense, establish a policy that requires regular password rotation and centralizes the credential management process.<\/li>\n<li>Take immediate action: Improve real-time monitoring of privileged sessions. Real-time monitoring and termination capabilities are vital to mitigating a data breach as it happens, rather than simply investigating after the incident.<\/li>\n<li>Close the gap: Integrate solutions across deployments to reduce cost and complexity, and improve results. Avoid point products that don\u2019t scale. Look for broad solutions that span multiple environments and integrate with other security systems, leaving fewer gaps.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In an interview with GigaOM, Kevin Hickey, President and CEO at BeyondTrust, offered \u201cCompanies that employ best practices and use practical solutions to restrict access and monitor conditions are far better equipped to handle today\u2019s threat landscape.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hickey added \u201cThe survey proved critical for helping BeyondTrust to better identify threats based upon privilege management, and also helped us evolve our product offerings to make privilege management a much easier process for security professionals.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hickey\u2019s statements were validated by the launch of some new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.beyondtrust.com\/resources\/press-release\/expands-cloud-offerings-with-first-fully-msp-enabled-privileged-access-management-solution\/\">product offerings<\/a>, which are aimed at bringing privilege management ease to those charged with IT security.

What\u2019s more, the uncertainties of transition, driven by potential communications problems, performance issues and incompatibilities could force wholesale, expensive upgrades to support the move to hyper-convergence. An issue many network managers and CIOs would love to avoid.<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, the move towards hyper-convergence, which promises improved efficiencies and reduced operating expenses, can be derailed by the high costs of transitioning to virtualized SANs. An irony worth noting. Never the less, those challenges have not stopped VMware Virtual SAN from becoming the fastest growing hyper-converged solution with over 3,000 customers to date. That said, there is still room for improvement, such as helping VMware Virtual SAN support even more workloads, and that is exactly where vendor <a href=\"http:\/\/www.primarydata.com\">Primary Data<\/a> comes into play.<\/p>\n<p>At VMworld 2016, Primary Data announced the availability of the company\u2019s DataSphere platform, which brings a storage agnostic platform to virtualized environments. In other words, Primary Data is able to tear down storage silos, without actually disrupting the configuration of those silos. It accomplishes that by creating a virtualization platform that is able to mask the individual storage silos and present them as a unified, tiered storage lake, which is driven by policies and offers almost infinite configuration options.<\/p>\n<p>Abstracting data from storage hardware is not a new idea. However, Primary Data goes far beyond what companies such as FalconStore and StoneFly bring to the world of hyper-convergence. \u00a0For example, DataSphere offers a single plane of glass management console, which unifies the management of across the various storage tiers, regardless of the storage type. What\u2019s more, the platform goes beyond the concept of a SLA (Service Level Agreement) and introduces a new concept, aptly abbreviate as SLO (Service Level Objective). Primary Data\u2019s Kaycee Lai, an executive with the company, explained to GigaOM that \u201cSLOs are business objectives for applications. They define a commitment to maintain a particular state of the service in a given period. For example, specific write IOPS, read IOPS, latency, and so forth, to maintain for each application. SLOs are measurable characteristics of the SLA.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Lai added \u201cDataSphere will support DAS, NAS, and Object as storage types. Block level support for SAN will follow in the next release.\u201d One of the key elements offered by the platform is the ability to work with storage tiers, without the disruption of having to rebuild storage silos. Lai added \u201cTiers are a logical concept in DataSphere. Tiers are simply a class of storage that is mapped to a particular SLO. The notion of having multiple tiers is not as important as having multiple objectives requiring the specific storage to meet those objectives. Customers can create as many objectives as their business requires.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the quest to make hyper-convergence common place, Primary Data smooths the bumpy storage path with several abilities, which the company identifies as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adapt to continually changing business objectives with intelligent data mobility.<\/li>\n<li>Scale performance and capacity linearly and limitlessly with unique out-of-band architecture.<\/li>\n<li>Reduce costs through increased resource utilization and simplified operations.<\/li>\n<li>Simplify management through global and automated policies.<\/li>\n<li>Accelerate upgrades of new solutions such as VMware vSphere 6 with seamless migration using existing infrastructure.<\/li>\n<li>Reduce application downtime with automated non-disruptive movement of data.<\/li>\n<li>Deliver a full range of data services across all applications in the data center.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p> there is still room for improvement, such as helping VMware Virtual SAN support even more workloads<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8020068,"featured_media":950776,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[359234104,359217638,128761,359216381],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950916"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8020068"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=950916"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950916\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/950776"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=950916"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=950916"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=950916"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":950862,"date":"2016-09-13T15:00:04","date_gmt":"2016-09-13T20:00:04","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=950862"},"modified":"2016-09-14T14:31:58","modified_gmt":"2016-09-14T19:31:58","slug":"snservice","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/09\/13\/snservice\/","title":{"rendered":"Research Proves that a Customer Centric Approach Can Bring Unforeseen Value"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Service management vendor, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.servicenow.com\/\">ServiceNow<\/a>\u00a0recently\u00a0commissioned <a href=\"http:\/\/www.servicenow.com\/lpwhp\/csm-survey-report-putting-service-first-lessons-from-today-customer-service-leaders.html\">Intergram Research<\/a>\u00a0to conduct a survey, which dispels some of the common myths around service enablement, a realization that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.servicenow.com\/\">ServiceNow<\/a> has long prophesied about.\u00a0In an interview with GigaOM, Holly Simmons, Sr. Director, Global Product Marketing, Customer Service Management, said \u201cthe survey found that the companies that excel at customer service are 127% more likely to enable their customer service agents to enlist the help of different parts of the organization in real-time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Or more simply put, by transforming customer service into a team sport, organization can better meet the needs of their customers, in a much shorter time frame.

Companies identified as top-tier are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>More collaborative. They are more likely to have enabled their customer service agents to engage the help of different parts of the organization when addressing a customer\u2019s problem.<\/li>\n<li>Better problem-solvers. Customer service leaders are also more likely to be able to resolve the root cause of a customer\u2019s problem (a crucial component of closing the resolution gap).<\/li>\n<li>Self-service providers. And finally, these top-tier organizations are more likely to offer self-service options for common requests, freeing them up to focus on more strategic issues.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>While for some, the above may amount too little more than just common sense, the fact of the matter is that many organizations have created silos around their various customer service elements, which hampers collaboration and adds to the time it takes to solve a customer\u2019s problems. What\u2019s more, those silos add hidden expenses to already overtaxed support resources, meaning that the collective knowledge of customer support must be relearned during most any new interaction.<\/p>\n<p>It is those inefficiencies that lead to customers fleeing from specific vendors, especially in the realm of IT. If a customer or client cannot get a quick resolution to a problem, then they may take their business else ware.<\/p>\n<p>Simmons adds \u201cResolving a customer\u2019s issue quickly and effectively requires real-time collaboration, coordination, and accountability among customer service, engineering, operations, field services and other departments. But that\u2019s just not happening at more than half of the companies surveyed. Customer service still sits on an island without a bridge to other departments, partners, and customers. That slows the resolution process, and frustrates both customers and the agents trying to help them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The survey also illustrated the primary problems facing organizations seeking to improve customer service include the difficulty in connecting all service processes, further hampered by service departments being siloed, along with a lack of automation. Those three factors impacted more than 50% of those surveyed, and when viewed as single issues, proved to be a primary barrier to successfully customer service transformation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Call to Action:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While the survey highlights the both the problems and solutions surrounding agile customer service, transformation can only take place if certain ideologies are upheld. According to Servicenow, organizations that treat customer service as a \u201cteam sport\u201d and engage the right people from relevant departments to solve problems are in a better position to proactively address the underlying reasons for customer calls. They also empower their customers to quickly answer their own questions\u2013through self-service portals, knowledge bases, and communities\u2013further reducing the need to interact with customer service agents. The more sophisticated customer service organizations aspire to the ideal of \u201cno-service\u201d by combining these practices to help eliminate the reasons for customer calls in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Customer Service Proves to be an Important Pillar of Business Operations<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8020068,"featured_media":950322,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[105257104,359216638,359228904],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950862"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8020068"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=950862"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950862\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/950322"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=950862"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=950862"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=950862"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":950860,"date":"2016-09-13T13:31:43","date_gmt":"2016-09-13T18:31:43","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=950860"},"modified":"2016-09-13T13:31:43","modified_gmt":"2016-09-13T18:31:43","slug":"announcing-the-full-keynote-panelist-lineup-at-gigaom-change","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/09\/13\/announcing-the-full-keynote-panelist-lineup-at-gigaom-change\/","title":{"rendered":"Announcing the Full Keynote Panelist Lineup at Gigaom Change"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/change\/\">Gigaom Change 2016 Leader&#8217;s Summit<\/a><\/strong> is just one week away, September 21-23 in Austin.

I refer the reader to the vast amount of positive literature that is washing through the blogosphere, no doubt being added to even as I write this. At the same time, plenty of people are pointing out the downsides \u2014 data security for example, more general surveillance issues or indeed the potential for any \u2018smart\u2019 object to be hacked.<\/p>\n<p>All well and good, in other words it\u2019s a typical day in techno-paradise. But the conversation itself is skewed towards the ability to smarten up \u2014 that is, deliver new generations of devices that have wireless sensors built in. What of the other objects that make up 98% (I estimate) of the world that we live in?<\/p>\n<p>Enter companies such as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fluke.com\">Fluke<\/a>, which earned its stripes over many years of delivering measurement kit to engineers and technicians, from multimeters to higher-end stuff such as thermal imaging and vibration testing. While such companies might not have a high profile outside of operational circles, they are recognising the rising tide of connectedness and doing something about it in their own domains.<\/p>\n<p>In Fluke\u2019s case, this means manufacturing plants, construction sites and other places where the term \u2018rugged\u2019 is a need to have, not a nice to have. Such sites have plenty of equipment that can\u2019t simply be replaced with a smarter version, but which nonetheless can benefit substantially from remote measurement and management.<\/p>\n<p>The current consequence, Fluke told me in a recent briefing about their let\u2019s connect-the-world platform (snappily titled the &#8220;3500 FC Series Condition Monitoring System&#8221;), is that failures are captured after the event. \u201cWe have more than 100,000 pieces of equipment and the reliability team can only assess so many.

Today, we hear it from all sorts of tool vendors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>work management tools, like Asana, Wrike, and Trello, built on the bones of task manager with a layer of social communications grafted on top<\/li>\n<li>work media tools, like Yammer, Jive, and the as-yet-unreleased Facebook for Work, build on social networking model, to move communications out of email, they say<\/li>\n<li>and most prominently, the newest wave\u00a0of upstarts, the work chat cadre have arrived, led by Atlassian&#8217;s Hipchat, but most prominently by the mega-unicorn Slack, a company which has such a strong gravitational field that it seems to have sucked\u00a0the entire work technology ecosystem\u00a0into the black hole around its disarmingly simple model of chat rooms and flexible integration.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Has the millennium finally come? Will this newest paradigm for workgroup communications unseat email, the apparently undisruptable but deeply unlovable technology\u00a0at the foundation of much enterprise and consumer communication?<\/p>\n<p>Well, a\u00a0new announcement hit my radar screen today, and I think that we may be at a turning point.\u00a0In the words of\u00a0Winston Churchill, in November 1942 after the Second Battle of El Alamein, when it seemed clear that the WWII allies would push Germany from North Africa,<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And what is this news that suggests\u00a0to me we may be on the downslope in the century-long reign of email?<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft is <a href=\"http:\/\/mspoweruser.com\/microsoft-working-slack-competitor-skype\/\">apparently working on a response to Slack<\/a>, six months after the widely reported <a href=\"http:\/\/mspoweruser.com\/microsoft-reportedly-wanted-buy-slack-8-billion\/\">termination of discussions of acquisition<\/a>. There has been a great deal of speculation about Microsoft&#8217;s efforts in this area, especially considering the now-almost-forgotten acquisition of Yammer (see\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.stoweboyd.com\/post\/25152316448\/why-yammer-deal-makes-sense\">Why Yammer Deal Makes Sense<\/a>, and it did make sense in 2012). However, after that acquisition, Microsoft &#8212; and especially Bill Gates, apparently &#8212; believed they would be better off building Slackish capabilities into an existing Microsoft brand. But, since Yammer is an unloved product inside of the company, now, the plan was to build these capabilities into something that the company has doubled down on. So now we see Slack Teams, coming soon.<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft\u00a0may be criticized for\u00a0maybe attempting to squish too much into the Skype\u00a0wrapper with Skype Teams, but we&#8217;ll have to see how it all works together. It is clear that integrated video conferencing is a key element of where work chat is headed, so Microsoft would have had to come up with that anyway. And Skype certainly has the rest of what is needed for an enterprise work chat platform, and hundreds of millions of email users currently on Exchange and Office 365.<\/p>\n<p>The rest of the details will have to wait for actual hands on inspection (so far, I have had only a few confidential discussions with Microsofties), but an orderly plan for migration away from email-centric work technologies to a work chat-centric model coming from Microsoft means it&#8217;s now mainstream, not a bunch of bi-coastal technoids. This will be rolled out everywhere.<\/p>\n<p>So,\u00a0we are moving into a new territory, a time where work chat tools will become the super dominant workgroup communications platform of the next few decades. This means that the barriers to widespread adoption will have to be resolved, most notably, work chat interoperability.<\/p>\n<p>Most folks don&#8217;t know the history of email well enough to recall that at one time email products did not interconnect: my company email could not send an email to your company email. However, the rise of the internet and creation of international email protocols led to a rapid transition, so that we could stop using Compuserve and AOL to communicate outside the company.<\/p>\n<p>It was that interoperability that led to email&#8217;s dominance in work communications, and similarly, it will take interoperability of work chat to displace it.<\/p>\n<p>In this way, in the not-too-distant future, my company could be using Slack while yours might be using Skype Teams. I could invite you and your team to coordinate work in a chat channel\u00a0I&#8217;ve set up, and you would be able to interact with me and mine.<\/p>\n<p>If the world of work technology is to avoid a\u00a0collapse into a all-encompassing monopoly with Slack at the center of it, we have to imagine interoperability will emerge relatively quickly. Today&#8217;s crude integrations &#8212; where Zapier or IFTTT copy new posts in Hipchat to a corresponding channel in Slack &#8212; will quickly be replaced by protocols that all competitive solutions will offer. And Skype is that irritant that will motivate all these giants to make a small peace around interoperability, in order to be able to play nice with Slack.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll have to see the specifics of Skype Teams, and where Facebook at Work is headed. Likewise, all\u00a0internet giants &#8212; including\u00a0Apple, Google, and Amazon &#8212; seem to be quietly consolidating their market advantages in file sync-and-share, cloud computing, social networks, and mobile devices. Will we see a Twitter for Work, for example, after a Google acquisition? Surely Google Inbox and Google+ aren&#8217;t the last work technologies that Alphabet intends for us? How might Slack fit into Amazon&#8217;s designs? That might surprise a lot of people.<\/p>\n<p>But no matter the specifics, we are certainly on the downslopes of the supremacy of email. We may have to wait an additional 50 years for its\u00a0last gasping breath, but we&#8217;re now clearly in the chat (and work chat) era of human communications, and there&#8217;s no turning back.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Work technology vendors very commonly &#8212; for decades &#8212; have suggested that their shiny brand-new tools will deliver us from the tyranny&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2184122,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[359216601,359215995,359219124,359220610,359215936,40632612,359219474,359216088,359216125,359219650,359256587,359228262,9856226,797071,219122421,359220983],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950811"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2184122"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=950811"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950811\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=950811"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=950811"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=950811"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":950807,"date":"2016-09-06T13:50:45","date_gmt":"2016-09-06T18:50:45","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=950807"},"modified":"2016-09-06T13:50:45","modified_gmt":"2016-09-06T18:50:45","slug":"peak16","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/09\/06\/peak16\/","title":{"rendered":"Is There Life After Dell? SonicWALL Thinks So!"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>When SonicWALL was acquired by Dell back in 2012, many wondered how SonicWALL would fare under the auspices of industry giant Dell. That said, SonicWALL managed to maintain market share in its core SMB business sector, and start making inroads in to the large, distributed enterprise sector. Nonetheless, when Dell decided to sell off its software assets, along with SonicWALL to private equity firms, many began to wonder once again what that meant for SonicWALL.<\/p>\n<p>SonicWALL provided the answers to those queries at the company\u2019s PEAK 2016 event, which was held last week in Las Vegas. The primary topics of discussion focused on applying SonicWALL technology and what the future holds for SonicWall, its partners and customers.<\/p>\n<p>Along with the requisite product announcements, SonicWALL also hosted several educational sessions bringing cloud security to the forefront of partners\u2019 minds, as well as the challenges created by the ever growing IoT infrastructure spreading through enterprises today.<\/p>\n<p>SonicWALL offered a strong message that there is life after Dell, and that the company will thrive and grow despite the forced separation from Dell. For example, SonicWALL is in the process of strengthening the company\u2019s channel programs to better support both its partners and end customers. What\u2019s more, the company also announced its Cloud GMS offering, which is aimed at simplifying management, enhancing reporting, and reducing overhead. What\u2019s more, Cloud GMS brings cloud based management, patching and updating to the company\u2019s army of partners, providing them with a critical weapon in the battle against hosted security vendors, and those plying \u201cfirewalls in the cloud\u201d as a means to an end.<\/p>\n<p>The importance of the forthcoming Cloud Global Management System (GMS) cannot be understated. SonicWALL aims to eliminate the financial, technical support and system maintenance hurdles that are normally associated with traditional firewalls, transforming what was once an isolated security solution into a cloud managed security platform. A capability that will prove important to both customers and partners.<\/p>\n<p>For partners, Cloud GMS brings a unique, comprehensive, low cost monthly subscription to the table, which is prices out based upon the number of firewalls under management. That ideology will allow partners to become something akin to a hosted services security provider, shifting customer expenses to OpEx, instead of CapEx.<\/p>\n<p>SonicWALL Cloud GMS solution Offers:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Governance: Establishes a cohesive approach to security management, reporting and analytics to simplify and unify network security defense programs through automated and correlated workflows to form a fully coordinated security governance, compliance and risk management strategy.<\/li>\n<li>Compliance: Rapidly responds and fulfills specific compliance regulations for regulatory bodies and auditors with automatic PCI, HIPAA and SOX reports, customized by any combination of auditable data.<\/li>\n<li>Risk Management: Provides ability to move fast and drive collaboration and communication across shared security framework, making quick security policy decisions based on time-critical and consolidated information for higher level security efficacy.<\/li>\n<li>Firewall management: MSPs will be able to leverage efficient, centralized management of firewall security policies similar to on-premises GMS features, including customer sub-account creation and increased control of user type and access privilege settings.<\/li>\n<li>Firewall reporting: Real-time and historical, per firewall, and aggregated reporting of firewall security, data and user events will give MSPs greater visibility, control and governance while maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of customer data.<\/li>\n<li>Licensing management: Seamless integration between GMS and MySonicWALL interfaces will allow users to easily and simply log into Hosted GMS to organize user group names and memberships, device group names and memberships, as well as adding and renewing subscriptions and support.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Under the pressures of transition, SonicWALL hosts a successful partner event that highlights what the future holds for the embattled security vendor.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8020068,"featured_media":949984,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[231408,359256425,359217013,801,230038],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950807"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8020068"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=950807"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950807\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/949984"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=950807"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=950807"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=950807"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":950777,"date":"2016-09-05T15:04:53","date_gmt":"2016-09-05T20:04:53","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=950777"},"modified":"2016-09-06T07:51:53","modified_gmt":"2016-09-06T12:51:53","slug":"work-processing-coming-soon-to-a-doc-near-you","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/09\/05\/work-processing-coming-soon-to-a-doc-near-you\/","title":{"rendered":"Work Processing: Coming soon to a \u2018Doc\u2019 near\u00a0you"},"content":{"rendered":"<section class=\" section--body\">\n<div class=\"section-divider layoutSingleColumn\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner layoutSingleColumn\">In June I wrote a piece on what I called \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/06\/08\/work-processing\/\"><strong>work processing<\/strong><\/a>\u2019, where I explored some ideas about the use of new productivity apps, like <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Dropbox Paper<\/strong>, <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Notion.io<\/strong>, or <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Quip<\/strong>, and looking at how these tools that support sharing, co-editing, and commenting of digital \u2018docs\u2019 can form the groundwork for something altogether different from what we used to call \u2018word processing\u2019. In reality, these tools are increasingly being used to manage and share information related to coordinating work. Along with the social communications built-into these tools\u200a\u2014\u200alike commenting, @mentions, and co-editing\u200a\u2014\u200ainclusion of checklists has led to these solutions acting as content-centric work management tools, or \u2018<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">work processing<\/strong>\u2019 tools.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<section class=\" section--body\">\n<div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner layoutSingleColumn\">\n<p class=\"graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">About Work Management<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\">Work management is a term that has become widely used (one that I\u2019ve advocated for some time) which represents the current state-of-the-practice in task management. Task management tools formerly were limited to a list of tasks: tasks with core attributes like due dates, descriptions, notes, attachments, and perhaps subtasks. These were amplified in more recent years with social sharing and communication, so that tasks could be assigned to other people, and comments could used to support basic communicate with team members (\u2019team task management\u2019). Nowadays, the most competitive tools incorporate social communications, like chat, @mentions, and messaging: these I consider <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">work management<\/strong> tools, like <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Asana<\/strong>, <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Trello<\/strong>, and many others. I recently published a Gigaom report on this subject, <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">2016 Work Management Baseline Narrative<\/em><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"graf--figure\"><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-2.medium.com\/max\/800\/0*L3CamZyiD-3CubpK.png\" data-image-id=\"0*L3CamZyiD-3CubpK.png\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"176\" \/><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">(A few) Types of Work Technologies<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">About Work Processing<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\">Using something like Dropbox Paper as a way to share work-related information is quite different than using a work management tool. Instead of putting lists of tasks at the center of the stage, relatively unstructured content\u200a\u2014\u200awritten text, images, tables, videos, audio, and other forms of content\u200a\u2014\u200atakes the central role in information sharing, while tasks are indicated by checklists.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<section class=\" section--body\">\n<div class=\"section-divider layoutSingleColumn\">\n<hr class=\"section-divider\" \/>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner layoutSingleColumn\">\n<blockquote class=\"graf--pullquote\"><p><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pullquote-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--pullquote-em\">Metaphorically, work management is based on the human tendency toward making lists, while work processing relies on our natural urge to tell\u00a0stories.<\/em><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/section>\n<section class=\" section--body\">\n<div class=\"section-divider layoutSingleColumn\">\n<hr class=\"section-divider\" \/>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"section-content\">\n<div class=\"section-inner layoutSingleColumn\">\n<p class=\"graf--p\">Metaphorically, work management is based on the human tendency toward making lists, while work processing relies on our natural urge to tell stories. Or, less romantically, work processing is more like writing in a journal, where occasionally you might add a list of things to do, but where the prose is where the most important information is found.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Using Dropbox Paper as a Work Processing Journal<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\">For several weeks, I have used Dropbox Paper as a work processing journal. This experiment has not involved others, so the social dimension has been limited, but I\u2019ve used Paper with teams in a few projects before, so I can talk to how that might work.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\">At the start, let me say that Dropbox Paper would be way more effective as a work processing solution if checklists were more task-like, and not just one of various sorts of lists, like bulleted or numbered lists. While checklist items can be used to indicate a task, and the checkbox can be checked to indicate being completed, if checklist items only had a bit more of a task model\u200a\u2014\u200awith due dates, assignment, and so on\u200a\u2014\u200aI would be more likely to promote Paper as a foundation for work processing.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\">Adopting the journaling model is straightforward. For each week, I create a new Paper document titled \u2018<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">week &lt;Monday\u2019s date&gt;<\/strong>\u2019, like \u2018<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">week 2016\u201308\u201329<\/strong>\u2032. I define a Paper section to each day of the week, like <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">2016\u201308\u201329<\/strong>, or <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">2016\u201308\u201331<\/strong>. Then, for each day, I write notes and create tasks in one of the three timeframes:<\/p>\n<ol class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf--li\">looking ahead, or prospectively;<\/li>\n<li class=\"graf--li\">in real time, when I working on something alone or with others, as during meetings or on calls; or<\/li>\n<li class=\"graf--li\">looking back, or retrospectively.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p class=\"graf--p\">Here\u2019s a screen capture (edited) of such a week journal:<\/p>\n<figure class=\"graf--figure\"><img class=\"graf-image\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-2.medium.com\/max\/800\/0*-k0I7Db2tP3N3sSY.png\" data-image-id=\"0*-k0I7Db2tP3N3sSY.png\" data-width=\"636\" data-height=\"1264\" \/><\/figure>\n<p class=\"graf--p\">Note the section markers in the left margin, where a click takes the viewer to the appropriate section, in this case, the five days of the workweek.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\">I haven\u2019t displayed Paper comments: any piece of the doc can be selected and a right margin comment can be attached.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\">Collaborators can be @mentioned anywhere, which leads to them being notified. This requires them to be sharing the doc.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\">I started to used #tags in the document, although they aren\u2019t supported yet, but it works for searching already, externally or internally.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\">I also create individual docs for calls and meetings, since they are better shared in that granularity, but I will often retrospectively copy some lines and\/or tasks from such a call\/meeting document back into the week journal, since it serves more as the system of record than individual call\/meeting docs.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Where Dropbox Paper Falls Short in Work Processing<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\">I\u2019ve mentioned the problems with using checklist items as tasks, already, as the major issue with using Dropbox Paper in this way.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\">Other aspects of the experiment worked surprisingly well for me. I thought I\u2019d miss a rich task model\u200a\u2014\u200adue dates, notifications, etc.\u200a\u2014\u200amore than I did. What I learned is that I relied on propinquity: the week journal doc was basically open all day, and as I was adding more information to the various sections I would reacquaint myself with things I need to be working on for Friday, or next week, as I entered new content. And I felt like I had a better big picture sense of what I was working on each day and for the week, than when I just relied on a work management list of tasks.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\">It would also be great\u200a\u2014\u200asince Paper supports the idea of doc sections\u200a\u2014\u200aif sharing could be linked to the section level of a doc, and not just the doc as a whole. Then I could create a section in a journal doc for a single meeting, for example, and invite those attending to share just that section.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\">However, the core problem I\u2019ve encountered is the dimension of time. Journaling and task management aren\u2019t organized around semantic nesting of docs in folders or the semantic structuring of content within docs, which is the organizing principal of Dropbox Paper (and other tools like it). Journaling and task management should naturally be based on time\u200a\u2014\u200ahours, days, weeks, and months\u200a\u2014\u200anot semantic nesting. Yes, I created a form of doc based on a weekly journal, but it\u2019s not native to Paper, just a poor approximation.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\">In my next post in this series, I will be writing about an alternative to content-centric work processing, one that starts with the calendar as its foundation.

They were pragmatic and generally optimistic,\u201d he says. \u201cI also found a contrasting sense of pessimism in the academic and analyst world about \u2018jobless futures.\u2019 \u201d<\/p>\n<p>As one in the \u201cacademic and analyst\u201d community who finds himself in an apparent minority, I jumped at the opportunity to read what optimism Mirchandani had to offer. Truth be told, there\u2019s plenty of it for a relatively simple, yet profound reason: that humanity across the globe sees little reason to give up some of the things that it sees as valuable.<\/p>\n<p>A salutary tale comes from the world of sport \u2014 basketball, specifically, where teams such as California\u2019s Golden State Warriors are using every technology they can get their hands on to monitor performance in training and during games, to detect and pre-empt injuries, to plan seasons and indeed, careers for players.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, technology can only take things so far: as comments Kirk Lacob, Assistant General Manager for the Warriors, \u201cThe reality is that we can&#8217;t influence results completely\u2014and we are a results business. But if we can push and pull the probabilities, we can hope to have a better outcome.\u201d So, yes, technology can augment our capabilities without detracting from them.<\/p>\n<p>But beyond this is a broader picture, about humanity\u2019s relationship with sport. We can argue that it ain\u2019t what it used to be, when kids with sneakers would throw hoops in some godforsaken, dusty back lot. Equally however, however augmented and scientific it becomes, it remains a bunch of people with a ball. For reasons beyond anyone\u2019s ken, that remains interesting.<\/p>\n<p>The same principle can be applied to so many domains, from wine growing to white collar areas such accountancy. Yes, of course many jobs can be automated \u2014 not least the 3 D\u2019s of dull, dirty, and dangerous such as in garbage collection or construction. And it is an open goal of a debating point to say that people in these positions might require some kind of retraining.<\/p>\n<p>But are we, as suggests Vivek Wadhwa, Fellow at the Rock Center for Corporate Governance at Stanford University, heading towards a catastrophe? \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to retrain the workers who lose today\u2019s jobs. They will experience the same unemployment and despair that their forefathers did,\u201d he suggests, arguing against the notion of a luddite fallacy.<\/p>\n<p>Such \u2019despair\u2019 is inevitable, a consequence of the technology-driven income and value disparity that looms in the near distance argue many. Others suggest that such dystopian views are cyclic: \u201cAbout every 50 years, almost like clockwork, we have the collective experience that the sky is falling. Nothing could be further from the truth,\u201d says analyst Denis Pombriant.<\/p>\n<p>Building on this theme, Mirchandani chooses to look to the past to help understand the future. Citing the Law of Unintended consequences, he makes the point that while we do not know what the jobs will be, there will be plenty of them \u2014 \u201cReview FastCompany&#8217;s projection of jobs in the next decade to include Urban Farmers, Neuro-Implant Technicians and Virtual Reality Experience Designer,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a deeper point in the book, that goes way beyond a pantomime \u201cOh yes there will, oh no there won\u2019t\u201d argument. Simply put (though it is explored in detail), it is that technology doesn\u2019t cause inequality, but exploitation does. As new ways of working become possible, we owe it to ourselves to ensure that they are delivered to serve the many, not the few.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s enough in this thoroughly researched and readable <a href=\"http:\/\/amzn.to\/2bRzMgp\">book<\/a> to back the view that automation can sit alongside artisanship, to coin a phrase, both are &#8216;better together&#8217;. Beyond this however, it is the exploitation argument which I found most compelling, and most needy to be addressed by policy and governance. We will only have a bright future for work if we choose to make it so, or, as the commenter Kirby suggests\u00a0on one of my\u00a0previous <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/03\/23\/10-reasons-why-nobody-is-going-to-be-out-of-a-job-in-the-digital-world\/\">articles<\/a>, &#8220;Humans will have much bigger problems on their hands than worry[ing] about having a job.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>P.S.

Just like a sudden volcano eruption that\u2019s been \u00a0slowly surging underneath, an ATP may stay invisible for many months but finally result in serious financial damage, ruining companies\u2019 reputation and even lead to human victims as it happened after the scandalous Ashley Madison data breach.<\/p>\n<p>The annual cyber threat report M-Trends 2016 by Mandiant stated that the average number of days in 2015 during which organizations were compromised before they discovered the breach (or were notified about the breach) was 146. To make things even worse, security specialists reveal the majority of APTs by accident, which means that APTs\u2019 real lifecycle is limited only by the power of vigilance. So is the battle with APTs really a matter of luck? Or is there anything to detect them before they wreck an organization\u2019s assets? <\/p>\n<h3>Why are traditional tools no good?<\/h3>\n<p>With APTs, you may think that organizations are too much negligent about their security and take inadequate security measures. In reality, targeted entities usually adopt the whole range of security tools from standard firewalls and antiviruses to sophisticated anti-malware products. The problem is that these traditional tools aren\u2019t able to withstand an APT attack, leaving a great number of blind spots in an enterprise\u2019s infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>For example, firewalls as an essential part of network security can close unnecessary ports and block unsolicited incoming network traffic. Their advanced versions can even partially protect against DDoS attacks. But they definitely can\u2019t detect malicious users, analyze packets containing malware and obviously they cannot deal with attacks that don\u2019t go through them. Due to traditional firewalls\u2019 limited functionality, most organizations supplement them with intrusion prevention systems (IPS) that allow to examine network traffic flows, detect and prevent vulnerability exploits. However, IPS also have their limitations as they are helpless against client-side application attacks.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, managing an array of security tools is difficult and costly, as you need to acquire multiple software licenses and hire specialists to deal with each particular piece of software. It\u2019s also impossible to manually correlate data from multiple systems in order to detect and respond to proliferating attacks. And, finally, scattered solutions cannot ensure a 360\u00b0 view of a company\u2019s IT environment, which finally results in loopholes that let hackers in.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, today\u2019s security software market offers advanced security information and event management (SIEM) solutions that are able to replace multiple scattered solutions. Even if not considered as the ultimate remedy against APTs, SIEM systems might assist security officers at different stages of an attack. <\/p>\n<h3>Learning from life lessons: The case of Carbanak attacks<\/h3>\n<p>To get all armed for possible attacks, it\u2019s useful to analyze previous mistakes. In the history of security breaches, APTs have a \u2019track record\u2019 of calamitous intrusions. Among them there are a series of attacks by\u00a0the Carbanak\u00a0group that targeted more than 100 banks and other financial institutions in 30 nations (the US named the second biggest target), which made it one of the largest bank thefts ever. <\/p>\n<p>Started out in August 2013, this sophisticated hacking gang was first publicly disclosed only in 2015 when the total gain already reached $1 billion. To stay unnoticed and learn every bank inside out, attackers used a whole range of tactics from spear phishing to latent watch, stealing money in modest batches. The theft was revealed accidentally, after examining one ATM\u2019s strange behavior. However, disclosure didn\u2019t stop the Carbanak hackers from their shady affairs: a new series of attacks were already registered in 2016. This time, the gang aims to double down the previous catch.<br \/>\nBut what if victims had a fine-tuned SIEM solution?<\/p>\n<p>As the banks were unprepared for these attacks and had no relevant solutions in place to detect the APTs, we decided to take this case as an example and illustrate how a fine-tuned SIEM solution, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scnsoft.com\/services\/security-intelligence-services\/siem-services\">IBM QRadar<\/a>, could help to reveal the Carbanak advanced persistent threats.<\/p>\n<h4>Malware Infection<\/h4>\n<p>According to the publicly available details of the attack, the hackers got access to bank employees\u2019 computers through opportunistic malware. IBM Security QRadar QFlow Collector could pinpoint a malware infection by ensuring constant monitoring of the traffic going in and out of an organization. The tool processes sessions and flow information from external sources in such formats as QFlow, NetFlow, SFlow, JFlow and sessions from Packeteer, which allows to baseline network traffic and implement anomaly rules, as well as to build up specific correlation rules to detect the following: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>communications with known botnet control centers and malicious IP addresses. This information can be subscribed (IBM X-Force) or integrated with SIEM from open sources.\u2028<\/li>\n<li>\n<\/li>\n<li>communications with unusual and potentially malicious countries and regions\u2028<\/li>\n<li>\n<\/li>\n<li>communications via unusual ports (e.g. 6667\/IRC)\u2028<\/li>\n<li>\n<\/li>\n<li>communications containing specific payloads (e.g. bot control commands), which is possible with IBM Security QRadar QFlow Collector\u2019s functionality.\u2028<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Spear Phishing<\/h4>\n<p>Once the attackers gained access to employees\u2019 computers, they started a massive spear phishing campaign that was very hard to identify. Indeed, a SIEM solution can hardly distinguish an infected email message originating from a legitimate email account (a workstation with malware) from a legitimate email. However, if the email server is connected to a SIEM solution as a log source, it\u2019s possible to detect the following abnormalities: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>an enormous amount of messages sent from the same account within a short time \u2028<\/li>\n<li>email messages sent in non-business hours from a corporate account\u2028<\/li>\n<li>a huge number of messages with the same subject to different mailboxes\u2028<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The advanced correlation with physical security controls also allows detection of mailouts from users before their check-in through a physical security gate.<\/p>\n<h4>Privilege escalation and deeper reconnaissance<\/h4>\n<p>Systematic spare phishing coupled with malware infection allowed the gang to continue their attack through privilege escalation and deeper reconnaissance that are typical for all APTs. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Privilege escalation could be monitored with a fine-tuned SIEM solution with the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>audit enabled and properly configured on workstations\u2028<\/li>\n<li>log data collected from workstations and sent to a SIEM\u2028<\/li>\n<li>user accounts and roles mapped in a SIEM solution using information from LDAP\/AD\u2028<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In such a scenario, any user with no Admin role logging in with administrative privileges would trigger an alert in a SIEM solution.<br \/>\nMoreover, most of SIEM solutions contain out-of-the-box reconnaissance detection correlation rules that can be fine-tuned to minimize false-positives. In our case, a deeper reconnaissance originating from an internal corporate network could be identified if firewalls were sending access logs to a SIEM solution.<\/p>\n<h4>Latent watch<\/h4>\n<p>To better understand the internal systems, the hackers assigned operators to work with video- and screen-capture feeds grabbed and transmitted to the attackers with the previously injected malware. <\/p>\n<p>The unusual traffic analysis based on anomaly rules would detect video and screen capturing activities since video translation produces a lot of traffic that could be caught by IBM Security QRadar QFlow Collector.<\/p>\n<h4>Infection of computers attached to ATMs<\/h4>\n<p>The Carbanak gang successfully infected computers attached to ATMs in order to make the machines dispense cash. In case if compromised administrative accounts were used to spread infection, a SIEM solution would be able to alert the security personnel about the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a logged admin user account didn\u2019t belong to the attacked server\u2019s support team (mapping with LDAP\/AD)\u2028<\/li>\n<li>a specific admin user account was logged in to many servers in a short time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Additionally, an advanced correlation with Identity and Access Management solutions and Ticketing systems would allow to detect cases when an admin user was logging to the system with no appropriate ticket or IAM allowance. <\/p>\n<h4>Compromise of internal databases and creation of fraudulent accounts<\/h4>\n<p>During the attacks, hackers manipulated Oracle databases to open payment or debit card accounts at the same bank or to transfer money between accounts using the online banking system.\u00a0Normally, all activity related to creating new accounts should pass through a validation procedure. Depending on such a procedure and tools used for validation, this information could be integrated with a SIEM solution to alert on unexpected account creation. If there\u2019s no such validation in place, each new account creation could be alerted and investigated by a security analyst.<\/p>\n<p>A SIEM consultant could help a bank to get reports on business-critical data modification by doing the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>enabling Oracle Fine Grained Auditing (FGA) or a similar audit mechanism \u2028<\/li>\n<li>compiling and integrating a list of approved database users. This would allow to detect data modification performed by unapproved accounts, which could be alerted to by a SIEM solution.\u2028<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Abuse of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication system<\/h4>\n<p>To be able to move large amounts of money into controlled accounts, the attackers abused the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication system. A well-configured SIEM solution could ensure a constant monitoring of all critical financial applications. If a particular application weren\u2019t supported by QRadar out-of-the-box, appropriate parsing, mapping and categorization could be developed. Once custom data is properly normalized, a SIEM solution would be able to detect abnormal money transfers with anomaly correlation rules, if the following are true:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a single account has transferred over the limit\u2028<\/li>\n<li>a single account has made many small transfers to one or several specific accounts\u2028<\/li>\n<li>a total amount of transfers from one account in a specific timeframe passed the limit<\/li>\n<p>\u2028<\/p>\n<li>many accounts made transfers to the same target account in a specific period\u2028<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>You can thwart it<\/h3>\n<p>The case we\u2019ve just analyzed proves that companies are not helpless in their battle against APTs. It may sound strange, but even as sophisticated as they are, APTs have their weakness hiding in the letter &#8220;P.&#8221; Persistence, which is the most difficult to deal with, actually means that attackers leave a lot of traces in the course of their attacks. Thus security administrators well-armed with a relevant SIEM solution have multiple touchpoints to detect intruders and stop them before their illegal activities lead to dramatic data and money losses.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Even though not a prevailing type of cyber attacks, advanced persistent threats (APTs) are definitely the most devastating ones.

Rather Love has taken on an entirely different mission. But before I get into that, a little background will go a long way to understanding what he is doing with this book.<\/p>\n<p>Love is a prolific angel investor in Silicon Valley. Over the course of three decades, he has heard thousands of pitches, invested in nearly sixty companies, and has had a couple of dozen good exits. Additionally, he has been through the wringer himself a few times with his own startups. Again, with success.<\/p>\n<p>And a few years back he was talking with his business partner David Hehman about how virtually all startups go through the same basic steps in their lifecycles. Over and over again, throughout the many years he has been doing what he does, Love saw history repeated again and again in almost every one.<\/p>\n<p>And the interesting thing to Love was that how startups actually unfolded and grew was nothing like how people expected them to do so.<\/p>\n<p>So Love has spent the better part of the last year documenting what he calls the J Curve. The curve has that name because of its general shape. The J Curve is comprised of the six distinct stages that, Love maintains, virtually all startups go through. The ones that are able to make it to the end of the J Curve, well, those are the ones that have succeeded. It is like that kids&#8217; game Candyland, only if you make it all the way through, you don&#8217;t get just get bragging rights, you get a nine-figure check.<\/p>\n<p>The book is a roadmap designed to, I suspect, help the entrepreneur get through each of the steps and to reassure him or her that the craziness happening around them is all perfectly normal.<\/p>\n<p>Startups are hard. I can personally attest to that. There is a part of the J Curve Love calls the &#8220;Long dark winter&#8221; where nothing really went as you planned, demand for your product didn&#8217;t crash the servers, and you feel like all may well be lost. You start rehearsing that phone call with your aunt explaining how you managed to lose the $10,000 she carefully but confidently entrusted in you. I have spent many such winters, and had I had Love\u2019s guidance, I would not have been able to avoid the winters, but I would have taken some reassurance that there was a path out of them.<\/p>\n<p>What the book purports to offer, it does so masterfully. Love&#8217;s knowledge of the lifecycle of startups is encyclopedic and he seems to be able to effortlessly recall example after example to show the various steps along the curve. He writes breezily in an easy-to-read fashion. Although the book clocks in at 260 pages, it is fast read the first time through, but my copy already has a dozen Post-its sticking out of it to mark places I need to return to and contemplate.<\/p>\n<p>In summary, this is not a book for everyone. It is certainly not the kind of book you would ever read for fun. It is a very specific guide to doing a very specific thing: Launching a startup and seeing it though to success. If that is not a journey you are contemplating in life, look elsewhere for reading material, as this would probably be far too dry for you. But if that start-up spark stirs somewhere in your soul, then Love\u2019s book should be on your must-read list.<\/p>\n<p><em>The Start-up J Curve<\/em> is available at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.howardlove.com\" target=\"_blank\">howardlove.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><em>(Full disclosure: Howard Love is an investor in fifty or so technology companies, including Gigaom.

Her 2016 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=334Gfug5OL0\">presentation<\/a> ran to <a href=\"http:\/\/dq756f9pzlyr3.cloudfront.net\/file\/2016_internet_trends_report_final.pdf\">213 slides<\/a>, delivered in a whistle-stop 24 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Given her typical breakneck speed of delivery, Meeker had little more than three minutes to devote to one of her most interesting observations, but it\u2019s one that has huge implications for online and mobile marketing.<\/p>\n<p>In short, the Internet is becoming a far more visual medium, as consumers and <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2015\/11\/25\/3-ways-small-businesses-can-leverage-in-store-mobile-shopping\/\">businesses<\/a> increasingly opt for pictures and videos over text-based communications as a means of storytelling. It\u2019s the younger generation (between the ages of 18 to 34) that shows the most marked preference for pictures over words.<\/p>\n<p>The rise of images has a lot to do with users\u2019 increasing use of smartphones for storytelling, sharing, messaging and creative expression, Meeker said. Worldwide smartphone users grew 21% to over 2.5 billion in 2015, with Android shipments continuing to gain share over iOS: 81% to 16%, respectively. The global mobile user now has, on average, around 33 apps installed on their device, 12 of which are used daily and spends around 4 hours per day on their smartphone.<\/p>\n<p>Because these devices combine cameras, comms and social media access in one handy package, it\u2019s never been easier to take and share images &#8211; and to view and comment on images taken and shared by other people.<\/p>\n<p>Every day, almost 3 billion images are shared on Snapchat, Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp &#8211; all but one of which (Snapchat) are owned by Facebook. That\u2019s up from just under 2 billion in 2014.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to video, meanwhile, daily video views on Facebook rose from 1 billion to 8 billion between 3Q2014 and 3Q2015. On Snapchat, they reached 10 billion in the first quarter of 2016.<\/p>\n<p>User-generated content can result in surprise wins for brands. Take, for example, \u2018Chewbacca Mom\u2019 Candace Payne\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=y3yRv5Jg5TI\">viral video<\/a>, which saw her hooting with laughter, alone in her car, over a Star Wars mask she\u2019d just bought from department store Kohl\u2019s.<\/p>\n<p>The video was viewed over 150 million times in one day &#8211; and also sent Kohl\u2019s mobile app straight to the top of the rankings in the iOS app store. Demand for the mask, naturally, went through the roof. It\u2019s the kind of result that not even the most carefully planned (and costly) marketing campaign could have orchestrated.<\/p>\n<p>But at the same time, brands are working hard to get in on the act, by tuning into our passion for visuals and using them to help promote their brands in new and creative ways.<\/p>\n<p>Pinterest, for example, is fast emerging as a potential goldmine for brands. According to Meeker\u2019s data, around 55% of the site\u2019s users (who passed the 100-million mark in September 2015) say they use the visual bookmarking site to find and shop for products. In response, Pinterest is ramping up its online shopping capabilities, announcing in June 2015 that it is introducing not only shopping carts to the site, but also visual search, which will allow users to upload a photo of a product they like and see images of similar, competing products.<\/p>\n<p>Snapchat filters are another emerging use of Internet-based visuals by brands. These allow users of the site to superimpose masks on photos of themselves, friends, family or public figures. This year\u2019s Cinco de Mayo festival, for example, saw Taco Bell release a branded Snapchat filter that turns the subject\u2019s face into a giant taco. This won the fast-food brand 224 million views.<\/p>\n<p>But creative thinking like this will be key, because traditional video ads simply do not pass muster with modern audiences. In fact, said Meeker, they are largely \u201cineffective\u201d at engaging audiences: 62% of users say they\u2019re annoyed by the \u2018pre-roll\u2019 ads that precede, for example, a YouTube clip; 81% say they mute them; and 92% say they\u2019ve considered using ad-blocking software. A picture (or video) may be worth a thousand words &#8211; but not where it fails to delight, entertain or inspire.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As eagerly awaited as it is wide-ranging, Mary Meeker\u2019s annual Internet Trends Report is a data goldmine for anyone who wants to&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87784643,"featured_media":950711,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950687"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87784643"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=950687"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950687\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/950711"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=950687"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=950687"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=950687"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":950690,"date":"2016-08-22T08:34:56","date_gmt":"2016-08-22T15:34:56","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=950690"},"modified":"2016-08-22T08:45:00","modified_gmt":"2016-08-22T15:45:00","slug":"my-research-agenda-for-the-fall-2016-and-a-call-for-participation","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/08\/22\/my-research-agenda-for-the-fall-2016-and-a-call-for-participation\/","title":{"rendered":"My Research Agenda for the Fall 2016 and a Call for Participation"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>After a few weeks of failed vacation &#8212; my attempts at unbroken away time kept surrendering to business-related meetings and travel &#8212; I&#8217;m &#8216;back&#8217; (as if I ever was &#8216;away&#8217;).<\/p>\n<p>During the few hours of contemplation that I managed, I determined to announce a few research initiatives that I&#8217;ll be kicking off, on the heels of finishing up the <em><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/report\/2016-work-management-narrative-baseline\/\">Work Management Narrative Baseline<\/a><\/strong><\/em>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/report\/marketing-goes-agile\/\"><em><strong>M<\/strong><strong>arketing Goes Agile<\/strong><\/em><\/a>.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Work File-Sync-and-Share<\/strong> &#8212; I am rebooting the former <strong>Enterprise File Sync-and-Share<\/strong> project which was started early in 2016, but which was sidelined for a number of unforeseen reasons.

They incorporate elements of messaging, chat, social media, and file sharing, as well as more workforce specific capabilities like shift scheduling, calendaring, task management, and other functional tools.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been talking with a broad spectrum of vendors, and we will likely launch this in October.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Work Intranets<\/strong> &#8212;\u00a0Intranets are private, content-centric networks used to provide communications and work-related services to internal knowledge-worker teams.

In each case, we are creating a research note that provides a concise take on the niche, and sets context for the trends and &#8216;bends&#8217; (countervailing influences that block adoption) in the marketplace in question. I will take the lead role in these research notes, possibly supported by other researchers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Call for Participation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>And, <strong>about other researchers<\/strong>: <strong>We are taking a different approach to the Gigaom research network<\/strong>. We&#8217;ve had limited success with the model we more-or-less inherited from the old Gigaom, which was to rely on a network of self-motivated\u00a0freelance researchers. This has had mixed results (at the most generous) and in some cases has led to extra effort due to the lack of alignment and integration in research processes. As a result, <strong>we are going to phase that approach out, and adopt a different approach. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>We will &#8212; going forward &#8212; bring aboard only those researchers who want to transition into being full-time staff at Gigaom.\u00a0<\/strong>While those researchers will start as freelancers, it is our intention to only work with senior analysts that we believe will make great contributions as full-time employees. Yes, they would start with a short period of freelance involvement, like three to six months, so we can be certain of the fit. And, to start with,<strong> we will be limiting ourselves in the next months to finding two or three senior analysts who could operate very quickly as Research Directors, managing a research domain for the business, developing new business, and hiring other analysts.<\/strong> So the network going forward will be transitioning from a large number of relatively uninvolved freelancers to a smaller network of full-time researchers where freelancers are involved only as an on ramp to a full-time job.<\/p>\n<p>I am actively seeking one or perhaps two prospective research directors to work with me in the <em><strong>work technologies and future of work<\/strong><\/em> domain, and we are open to more candidates in other domains we are interested in, like <em><strong>internet of things<\/strong><\/em>, <em><strong>big data<\/strong><\/em>, <em><strong>cloud computing<\/strong><\/em>, <em><strong>artificial intelligence<\/strong><\/em>, and others.<\/p>\n<p>At the present time, we are looking for contributors based in the United States, exclusively, people with considerable experience in their domain as analysts, consultants, or journalists (with an analytic bent). We are likely to expand that to other regions in time.<\/p>\n<p>If you are interested in discussing the research agenda, or in participating in the new Gigaom research network, please contact me by <a href=\"mailto:s&#116;&#111;w&#101;&#98;&#111;&#121;&#100;&#64;&#103;igaom&#46;c&#111;&#109;\">email<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After a few weeks of failed vacation &#8212; my attempts at unbroken away time kept surrendering to business-related meetings and travel &#8212;&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2184122,"featured_media":950691,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[359219992,113932,359235265],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950690"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2184122"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=950690"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950690\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/950691"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=950690"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=950690"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=950690"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":950685,"date":"2016-08-22T01:24:49","date_gmt":"2016-08-22T08:24:49","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=950685"},"modified":"2016-08-22T01:29:32","modified_gmt":"2016-08-22T08:29:32","slug":"why-is-resource-management-in-the-corporate-environment-still-a-challenge","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/08\/22\/why-is-resource-management-in-the-corporate-environment-still-a-challenge\/","title":{"rendered":"Why is resource management in the corporate environment still a challenge?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You know the score. You\u2019re faced with the need to find a quiet space to speak with a colleague or client, but didn\u2019t book anywhere. So you grab what looks to be a free meeting room. And thus begins a logistical series of bumps and relocations. \u201cOh, sorry, didn\u2019t realize you\u2019d booked it,\u201d you say. So you gather papers and move somewhere else, for a short time, at least.<\/p>\n<p>Scheduling resources is possibly one of the most tantalizing opportunities offered by technology, but even the simplest of options remain outside our algorithmic grasp. Sure, options exist for meeting room scheduling \u2014 that\u2019s not the point (and it leads to that other, standard part of office life \u2014 the \u201cdidn\u2019t you check it was free on the calendar?\u201d conversation).<\/p>\n<p>Scheduling ourselves is also a huge challenge. This isn\u2019t helped by the oh-so-close-but-not-quite compatibility between calendaring services from Microsoft, Google, and Apple et al. Those working within an organization can stick with one system (I can remember Microsoft saying the biggest problem it had to overcome, way back when it launched Exchange 5.5 was managing free\/busy information). But right now, beyond sharing iCal data, there is little guarantee that a resource will be allocated.<\/p>\n<p>Clearly nobody sent the memo that we\u2019re working in ecosystems, not enterprises these days. Even if your company has a corporate standard, as soon as you try to book a meeting with a client or a supplier, you hit the challenge of knowing whether they actually received the meeting request. Oh, woe to all such services and a plague on their houses, as they try to drag you into a Skype session when no such facility exists, or offer a shared space only accessible to a subset of participants.<\/p>\n<p>It should all be so simple, but it quite clearly is not for a number of reasons. First the complexity of resource scheduling, even for something as simple as calendaring meeting rooms, is beyond the ken of most of the tools corporate users have at their behest. <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2016\/02\/05\/mobile-devices-unleash-the-power-of-big-data-in-logistics\/\">Supply chain<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2016\/03\/21\/driving-for-success-with-fleet-telematics-infographic\/\">fleet management<\/a> and spares management companies have capabilities to deal with their specific needs, but these are as expensive as they are custom, and not suitable for the masses.<\/p>\n<p>Not suitable yet, that should read. Consider Workwave for example, which offers field service management for organisations who rely on scheduling people to deliver their services, from home care to pest control, but whose heritage is in office efficiency. From Workwave and others we can see how field service is maturing, adding features such as video clips to be added to an invoice to show a job is complete, or location based mechanisms to enable more efficient routing.<\/p>\n<p>In parallel, field service is looking towards analytics, to identify ways to become <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2016\/07\/20\/better-supply-chain-management-can-curb-lost-sales\/\">more efficient<\/a> (or most likely, identify places where they are being inefficient) \u2014 such as using routing data to identify repeated bottlenecks.\u00a0&#8220;You can get previews into customer experience hotspots, where possible issues are,\u201d says Workwave\u2019s CEO, Chris Sullens.\u00a0The\u00a0consequence is better orchestration, to the benefit of all parties \u2014 company, employee and customer.\u00a0\u201cFor some categories, e.g. maid service, we can take a planned activity and make it on-demand,\u201d continues Chris.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2016\/08\/12\/field-service-apps-improve-productivity-in-the-oil-and-gas-industry\/\">field service resource<\/a> scheduling can move to real-time if the systems are there to manage it, increasing flexibility without adding cost. Such features clearly have a place beyond field service, as do more leading edge capabilities such as use of wearables. For these advanced capabilities to be effective however, they need to be open and integrated.\u00a0\u201cThe challenge is, you want all or nothing,\u201d explains Chris. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to hit a tipping point otherwise not going to get a benefit.\u201d This is as true in the office environment as a food plant.<\/p>\n<p>Technology has a habit of commoditizing, with features jumping from vertical-specific areas and into what might be termed \u2018the mainstream&#8217;. In this case, our ability to orchestrate our time with each other and the resources we use appears tantalizingly close. But until either the majors address their compatibility issues (guys, nobody is going to walk away from your software if you integrate each others\u2019 scheduling tools, really they are not), or somebody else comes up with an generalized mechanism for managing such things, we\u2019ll have to stick with coping strategies.<\/p>\n<p>Oh, sorry, did you book this meeting room?

Rodolphe Gelin now leads the Innovation team which aims to develop new technologies for current robots and continue exploration of humanoid robotics.<\/p>\n<p>Rodolphe Gelin will be speaking at the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/change\/\">Gigaom Change Leaders Summit<\/a><\/strong> in Austin, September 21-23rd. In anticipation of that, I caught up with him to ask a few questions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Byron Reese: People have imagined robots for literally thousands of years. What do you think is the source of this fascination?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Rodolphe Gelin:<\/strong> The idea of robots has fed our curiosity for more than half a century with the potential of having another form factor to interact with on our own natural terms. In reality robots offer us much more and, through recent technological innovations, robots are now helping us reach the next frontier in artificial intelligence research and engineering. As mankind has evolved our inherent nature is to create, build and then continue to evolve what we&#8217;ve created; advancing in technology is no different. As high tech has become more prolific, we are constantly on a quest to evolve our technical knowledge. Robotics represents the next step or extension of that continued innovation.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\n<strong>It is obviously extremely difficult to make a robot with the range of motion and movement as a human. What are some of the things that make it tricky?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Humans have evolved very specific types of muscles which provide us with strength, force and speed that currently no available motor can match. The complexity of the human skeleton gives us extraordinary mobility and support. This type of support is also very difficult to duplicate mechanically. In addition, to creating a general form factor for humanoid robots there are other details to consider like fluidity and other natural movements that require intricate programming, as well as various sensors and processors that would help identify the robot\u2019s surroundings.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\n<strong>Do you foresee robots that are indistinguishable from humans? Would people want that?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At SoftBank Robotics, we strongly believe that robots should look like robots. Our robots, Pepper, NAO and Romeo, were created to resemble a human-like figure, but they do not look like us. While there are indeed some robotics scientists today who have created robots that look like humans which include features like eyes, and &#8220;skin,&#8221; similar to a wax figure. That is not where we are headed with our development of robots. All robotics research is ongoing and as each form factor becomes more advanced some robots could look very much like their human counterparts. However, SoftBank Robotics is focused on creating approachable robots that make people feel comfortable and happy. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Do you think that the computing power of robots will eventually be such that they attain consciousness?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think that a machine that plays chess will attain consciousness even with a lot of computing power. If consciousness is someday available in a computer, it will be because a human being would have programmed it, in one way or another. A robot is a machine that does what it has been programmed to do. If the programmer does not program a replicated state of &#8216;consciousness&#8217;, there would be no way for the program get one.\u00a0 Having random &#8216;conscious-like&#8217; processing could be seen in the form of a computer glitch but the software designer should detect and correct it, if he is not happy with the behavior. And if a developer wants to give a consciousness to his robot, he probably can. But what would be the purpose of it? To give a moral sense to the robot?

That dimension is the cloud. These days, not being able to include cloud-based software in your systems is tantamount to cutting off your arm.\u00a0 Some software is strictly available in the cloud.<\/p>\n<p>Certainly, with the data sizes involved in databases today, the cloud makes the utmost of sense for storing large, fast-growing amounts of non-sensitive data for which it is extremely difficult to estimate its ultimate size.<\/p>\n<p>However, the cloud is not the cloud is not the cloud.\u00a0The cloud is very multidimensional.\u00a0As such, it is among the most abused terms in our industry.<\/p>\n<p>The cloud can be public or private.\u00a0 It can be software, infrastructure, or platform as a service.\u00a0 It can be single- or multi-tenant (with tenants being other departments or other companies).\u00a0 Also, a wide variety of application areas can be deployed on the cloud.<\/p>\n<p>At the least, cloud means virtualization -\u2013 the abstraction of developers from their hardware internally.\u00a0I have seen many companies that begin a quasi-private-cloud journey with the system administration group creating more of an SLA-based approach to their duties: \u201cGive us your requirements and we\u2019ll provide the machine(s).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Server management is one of those technologies that is not considered a core competency of developing applications.\u00a0It requires unique skill sets.\u00a0So it is increasingly being delivered by service level to applications, including information management applications that need servers to function, which is most of them.<\/p>\n<p>This presents a reality of co-existence between on-premise, private cloud and public cloud solutions, which will be the norm for the remainder of our careers.<\/p>\n<p>GigaOm is conducting original research into this rapidly changing space. We are taking a close look at relational databases in the cloud: databases built for the cloud, databases that have been reengineered to work in the cloud, and databases that can reasonably be deployed in the cloud. We will publish our findings in an upcoming report.<br \/>\nThe main cloud benefits for databases are the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flexibility to scale computing resources<\/li>\n<li>Ability to shorten implementation windows<\/li>\n<li>Reduced cost<\/li>\n<li>Testing, development, and sandboxing environments<\/li>\n<li>Geographic scalability<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Database deployments in the cloud are at an all-time high and are poised to expand dramatically. We are looking at vendors who offer these value propositions to enterprises.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of architecture, an organization considering a cloud database must determine its fit in the overall architecture of their current infrastructure and information ecosystem. When architecting for current and future data needs, there are key considerations across the board including data sources, change data capture, windows for extraction, data integration, security (as well as privacy and encryption), data validation, quality assurance, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>The report will also present a fast-track methodology for landing and expanding databases in the cloud for an enterprise.<\/p>\n<p>The cloud has been a disruptive technology that many companies have leveraged to maintain or gain momentum as a company. The cloud offers opportunities to differentiate and innovate with database systems at a much more rapid pace than ever before possible. Cloud storage costs less, enables more rapid server deployment and application development, and offers scalability.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>If your value proposition to the market includes database services in the cloud, you are invited to get in touch and share that proposition. <a href=\"https:\/\/ben554.typeform.com\/to\/MBD5sV\">Contact Gigaom regarding participation in our research.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Due to its complexity, cloud strategy will be the most challenging business driver in the years to come.

After all, SDNs can be complex beasts that need constant care and attention. That said, the drive behind adopting SDN technology is skyrocketing. <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.gartner.com\/andrew-lerner\/2014\/12\/08\/predicting-sdn-adoption\/\">Gartner reports <\/a>that by the end of 2016, more than 10,000 enterprises will have deployed SDN technology on their networks, a tenfold increase from end-of-year 2014.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the rapid adoption of the technology, many enterprises have <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.gartner.com\/andrew-lerner\/2015\/09\/18\/sdn-failures\/\">encountered failures<\/a> when trying to transition to the technology. The reasons are numerous, with complexity defined as one of the major reasons for failure. Yet, there is another issue under the subtext of SDN deployment, one that derails the transition from pilot project to deployed technology. That issue can be summed up as unpredictable performance. While SDN networking performance seems to be adequate during the pilot project stage, an actual deployment reveals issues that directly impact the end user. In other words, many SDN deployments are derailed by end user experiences.<\/p>\n<p>Detecting and understanding those performance issues are currently a major challenge for those working with SDN technologies, throw WAN connectivity and application servers into the mix, and troubleshooting performance issues becomes an impossibility.<\/p>\n<p>Several vendors are attempting to address that problem with optimization appliances, which can improve performance and solve some of the performance problems. However, to truly deal with performance issues, one needs more that optimization, they also need visibility in the form of end to end monitoring. Many vendors have focused their WAN optimization solutions on the WAN to LAN to WAN ideology, making sure that the networks are able to communicate effectively. However, it is often what happens at the endpoint is what really defines success.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, your WAN and SDN can be the fastest in the world, but if that performance doesn\u2019t translate to the applications and the endpoints accessing them, then your SDN deployment may be classified as a failure.<\/p>\n<p>Something Nik Koutsoukos, VP of Product Marketing at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.riverbed.com\">Riverbed<\/a> has become keenly aware of. In an interview with GigaOM, Koustsoukos said \u201cperformance is often judged by how the end user is impacted, something that is really evident when the endpoints are running virtual desktops that are hosted on the corporate network.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Koustsoukos added \u201cTo address performance issues, it is critical to be able to understand what is happening on the endpoint and the related applications, the only way to do that is to have end to end visibility.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>With that in mind, Riverbed has acquired <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aternity.com\/\">Aternity<\/a>, a company that specializes in end user experience monitoring. Koustsoukos said \u201cAternity brings with it the ability to analyze end to end application performance and how availability, latency, execution and quality are perceived by the end user.\u201d\u00a0 Koustsoukos further said \u201cBy incorporating Aternity\u2019s features into Riverbed SteelCentral, administrators will have complete visibility in an enterprise\u2019s application delivery ecosystem, a capability that will be sure to ease troubleshooting and enhance performance.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For those looking to optimize WAN connectivity, deliver networking via SDNs, and improve the end user experience, Riverbed seems to have hit the nail on the head. One can only hope that the integration of such diverse capabilities will ultimately move SDN further ahead, while resolving the annoying performance issues that hamper end user productivity.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One can only hope that the integration of diverse capabilities will ultimately move SDN ahead<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8020068,"featured_media":950662,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[359220112,58642,359222953,271299,57268],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950661"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8020068"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=950661"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950661\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/950662"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=950661"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=950661"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=950661"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":950657,"date":"2016-08-16T11:00:56","date_gmt":"2016-08-16T18:00:56","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=950657"},"modified":"2016-08-17T11:15:05","modified_gmt":"2016-08-17T18:15:05","slug":"ai-for-an-eye","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/08\/16\/ai-for-an-eye\/","title":{"rendered":"AI for an Eye"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>While they predate the warm and fuzzy moniker that is \u201cwearables,\u201d contact lenses are one of the more common pieces of technology applied to the body today. But, unlike most other commercial <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2015\/12\/29\/wearables-in-healthcare-and-4-more-healthcare-trends-from-2015\/\">wearable devices<\/a>, corrective contact lenses have not been particularly sexy. They help us see as well as we should see and then their job ends. Or, at least, that\u2019s where it has historically\u2014yes, like everything from cars to shoes to refrigerators, the contact lens is about to get \u201csmart.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The innovation of smart contact lenses is moving in a few different directions. One notable and noble pursuit is health monitoring. Alphabet\u2019s Verily (formerly Google Life Sciences) is doing work here, with a lens that monitors (via tears) blood glucose levels for diabetics, and startup <a href=\"http:\/\/mobihealthnews.com\/content\/glucose-sensing-contact-lens-developer-medella-health-gets-14m\">Medella Health<\/a> recently secured $1.4 million for its competitive product. Meanwhile, Swiss-based <a href=\"http:\/\/www.medscape.com\/viewarticle\/859997\">Sensimed AG<\/a>, has received FDA approval for a lens that tests eye pressure for glaucoma patients. Unlike traditional glaucoma tests, Sensimed AG\u2019s Triggerfish makes it possible to monitor eye pressure for a 24-hour period, including sleep, for more accurate assessment of a glaucoma patient\u2019s risk of vision loss.<\/p>\n<p>The contact lens has an advantage in the <a href=\"https:\/\/insights.samsung.com\/2016\/02\/16\/the-top-wearable-technology-at-ces-2016-and-why-it-matters-to-healthcare\/\">health monitoring space<\/a>\u2014at least compared to other wearables that didn\u2019t originate as medical devices and don\u2019t connect so intimately with the body\u2014but this isn\u2019t the only future for the smart lens. There are new opportunities for vision correction coming, as evidenced by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-novartis-ceo-idUSKCN0R50E920150905\">Google and Novartis<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/google-novartis-and-epgl-in-race-to-develop-first-autofocus-contact-lens-300116881.html\">EPGL<\/a>; both teams are developing autofocus lenses in an\u00a0effort to correct farsightedness. And, of course, there are a number of other innovations in the works that will appeal to our sci-fi\u2019d imaginations, like Ocumetrics, a company that reportedly has created a <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3894170\/bionic-eye\/\">lens that improves vision 3x better than 20\/20<\/a>. While their \u201cbionic\u201d lens, technically a surgical implant, has received some skepticism from the medical community, it generated a fair amount of buzz in social media. (And, understandably so; for those of us who spent childhoods watching <i>The Six Million Dollar Man, <\/i>the wait for bionic vision has been long and grueling.)<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Samsung recently filed a patent for a smart lens, which, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sammobile.com\/2016\/04\/05\/samsung-is-working-on-smart-contact-lenses-patent-filing-reveals\/\">Sammobile<\/a>, \u201cshows a contact lens equipped with a tiny display, a camera, an antenna, and several sensors that detect movement and the most basic form of input using your eyes: blinking.\u201d This is foundational user interface stuff that sets us up for interactions akin to Google Glass, but right there on the eyeball. It leads a future where the recording of experiences becomes incidental and video games, augmented and virtual reality can be experienced without the need for bulky equipment. In this way, tech becomes more discreet\u2014a point of interest to marketers who have relied on the showmanship of early adopters because how do you fuel word of mouth for \u201cinvisible\u201d technology?<\/p>\n<p>More provocative, however, is the potential for change in human behavior as the boundaries between our bodies and information continue to dissolve. If you think there\u2019s no need to lock facts, figures, and trivia into memory because your smartphone is in your pocket today, wait until you can blink your way through IMDB. And how does human interaction shift when Facetime happens <i>in <\/i>your face, when we have the power to conduct background checks on the fly? (\u201cHello, it\u2019s great to meet you and\u2026um&#8230;are you browsing my Facebook page <i>right now<\/i>?\u201d) Given the pace of innovation today, it\u2019s not difficult to imagine a world where the smart lens gives a lawyer or student a steroid-like advantage on the intellectual playing field, or a quick lens check become the norm before, say, the National Spelling Bee\u2014all before the next time you need to renew your driver\u2019s license.<\/p>\n<p>As all the world\u2019s information migrates from our fingertips to our eyes, the next logical step is to introduce some level of processing of the information\u2014artificial intelligence\u2014in a lens. Progress here depends a lot on computer vision, the same technology that helps a self-driving car distinguish between a traffic light and a man wearing a green hat. Computer vision is one of the more intensive areas of innovation today\u2014<a href=\"http:\/\/www.slate.com\/articles\/technology\/future_tense\/2015\/01\/artificial_intelligence_can_t_recognize_these_simple_images.html\">Slate<\/a> published an interesting piece on the challenges\u2014and naturally there are a number of innovators tackling it. This includes a Russian developer that has created an <a href=\"http:\/\/tech.firstpost.com\/news-analysis\/developer-creates-open-source-computer-vision-platform-that-lets-machines-see-318718.html\">open source computer vision platform<\/a> in collaboration with both Google and Facebook. It\u2019s also likely that large scope of data acquired as a result of the first wave of camera-like smart lenses will play a meaningful role in advancing computer vision. In other words, smart lens wearers will be effectively teaching computers how to see.<\/p>\n<p>But we\u2019re not cyborgs (eyeborgs?) yet. Even as humans get more comfortable with the idea of body hacking via objects like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/national\/health-science\/these-real-life-cyborgs-hack-their-bodies-with-chips-magnets-and-other-tech\/2016\/06\/10\/2188f318-25ec-11e6-b989-4e5479715b54_story.html\">radio frequency ID chips<\/a>, there\u2019s still something squeamish about putting technology right there in the eye. \u00a0(Cue <i>A Christmas Story<\/i>: \u201cYou\u2019ll shoot your eye out.\u201d) Innovations in miniaturization, like ETH Zurich\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ethz.ch\/en\/news-and-events\/eth-news\/news\/2014\/01\/eye-catching-electronics.html\">ultra-thin circuit<\/a>\u201450 times thinner than a human hair\u2014help address these concerns.<\/p>\n<p>There is also the powering of smart lens technology to consider\u2014how do these things get their juice? Google\u2019s glucose-monitoring lens would be powered by a <a href=\"http:\/\/diatribe.org\/google-secures-patent-glucose-sensing-contact-lens\">\u201creader\u201d device<\/a>, such as a piece of clothing or headband that sits near the lens. Google also has a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.techinsider.io\/google-awarded-patent-for-solar-powered-contact-lens-2015-10\">patent for solar-powered contact lens<\/a>, while <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/sony-patents-contact-lens-that-records-what-you-see\/\">Sony\u2019s recent patent<\/a> includes \u201c&#8230;sensors [that] would convert the movements of the eye into energy to power the lens.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>With these and other patents and products in the works today, it\u2019s clear to see that both the reach and role of the contact lens is on the brink of transformation. From vision correction and enhancement to health monitoring, from entertainment to data capture and processing, the range of applications for smart lenses is vast and sets the stage for a behavioral shift on par with\u2014if not more substantial\u2014than what we\u2019ve seen with the mobile device. While we\u2019re not quite there yet, it\u2019s a good time to start thinking about the implications\u2014if recent advances in technology have taught us anything, it\u2019s that big changes can happen in the blink of an eye.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While they predate the warm and fuzzy moniker that is \u201cwearables,\u201d contact lenses are one of the more common pieces of technology&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":87833663,"featured_media":950659,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[359256555,359215936,359256557,359219805,359256556,69613704,359217384,359256558,359216159],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950657"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/87833663"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=950657"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950657\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/950659"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=950657"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=950657"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=950657"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":950613,"date":"2016-08-12T09:05:02","date_gmt":"2016-08-12T16:05:02","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=950613"},"modified":"2016-09-07T13:30:47","modified_gmt":"2016-09-07T18:30:47","slug":"will-the-olympics-break-your-internet","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/08\/12\/will-the-olympics-break-your-internet\/","title":{"rendered":"Will the Olympics Break Your Internet?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>The worldwide games are sure to have an impact on the world wide web, however judging that impact proves to be more of a science than an art. After all, predictions can be based upon what happened four short years ago, when the 2012 Olympics generated some 628 million video streams and 8.2 billion page views.<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, NBC is claiming that the 2016 Olympics will be its \u201cmost live Olympics ever\u201d, with over 4,500 hours of coverage streaming to billions of potential viewers. What NBC fails to say is how all that traffic will impact corporate networks. While there is little worry that the Olympics will break the internet, the amount of content available may surely have an impact on business networks, as workers strive to see the latest scores and live stream events.<\/p>\n<p>The potential productivity drain created by the Olympics has many businesses a little worried, after all those businesses want their employees attending to their chores and not attending (virtually) Olympic events. However, the worries should go beyond lost productivity due to workers watching events, the potential for network disruption may raise its ugly head and bring network performance to a crawl, impacting every one and not those just sneaking a peek at a gold medal ceremony.<\/p>\n<p>A<a href=\"http:\/\/www.riverbed.com\/content\/dam\/riverbed-www\/en_US\/Images\/Blogs\/OlympicInfographic2016-small.png\"> recent survey<\/a> by Riverbed, a WAN optimization vendor, predicts that the bandwidth consumed by the 2016 Olympics will far outpace what was experienced just four years ago at the Beijing based 2008 Olympics, bringing additional doubt that business networks will be able to smoothly handle the strain.<\/p>\n<p>However, there are some simple steps network administrators can take to mitigate bandwidth sapping issues before they bring traffic to a crawl. Respondents to Riverbed\u2019s survey prove to be a fount of actionable information and are offering the following statistics:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>69% of those surveyed claimed to have one or more network issues due to employees accessing online games content<\/li>\n<li>85% are expecting to more closely monitor the performance of their networks and applications<\/li>\n<li>Only 43% are confident that they will be able to safeguard critical applications during high network demand<\/li>\n<li>12% report that they lack the confidence that their networks will be able to handle the added strain and traffic<\/li>\n<li>70% will limit employees from accessing games content through the network<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>With the Olympic stage set, network administrators are going to have to deal with the traffic demand proactively, and get their hands a little dirty with the plumbing of their networks. To head off a potential network traffic disaster, Nik Koutsoukos, VP of Product Marketing at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.riverbed.com\">Riverbed<\/a> is offering some free advice.<\/p>\n<p>In a phone interview with GigaOM, Koutsoukos offered that network managers should consider doing the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement real-time end-to-end monitoring for visibility into the network and applications<\/li>\n<li>Prioritize and reserve bandwidth for critical applications<\/li>\n<li>Distinguish between company assets and BYOD<\/li>\n<li>Bring siloed IT teams together to plan for any high priority network events<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Koutsoukos\u2019 advice rings true, to be able to manage the bandwidth monster, administrators need to have full visibility into what is exactly happening on the network and how critical applications are being impacted. With that knowledge, administrators can craft bandwidth policies that can strike a happy medium between critical applications and ancillary network usage.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The worldwide games are sure to have an impact on the world wide web, however judging that impact proves to be more&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8020068,"featured_media":950615,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[],"tags":[1215089,359256425,359216796,359222953],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950613"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/8020068"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=950613"}],"version-history":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/950613\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/950615"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=950613"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=950613"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=950613"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":950423,"date":"2016-08-10T13:19:30","date_gmt":"2016-08-10T20:19:30","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/?p=950423"},"modified":"2017-03-16T13:01:38","modified_gmt":"2017-03-16T18:01:38","slug":"why-fear-ai","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/2016\/08\/10\/why-fear-ai\/","title":{"rendered":"Why Fear AI?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><em>At <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/gigaom.com\/change\/\">Gigaom Change Leader&#8217;s Summit 2016<\/a><\/strong> in September, we will be exploring seven key business technologies that are real today. One of these is AI. In anticipation of that event, we are doing a series of short pieces on the featured technologies.<\/em> <\/p>\n<p>In 1950, Alan Turing asked the question of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thecritique.com\/articles\/what-was-alan-turings-imitation-game\/\">whether a machine can think<\/a>. In 1955, John McCarthy coined the term &#8220;Artificial Intelligence.&#8221; In 1956, a group consisting of McCarthy and three other AI scientists proposed a summer retreat to work out the essentials of the new field. <\/p>\n<p>The optimism ran high that a thinking machine could be developed relatively quickly, even with the technology of that time. This optimism proved to be unfounded. <\/p>\n<p>AI has endured a number of so-called &#8220;winters&#8221; where funding dried up due to a disconnect between the expectation of the funders and the realities of the science. But all the while, the power of computers and computer languages advanced such that for the first time, the expectations aren&#8217;t just being met, but being exceeded. <\/p>\n<p>Now, some wonder if we have inadvertently begun to act out the drama in Mary Shelley&#8217;s Frankenstein, creating something that either through intention or accident wreaks havoc on our world. Some call it an existential threat. <\/p>\n<p>But should we worry? Let\u2019s dive in.<\/p>\n<p>First, those suggesting caution: <\/p>\n<p>Physicist Stephen Hawking believes development of a true AI would be no less than &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-30290540\">the end of the human race<\/a>.&#8221; According to Hawking, the fundamental problem is that AI would iterate and advance rapidly, whereas we &#8220;[h]umans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn&#8217;t compete, and would be superseded.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk is equally bearish on AI, calling it the &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.livescience.com\/48481-elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-threat.html\">biggest existential threat<\/a>&#8221; facing mankind, &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/495759307346952192\">potentially more dangerous than nukes<\/a>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is more restrained, saying he&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/IAmA\/comments\/2tzjp7\/hi_reddit_im_bill_gates_and_im_back_for_my_third\/\">in the camp that is concerned about super intelligence<\/a>,&#8221; because decades of accelerating progress may result in an intelligence so advanced that it&#8217;s hard to control.<\/p>\n<p>Now, let&#8217;s hear from the other side:<\/p>\n<p>Linguist and behavioralist Noam Chomsky, far from panicking about malevolent AI, thinks the entire pursuit of a statistically-driven AI is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/technology\/archive\/2012\/11\/noam-chomsky-on-where-artificial-intelligence-went-wrong\/261637\/?single_page=true\">barking up the wrong tree<\/a>. He says it&#8217;s a shallow approach which may have practical applications but is unlikely to yield real insight into the nature of intelligence or cognition.<\/p>\n<p>AI author Ray Kurzweil <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3641921\/dont-fear-artificial-intelligence\/\">isn&#8217;t afraid<\/a> of artificial intelligence, either. He analogizes to other scientific endeavors with doomsday potential, like biotechnology, observing that safety rules and ethical guidelines have kept those technologies relatively safe.<\/p>\n<p>And finally, deep learning pioneer Andrew Ng actually mocks the idea of an &#8216;evil killer AI,&#8217; downplaying concerns as a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.quora.com\/Is-A-I-an-existential-threat-to-humanity\">phantom<\/a>&#8221; and an unnecessary policy distraction. To Ng, &#8220;[w]orrying about AI evil superintelligence today is like worrying about overpopulation on the planet Mars. We haven&#8217;t even landed on the planet yet!&#8221;\t<\/p>\n<p>So what is the net of all of this? Well, when the estimates from smart people as to when we will have AGI vary from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1977\/08\/27\/archives\/man-and-machine-match-minds-at-mit-5th-conference-on-artificial.html?_r=0\">five to 500 years<\/a>,  there is obviously neither clarity nor consensus about the future.

We give a junior engineer the big promotion, make him an engineering supervisor, and he keeps acting like he\u2019s just a project engineer. He acts like nothing has changed. They don\u2019t step into that role. There is a big leadership gap, especially at those lower levels. How are we supposed to find those people who have sufficient technical skill to be in charge of an engineering project but are also suited for leadership?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This is the holy grail of retention: identifying and building new leaders. It\u2019s not just retaining the best technical talent. Rather, it is retaining those with the best technical ability who are also willing and able to take on leadership responsibilities and helping them step into those roles successfully. How many people have both the technical ability and the desire and ability to lead?<\/p>\n<p>What usually happens is this. Those who are very good at their jobs (those with technical ability) are given more and more work. Over time, they need people to help them. If they are willing and available, these people are given supervisory responsibilities, sometimes informally at first. Eventually they become managers and are taught how to complete the additional paperwork that comes with their managerial responsibilities. But they are rarely taught how to be a manager. Instead, they develop their own management styles on an ad hoc basis, struggle, and finally conclude they are not management material. Usually they are stuck, in one organization or another, struggling with management responsibilities that nobody ever really taught them how to handle. They go through their careers thinking, \u201cI\u2019m not a natural leader. I\u2019m a . . .\u201d (You fill in the blank: accountant, engineer, doctor.)<\/p>\n<p>Over the years, some business leaders have tried to fight this conundrum by creating technical tracks and manager tracks. The idea is that those who are great technicians can continue growing as technicians, while the \u201cpeople people\u201d are encouraged to follow the manager track instead. The problem with this strategy is that if an individual doesn\u2019t have the technical talent, he will have a lack of credibility when it comes to playing the manager role. Who is going to manage an accountant but an accountant? Who is going to manage an engineer but an engineer?<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why, when you are looking for new leaders, you have to focus first and foremost on those with real technical talent, those who are really good at their jobs. These are the individuals who have demonstrated their commitment to their work and careers. That commitment is the first essential piece when it comes to identifying new prospects for leadership roles.<\/p>\n<p>The problem is, especially among the best Millennial technical talent, that there are a lot of people who are committed to their work and career but are reluctant to take on supervisory roles. Why? The main reason, according to our research, is that they can see with their own eyes the experience of their own managers and their slightly more advanced peers. What they see is that managers, especially new managers, are often given loads of additional responsibility with very little additional support.<\/p>\n<p>What do new managers need? They need support and guidance in learning and practicing the basics of management.<\/p>\n<p>When you ask a young star to step up and make the transition to a leadership role\u2014at any level\u2014you owe it to that new leader and her team to make sure that she is fully prepared to take on additional responsibilities and authority. Teach new leaders how to do the people work, and then support and guide them in this new role every step of the way:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Explain that this new role carries with it real authority, that it does not award her license, of course, to act like a jerk. It is a huge responsibility that should not be accepted lightly.<\/li>\n<li>Spell out for the new leader exactly what her new leadership responsibilities look like. Explain that management entails more than completing some extra paperwork. You have to explain the \u201cpeople work\u201d in detail. Create standard operating procedures for managing, and teach them to all new leaders. Focus on the basics, like spelling out expectations for every employee who works for them, following up regularly, tracking performance closely in writing, and holding people accountable.<\/li>\n<li>Make sure you formally deputize any new leader, no matter how small the project or how short the duration of the leadership role. Don\u2019t just whisper it in the new leader\u2019s ear: \u201cI want you to take charge of this project and make sure everyone on the team pulls his weight.\u201d You need to announce the new leadership to the whole team, articulate the nature of this person\u2019s new authority, and explain the standard operating procedures for management that you have asked the new leader to follow.<\/li>\n<li>Check in daily (or every other day) with this new leader. Regularly walk through the standard operating procedures for managing people. Ask about the management challenges she is probably facing. At first, you might want to sit in on the new leader\u2019s team meetings and one-on-ones with team members in order to build up this new leader. Do everything you can to reinforce her authority with the team and every individual on the team. But make sure to take every opportunity you can to help the new leader refine and improve her management techniques.<\/li>\n<li>Pay close attention every step of the way, and evaluate the new leader in her new role. Some new leaders will practice the basics with great discipline; some won\u2019t. Some will be consistent in their application of the basics; some won\u2019t. Some will grow comfortable in their new leadership roles; some won\u2019t. And some will simply fail in the leadership role. But it turns out that with the right amount of guidance and support, most people who are very good at their jobs and committed to their work and career have the ability to grow into strong competent leaders.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<hr \/>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>About the Author<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Bruce Tulgan is an adviser to business leaders all over the world and a sought-after keynote speaker and seminar leader.

After all, Cyber Attacks constitute one of the biggest threats to operations and those threats are growing in ferocity and frequency, something the typical SMB operator fails to comprehend.<\/p>\n<p>Although the news is rife with the details of the latest cyber-attack, intrusion or malware infestations, SMBs, for the most part, feel that those are threats to only the largest of businesses, and that the typical SMB is protected simply by anonymity. In other words, cyber criminals will simply ignore SMBs, because they are unaware of the existence of those small and medium businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Nothing could be further from the truth, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.verizonenterprise.com\/DBIR\/\">Verizon Data Breach Investigative Report<\/a> reveals that SMBs are the top targets of cybercriminals and suffer breaches more often than larger firms. What\u2019s more, the impact of a breach on an SMB proves more devastating, with a study from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.staysafeonline.org\/\">National Cyber Security Alliance<\/a> stating that some 60% of SMBs cease operations within six months of a data breach.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously the stakes are high, yet many IT pros have trouble explaining the potential devastation that a cyber-attack can wreck upon the typical SMB. Perhaps the best place to start is with the identification of why SMBs have become so targeted by the nefarious denizens of the web. One of the reasons that SMBs prove to be ripe targets is that the way most SMBs deploy security tools, which are ill equipped to combat today\u2019s advanced attacks. Many SMBs rely on traditional security products, such as anti-malware products and basic firewalls, thinking that those products offer adequate protection.<\/p>\n<p>However, the truth is that those products are woefully inadequate when it comes to targeted attacks, insider threats or advanced persistent threats. The reason being is that those technologies rely on approaches such as signature files, URL blacklists and static policies to mitigate attacks.<\/p>\n<p>The simple fact of the matter is that most cyber attackers are very rational in how they target systems. In other words, there are strong incentives fueling the attack, which range from the value of the data that can be obtained (credit card information, user accounts, and so forth) to the likelihood that an attack will go undetected for weeks, months, or even years, if ever. Simply put, most of the defenses deployed by SMBs today are designed to deal with known threats and cannot counter the zero day or blended threats that are becoming all too common.<\/p>\n<p>A survey by the <a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/1\/2013\/11\/2013-ponemon-institute-midmarket-trends-sophos.pdf\">Poneman Institute<\/a> further paints the picture of SMBs taking a na\u00efve approach to cyber security, with some 60% that do not consider cyber-attacks to be a big risk to their organizations, while 44% don\u2019t consider strong security to be a priority. It is those misplaced beliefs that pose the largest challenge for those looking to keep SMBs\u2019 systems secure, making worthwhile security suggestions fall on deaf ears.<\/p>\n<p>However, the purveyors of SMB security solutions do have a strong ally on their side, one that is hard to ignore, and that is the financial argument. An argument that purveys the concept of what the cost of doing nothing is. Extensive research has been conducted on that very element, which can be summarized as the high cost of suffering an attack. For the financial impacts of a cyber-attack, SMBs can turn to an interactive info-graphic from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.towergateinsurance.co.uk\/liability-insurance\/smes-and-cyber-attacks\">Towergate Insurance<\/a>, which offers a visual representation of collected facts and numbers.<\/p>\n<p>The Ponemon Institute further highlights the financial burden in an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nsba.biz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/Technology-Survey-2013.pdf\">NSBA report<\/a> that states the average cost of a cyber-attack was over $8000, a significant amount of money to the typical small business. However, that cost does not include intangibles, such as down time, loss of business, remediation and so forth, meaning that the actual cost to an SMB is possibly far greater.<\/p>\n<p>When armed with the right facts, garnering budget dollars for better security solutions should become a much smoother process.

An early pioneer of software user experience, Mark helped forge the disciplines around user interface design and mobile platforms. <\/p>\n<p>Mark Rolston will be speaking at the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/gigaom.com\/change\/\">Gigaom Change Leaders Summit<\/a><\/strong> in Austin, September 21-23rd. In anticipation of that, I caught up with him to ask a few questions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Byron Reese: Let\u2019s start with what you think we will be interfacing with machines in a decade?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Mark Rolston:<\/strong> For most of the 20th century we imagined our future with very physical visions: Massive superstructures, space travel, and amazing machines taking care of everything around us. Today we see the future arriving very quietly but no less profound than those visions. In ten years we will speak as often, or likely more, to machines as we do each other. With some of those machines we will even develop relationships that leverage human concepts such as trust and friendship. Everyone, everything, and everywhere will be codified, interactive, and addressable through ubiquitous interfaces scattered throughout our environments. And most profoundly we will be part cyborg. I don\u2019t mean we will have mechanical implants (although we might) but instead if we were to assess who we are we will find a great part of us has become reliant on our digital dopplegangers. Our friends and business associates will frequently interact with our digital selves. By the way we call this digital+physical new self \u201cMeta-Me\u201d. Many of these interactions will occur outside of our interference because our digital \u201cmeta-me\u201d has come to know us so intimately that it knows how you think. Today we rely on external systems such as maps and yelp to help make decisions. In ten years our minds will become so entwined with digital systems that we will scarcely recognize our own independence.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So you really think that in just ten years we will count machines among our friends? Do people want emotional relationships with machinery?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sure. We already show love for precious objects in our life- cars, furniture, memorabilia, etc. And obviously we find room to love our pets even if they may not love us back. I\u2019ve also watched my kids treat our Amazon Echo like a character, calling it \u201cher\u201d rather than \u201cit\u201d. So as everyday objects take on character it\u2019s not hard to imagine us lending affection towards them. This won\u2019t just happen overnight. It\u2019s happening now.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about the work you are currently doing?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As a product design group we\u2019re working on a range of digital and physical products. What\u2019s exciting about these projects is that they are all examples for how much the world is changing because of advances in computing. Our partnership with WrapMedia is focused on developing an on-demand interface for the emerging world of devices and systems that don\u2019t have their own interface. For example, if your car wants to tell you it needs an oil change, it needs a way to do that. In this scenario it sends you an instant application, called a \u2018wrap\u2019, that tells you where you can go for this oil change, helps you make the appointment, and offers you a discount on the visit. We are seeing incredible demand for GUIs that solve for these types of asymmetrical computing scenarios. We\u2019re also working on the next generation of our PEQ smart home user interface. The platform is expanding to do so much more than the first gen of smart home software. We just finished a program with Farmlink that brings big-data and sophisticated data-modeling to the farming industry through a very accessible mobile user interface. And we have a team doing research in Tanzania and Jordan around using digital tools to drive entrepreneurialism in developing markets. Overall these projects follow a familiar pattern\u2013 computing has disrupted everything in life, and design is needed to help build and make sense of it all.<\/p>\n<p>As a business argo is founded on a new model where we work as equity partners with our clients. Since our founding, we have established ten equity partnerships and have refined our process for working within this unique framework. The dynamics are very different because we act much more like an integral part of our partner\u2019s operation. In many cases, such as with WrapMedia and PEQ, we have been their entire product design team from day 1. it means the product is much more than just something we worked on. This model has helped us change the way we operate the business.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I would guess that technological advance is a double-edged sword with regard to interfaces. On the one hand, tech lets you do things that you never could before, like recognize gestures or speech. On the other hand, we want our devices to do almost everything, even anticipating our needs. That&#8217;s a far cry from back in the day when the entire interface to a vacuum cleaner was an on-off switch. How does all that net out? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It nets out in deep changes in how we relate to our world and each other. We\u2019re used to talking about the places and objects around us. Soon we will talk to them. Among the more interesting changes will be a potentially deep dependence on software for making decisions. Think about how digital maps have changed the way we find our way. Now apply that kind of shift to a much broader range of decisions we make every day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are the biggest challenges you are facing?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Every project we do is new\u2013 new problems, new concepts, new technologies, and new user expectations. On top of that we\u2019re often engaged with the client in our unique business model. Because of that we\u2019re constantly going in blind, developing the thinking as we go. But then again that\u2019s why we do this and why we love it. <\/p>\n<p><strong>What challenges will the larger world face as we come to need to interface with machines more and more?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The list is long but two things concern me the most: The first is what this rapid change is doing to our own humanity. Never in history have the basic affordances of human interaction changed so rapidly and dramatically. The second is that technology is fundamentally an accelerator. It can magnify whatever we choose. I think we all shared initial optimism that technology can be used to create more opportunity for everyone. And it has to a large extent. But I\u2019m seeing that we\u2019re entering a new era where technology is just as effective of a tool to accelerate imbalances in the world. Winners don\u2019t just win like they used to. Competitive advantage is radically magnified in digital. It makes competition more binary and that\u2019s often not a good thing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hmmm. Elaborate on that. I would have argued just the opposite. Technology enables vast numbers of new entrants to compete against established companies.  How would you have competed against Standard Oil a century ago? But today, anyone can compete against Microsoft. In fact, the simple fact that many of the greatest tech companies out there are less than two decades old, such as Google, Uber, Airbnb, Tesla, eBay, and Amazon,  sure looks like they can compete successfully. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ok, this part of the conversation wades deep into politics and what each of us believes the role technology will play in society and economics, but it is important that we not assume tech is only a force for good. I love that tech has brought about seismic shifts and ushered in a new era of companies. Amazon, Uber, Airbnb, etc. are great examples of disruption from tech. Uber is an example where we\u2019re consolidating 100s of separate companies into one global transportation behemoth. The upside is that they\u2019re killing off what we hated about taxi service. The downside is a consolidation of economic power and the commoditization of employment. Not every disruption will net out positive once the dust has settled.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts on this subject.
